      <title>Enumeration of plane triangulations with all vertices of degree $3$ or $6$ and a new characterization of akempic triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13316v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plane triangulations with all vertices of degree $3$ or $6$ are enumerated.
  A plane triangulation is said to be akempic if it has a $4$-colouring such that no two adjacent triangles have the same three colours and this colouring is not Kempe equivalent to any other colouring. Mohar (1985 and 1987) characterized and enumerated akempic triangulations with all vertices of degree $3$ or $6$. We give a new characterization of the akempic triangulations and a new proof of the Mohar enumeration theorem.</description>

      <title>Partial results for union-closed conjectures on the weighted cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated union-closed conjecture is concerned with the cardinalities of various subsets of the Boolean $d$-cube. The cardinality of such a set is equivalent, up to a constant, to its measure under the uniform distribution, so we can pose more general conjectures by choosing a different probability distribution on the cube. In particular, for any sequence of probabilities $(p_i)_{i=1}^d$ we can consider the product of $d$ independent Bernoulli random variables, with success probabilities $p_i$. In this short note, we find a generalised form of Karpas' special case of the union-closed conjecture for families $\F$ with density at least half. We also generalise Knill's logarithmic lower bound.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Block Pillar Structure in the Kolakoski Sequence K(1,3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kolakoski sequence K(a,b) over {a, b} is the unique sequence starting with a that equals its own run-length encoding. While the classical case K(1,2) remains deeply enigmatic, generalizations exhibit markedly different behaviors depending on the parity of a and b. The sequence K(1,3), a same-parity case over the alphabet {1,3}, is known to possess regular structure and a calculable symbol frequency. This paper reveals a complementary structural property: a nested block-pillar recursion of the form B_{n+1} = B_n + P_n + B_n, and P_{n+1} = G(P_n, 3), where each B_n is a prefix of K(1,3), and G is a generation operator based on run-length encoding. We show that B_{n+1} = G(B_n, 1), leading to a self-replicating description of K(1,3). This structure allows derivation of exact recurrences for length, symbol counts, and density, proving exponential growth and convergence to the known limit d = (5 - sqrt(5)) / 10. Our analysis highlights the structured nature of same-parity Kolakoski sequences and offers a constructive alternative to morphic generation.</description>

      <title>On the Averaging Problem of Ideal Families Related to Frankl's Conjecture with Formal Proof by Lean 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frankl's conjecture, also known as the union-closed sets conjecture, can be equivalently expressed in terms of intersection-closed set families by considering the complements of sets. It posits that any family of sets closed under intersections, and containing both the ground set and the empty set, must have a ``rare vertex'' -- a vertex belonging to at most half of the members of the family. The concept of \emph{average rarity} describes a set family where the average degree of all the elements is at most half of the number of its members. Average rarity is a stronger property that implies the existence of a rare vertex. This paper focuses on ideal families, which are set families that are downward-closed (except the ground set) and include the ground set. We present a proof that the normalized degree sum of any ideal family is non-positive, which is equivalent to saying that every ideal family satisfies the average rarity condition. This proof is formalized and verified using the Lean 4 theorem prover.</description>

      <title>A new definition for m-Cambrian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cambrian lattices, introduced in (Reading, 2006), generalize the Tamari lattice to any choice of Coxeter element in any finite Coxeter group. They are further generalized to the m-Cambrian lattices (Stump, Thomas, Williams, 2015). However, their definitions do not provide a practical setup to work with combinatorially. In this paper, we provide a new equivalent definition of the m-Cambrian lattices on simple objects called m-noncrossing partitions, using a simple and effective comparison criterion. It is obtained by showing that each interval has a unique maximal chain that is c-increasing, which is computed by a greedy algorithm. Our proof is uniform, involving all Coxeter groups and all choices of Coxeter element at the same time. This work has been accepted as an extended abstract for the FPSAC 2025 conference. A long version of this work will be available later.</description>

      <title>On $\ell-$regular and $2-$color partition triples modulo powers of $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T_\ell(n)$ denote the number of $\ell-$regular partition triples of $n$ and let $p_{\ell, 3}(n)$ enumerates the number of 2--color partition triples of $n$ where one of the colors appear only in parts that are multiples of $\ell$. In this paper, we prove several infinite families of congruences modulo powers of 3 for $T_\ell(n)$ and $p_{\ell, 3}(n)$, where $\ell \geq 1$ and $\equiv 0\pmod{3^k}$, and $\equiv \pm 3^k \pmod{3^{k+1}}$.</description>

      <title>Singular walks in the quarter plane and Bernoulli numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider singular (aka genus $0$) walks in the quarter plane and their associated generating functions $Q(x,y,t)$, which enumerate the walks starting from the origin, of fixed endpoint (encoded by the spatial variables $x$ and $y$) and of fixed length (encoded by the time variable $t$). We first prove that the previous series can be extended up to a universal value of $t$ (in the sense that this holds for all singular models), namely $t=\frac{1}{2}$, and we provide a probabilistic interpretation of $Q(x,y,\frac{1}{2})$. As a second step, we refine earlier results in the literature and show that $Q(x,y,t)$ is indeed differentially transcendental for any $t\in(0,\frac{1}{2}]$. Moreover, we prove that $Q(x,y,\frac{1}{2})$ is strongly differentially transcendental. As a last step, we show that for certain models the series expansion of $Q(x,y,\frac{1}{2})$ is directly related to Bernoulli numbers. This provides a second proof of its strong differential transcendence.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-numbers, diophantine exponent and factorisations of sturmian words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $\alpha$-numbers and formal intercept of sturmian words, and derive from this study general factorisations formula for sturmian words. Sturmian words are defined as infinite words with lowest unbound complexity, and are characterized by two parameters, the first one being well-known as the slope, and the second being their formal intercepts. We build this formalism by a study of Rauzy graphs of sturmian words, and we use this caracterisation to compute the repetition function of sturmian words and their diophantine exponent. We then develop these techniques to provide general factorisations formulas for sturmian words.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is perfectly divisible if for each of its induced subgraph $H$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B]) &lt; \omega(H)$. A graph $G$ is perfectly weight divisible if for every positive integral weight function on $V(G)$ and each of its induced subgraph $H$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and the maximum weight of a clique in $H[B]$ is smaller than the maximum weight of a clique in $H$. In this paper, we prove that the perfect divisibility of a graph is equivalent to its perfect weighted divisibility.</description>

      <title>Ordered Yao graphs: maximum degree, edge numbers, and clique numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$ and an ordered set of $n$ points in the plane, define its k-sector ordered Yao graphs as follows. Divide the plane around each point into $k$ equal sectors and draw an edge from each point to its closest predecessor in each of the $k$ sectors. We analyze several natural parameters of these graphs. Our main results are as follows:
  I) Let $d_k(n)$ be the maximum integer so that for every $n$-element point set in the plane, there exists an order such that the corresponding $k$-sector ordered Yao graph has maximum degree at least $d_k(n)$. We show that $d_k(n)=n-1$ if $k=4$ or $k \ge 6$, and provide some estimates for the remaining values of $k$. Namely, we show that $d_1(n) = \Theta( \log_2n )$; $\frac{1}{2}(n-1) \le d_3(n) \le 5\left\lceil\frac{n}{6}\right\rceil-1$; $\frac{2}{3}(n-1) \le d_5(n) \le n-1$;
  II) Let $e_k(n)$ be the minimum integer so that for every $n$-element point set in the plane, there exists an order such that the corresponding $k$-sector ordered Yao graph has at most $e_k(n)$ edges. Then $e_k(n)=\left\lceil\frac{k}{2}\right\rceil\cdot n-o(n)$.
  III) Let $w_k$ be the minimum integer so that for every point set in the plane, there exists an order such that the corresponding $k$-sector ordered Yao graph has clique number at most $w_k$. Then $\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil \le w_k\le \lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil+1$.
  All the orders mentioned above can be constructed effectively.</description>

      <title>Levenshtein's Sequence Reconstruction Problem and Results for Larger Alphabet Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of storing large amounts of information safely for a long period of time has become essential. One of the most promising new data storage mediums are the polymer-based data storage systems, like the DNA-storage system. These storage systems are highly durable and they consume very little energy to store the data. When information is retrieved from a storage, however, several different types of errors may occur in the process. It is known that the Levenshtein's sequence reconstruction framework is well-suited to overcome such errors and to retrieve the original information. Many of the previous results regarding Levenshtein's sequence reconstruction method are so far given only for the binary alphabet. However, larger alphabets are natural for the polymer-based data storage. For example, the quaternary alphabet is suitable for DNA-storage due to the four amino-acids in DNA. The results for larger alphabets often require, as we will see in this work, different and more complicated techniques compared to the binary case. Moreover, we show that an increase in the alphabet size makes some error types behave rather surprisingly.</description>

      <title>Using the quantum torus to investigate the $q$-Onsager algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $q$-Onsager algebra, denoted by $O_q$, is defined by generators $W_0, W_1$ and two relations called the $q$-Dolan-Grady relations. In 2017, Baseilhac and Kolb gave some elements of $O_q$ that form a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis. The quantum torus, denoted by $T_q$, is defined by generators $x, y, x^{-1}, y^{-1}$ and relations $$xx^{-1} = 1 = x^{-1}x, \qquad yy^{-1} = 1 = y^{-1}y, \qquad xy=q^2yx.$$ The set $\{x^iy^j | i,j \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ is a basis for $T_q$. It is known that there is an algebra homomorphism $p: O_q \mapsto T_q$ that sends $W_0 \mapsto x+x^{-1}$ and $W_1 \mapsto y+y^{-1}.$ In 2020, Lu and Wang displayed a variation of $O_q$, denoted by $\tilde{\mathbf{U}}^{\imath}$. Lu and Wang gave a surjective algebra homomorphism $\upsilon : \tilde{\mathbf{U}}^{\imath} \mapsto O_q.$ \medskip In their consideration of $\tilde{\mathbf{U}}^{\imath}$, Lu and Wang introduced some elements \begin{equation} \label{intrp503} \{B_{1,r}\}_{r \in \mathbb{Z}}, \qquad \{H'_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, \qquad \{H_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, \qquad \{\Theta'_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}, \qquad \{\Theta_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}. \nonumber \end{equation} These elements are defined using recursive formulas and generating functions, and it is difficult to express them in closed form. A similar problem applies to the Baseilhac-Kolb elements of $O_q$. To mitigate this difficulty, we map everything to $T_q$ using $p$ and $\upsilon$. In our main results, we express the resulting images in the basis for $T_q$ and also in an attractive closed form.</description>

      <title>Effective Computation of Generalized Abelian Complexity for Pisot Type Substitutive Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized abelian equivalence compares words by their factors up to a certain bounded length. The associated complexity function counts the equivalence classes for factors of a given size of an infinite sequence. How practical is this notion? When can these equivalence relations and complexity functions be computed efficiently? We study the fixed points of substitution of Pisot type. Each of their $k$-abelian complexities is bounded and the Parikh vectors of their length-$n$ prefixes form synchronized sequences in the associated Dumont--Thomas numeration system. Therefore, the $k$-abelian complexity of Pisot substitution fixed points is automatic in the same numeration system. Two effective generic construction approaches are investigated using the \texttt{Walnut} theorem prover and are applied to several examples. We obtain new properties of the Tribonacci sequence, such as a uniform bound for its factor balancedness together with a two-dimensional linear representation of its generalized abelian complexity functions.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite permutation group on $\Omega,$ a subgroup $K\leqslant G$ is called a fixer if each element in $K$ fixes some element in $\Omega.$ In this paper, we characterize fixers $K$ with $|K|\geqslant |G_\omega|$ for each primitive action of almost simple group $G$ with socle ${}^2G_2(q).$</description>

      <title>Cops and Robbers for Graphs on Surfaces with Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a game played on a graph where a set of cops attempt to capture a single robber. The game proceeds in rounds, where each round first consists of the cops' turn, followed by the robber's turn. In the cops' turn, every cop can choose to either stay on the same vertex or move to an adjacent vertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. The robber is considered to be captured if, at any point in time, there is some cop on the same vertex as the robber. A natural question in this game concerns the cop-number of a graph -- the minimum number of cops needed to capture the robber. It has long been known that graphs embeddable (without crossings) on surfaces of bounded genus have bounded cop-number. In contrast, the class of 1-planar graphs -- graphs that can be drawn on the plane with at most one crossing per edge -- does not have bounded cop-number. This paper initiates an investigation into how distance between crossing pairs of edges influences a graph's cop number. In particular, we look at Distance $d$ Cops and Robbers, a variant of the classical game, where the robber is considered to be captured if there is a cop within distance $d$ of the robber. Let $c_d(G)$ denote the minimum number of cops required in the graph $G$ to capture a robber within distance $d$. We look at various classes of graphs, such as 1-plane graphs, $k$-plane graphs (graphs where each edge is crossed at most $k$ times), and even general graph drawings, and show that if every crossing pair of edges can be connected by a path of small length, then $c_d(G)$ is bounded, for small values of $d$.</description>

      <title>Free Inhomogeneous Wreath Product of Compact Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the free inhomogeneous wreath product of compact matrix quantum groups, which generalizes the free wreath product (Bichon 2004). We use this to present a general technique to determine quantum automorphism groups of connected graphs in terms of their maximal biconnected subgraphs, provided that we have sufficient information about their quantum automorphism groups. We show that this requirement is met for forests, outerplanar graphs, and block graphs leading to algorithms to compute the quantum automorphism groups of these graphs.</description>

      <title>On Refined Vogel's universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13831v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In accordance with P. Vogel, a set of algebra structures in Chern-Simons theory can be made universal, independent of a particular family of simple Lie algebras. In particular, this means that various quantities in the adjoint representations of these simple Lie algebras such as dimensions and quantum dimensions, Racah coefficients, etc. are simple rational functions of two parameters on Vogel's plane, giving three lines associated with $sl$, $so/sp$ and exceptional algebras correspondingly. By analyzing the partition function of refined of Chern-Simons theory, it was suggested earlier that the refinement may preserve the universality for simply laced algebras. Here we support this conjecture by analysing the Macdonald dimensions, i.e. values of Macdonald polynomials at $q^\rho$, where $\rho$ is the Weyl vector: there is a universality formula that describes these dimensions for the simply laced algebras as a function on the Vogel's plane.</description>

      <title>Limiting spectral laws for sparse random circulant matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a positive integer $d$ and let $(G_n)_{n\geq1}$ be a sequence of finite abelian groups with orders tending to infinity. For each $n \geq 1$, let $C_n$ be a uniformly random $G_n$-circulant matrix with entries in $\{0,1\}$ and exactly $d$ ones in each row/column. We show that the empirical spectral distribution of $C_n$ converges weakly in expectation to a probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{C}$ if and only if the distribution of the order of a uniform random element of $G_n$ converges weakly to a probability measure $\rho$ on $\mathbb{N}^*$, the one-point compactification of the natural numbers. Furthermore, we show that convergence in expectation can be strengthened to convergence in probability if and only if $\rho$ is a Dirac mass $\delta_m$. In this case, $\mu$ is the $d$-fold convolution of the uniform distribution on the $m$-th roots of unity if $m\in\mathbb{N}$ or the unit circle if $m = \infty$. We also establish that, under further natural assumptions, the determinant of $C_n$ is $\pm\exp((c_{m,d}+o(1))|G_n|)$ with high probability, where $c_{m,d}$ is a constant depending only on $m$ and $d$.</description>

      <title>On the Treewidth of Token and Johnson Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and $1 \le k \le n$ a fixed integer. The \textit{$k$-token graph} of $G$ is the graph $F_k(G)$ whose vertex set consists of all $k$-subsets of the vertex set of $G$, where two vertices $A$ and $B$ are adjacent in $F_k(G)$ whenever their symmetric difference $A\triangle B$ is an edge of $G$. In this paper we study the treewidth of $F_k(G)$ when $G$ is a star, path, or a complete graph. We show that in the first two cases, the treewidth is of order $\Theta(n^{k-1})$, and of order $\Theta(n^k)$ in the third case. We conjecture that our upper bound for the treewidth of $F_k(K_n)$ is tight. This is particularly relevant since $F_k(K_n)$ is isomorphic to the well known Johnson graph $J(n,k)$.</description>

Abstract: We study the tropicalization of the variety of symmetric rank two matrices. Analogously to the result of Markwig and Yu for general tropical rank two matrices, we show that it has a simplicial complex structure as the space of symmetric bicolored trees and that this simplicial complex is shellable. We also discuss some matroid structures arising from this space and present generating functions for the number of symmetric bicolored trees.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the number of colours needed to nicely colour a sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hadwiger--Nelson problem is about determining the chromatic number of the plane (CNP), defined as the minimum number of colours needed to colour the plane so that no two points of distance 1 have the same colour. In this paper we investigate a related problem for spheres and we use a few natural restrictions on the colouring. Thomassen showed that with these restrictions, the chromatic number of all manifolds satisfying certain properties (including the plane and all spheres with a large enough radius) is at least 7. We prove that with these restrictions, the chromatic number of any sphere with a large enough radius is at least 8. This also gives a new lower bound for the minimum colours needed for colouring the 3-dimensional space with the same restrictions.</description>

Abstract: We give a combinatorial proof of the following theorem. Let $G$ be any finite group acting transitively on a set of cardinality $n$. If $S \subseteq G$ is a random set of size $k$, with $k \geq (\log n)^{1+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon &gt;0$, then the diameter of the corresponding Schreier graph is $O(\log_k n)$ with high probability. Except for the implicit constant, this result is the best possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the \emph{$\alpha$-chromatic symmetric functions} $\chi^{(\alpha)}_\pi[X;q]$, extending Shareshian and Wachs' chromatic symmetric functions with an additional real parameter $\alpha$. We present positive combinatorial formulas with explicit interpretations. Notably, we show an explicit monomial expansion in terms of the $\alpha$-binomial basis and an expansion into certain chromatic symmetric functions in terms of the $\alpha$-falling factorial basis. Among various connections with other subjects, we highlight a significant link to $q$-rook theory, including a new solution to the $q$-hit problem posed by Garsia and Remmel in their 1986 paper introducing $q$-rook polynomials.</description>

      <title>A two-player voting game in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite set $S$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we regard as the locations of voters on a $d$-dimensional political `spectrum', two candidates (Alice and Bob) select one point in $\mathbb{R}^d$ each, in an attempt to get as many votes as possible. Alice goes first and Bob goes second, and then each voter simply votes for the candidate closer to them in terms of Euclidean distance. If a voter's distance from the two candidates is the same, they vote for nobody. We give a geometric characterization of the sets $S$ for which each candidate wins, assuming that Alice wins if they get an equal number of votes. We also show that, if not all the voters lie on a single line, then, whenever Alice has a winning strategy, there is a unique winning point for her. We also provide an algorithm which decides whether Alice has a winning point, and determines the location of that point, both in finite (in fact polynomial) time.</description>

      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree II: Overview and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades are recursively (from the root) split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto 1/(i(m-i))$. Study of structure theory and explicit quantitative aspects of this model (in discrete or continuous versions) is an active research topic. For many results there are different proofs, probabilistic or analytic, so the model provides a testbed for a ``compare and contrast" discussion of techniques. This article provides an overview of results proved in the sequence of similarly-titled articles I, III, IV and related articles. We mostly do not repeat proofs given elsewhere: instead we seek to paint a ``Big Picture" via graphics and heuristics, and emphasize open problems.
  Our discussion is centered around three categories of results. (i) There is a CLT for leaf heights, and the analytic proofs can be extended to provide surprisingly precise analysis of other height-related aspects. (ii) There is an explicit description of the limit {\em fringe distribution} relative to a random leaf, whose graphical representation is essentially the format of the cladogram representation of biological phylogenies. (iii) There is a canonical embedding of the discrete model into a continuous-time model, that is a random tree CTCS(n) on $n$ leaves with real-valued edge lengths, and this model turns out more convenient to study. The family (CTCS(n), n \ge 2) is consistent under a ``delete random leaf and prune" operation. That leads to an explicit inductive construction of (CTCS(n), n \ge 2) as $n$ increases, and then to a limit structure CTCS($\infty$) formalized via exchangeable partitions.
  Many open problems remain, in particular to elucidate a relation between CTCS($\infty$) and the $\beta(2,1)$ coalescent.</description>

      <title>Bubble sort and Howe duality for staircase matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an independent proof of the Cauchy identities for staircase matrices, originally discovered in arXiv:2411.03117, using the combinatorics of the Bruhat poset and the bubble-sort procedure. Additionally, we derive new insights into certain coefficients appearing in one of these identities. The first part of the paper focuses on combinatorial aspects. It is self-contained, of independent interest, and introduces a generalization of parabolic Bruhat graphs for monotone functions on an arborescent poset. The second part examines the intersections of Demazure modules within a given integrable representation. Finally, we propose a generalization of the classical Howe duality for staircase matrices in terms of the corresponding distributive lattice of Demazure submodules. Computing the associated character yields the desired Cauchy identities for staircase matrices.</description>
