      <title>Vulnerability of multilayer network systems to system-wide lesions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the basis of structural and flow models of multilayer network system (MLNS), the main structural and functional importance indicators of separate layers in the process of intersystem interactions are calculated. With the help of influence and betweenness parameters of separate layers, their role as generators, final receivers and transitors of intersystem flows is determined. Using the introduced importance indicators, effective scenarios of system-wide targeted attacks on MLNS are developed. The problem of the scale of targeted attacks and non-target lesions consequences for the network system (NS) and determination of its protection and sensitivity to various negative influences is analyzed. The advantages of flow-based approach over the structural ones during the study of vulnerability of NS and MLNS to heterogeneous internal and external negative influences are shown.</description>

      <title>Value of risk-contact data from digital contact monitoring apps in infectious disease modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple method to integrate risk-contact data, obtained via digital contact monitoring (DCM) apps, in conventional compartmental transmission models. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many such data have been collected for the first time via newly developed DCM apps. However, it is unclear what the added value of these data is, unlike that of traditionally collected data via, e.g., surveys during non-epidemic times. The core idea behind our method is to express the number of infectious individuals as a function of the proportion of contacts that were with infected individuals and use this number as a starting point to initialize the remaining compartments of the model. As an important consequence, using our method, we can estimate key indicators such as the effective reproduction number using only two types of daily aggregated contact information, namely the average number of contacts and the average number of those contacts that were with an infected individual. We apply our method to the recent COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands, using self-reported data from the health surveillance app COVID RADAR and proximity-based data from the contact tracing app CoronaMelder. For both data sources, our corresponding estimates of the effective reproduction number agree both in time and magnitude with estimates based on other more detailed data sources such as daily numbers of cases and hospitalizations. This suggests that the use of DCM data in transmission models, regardless of the precise data type and for example via our method, offers a promising alternative for estimating the state of an epidemic, especially when more detailed data are not available.</description>

      <title>Weighted simple games and the topology of simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use simplicial complexes to model simple games as well as weighted voting games where certain coalitions are considered impossible. Topological characterizations of various ideas from simple games are provided, as are the expressions for Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik power indices for weighted games. We calculate the indices in several examples of weighted voting games with unfeasible coalitions, including the U.S. Electoral College and the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina.</description>

      <title>Topological Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.</description>

      <title>The relevance of higher-order ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order networks effectively represent complex systems with group interactions. Existing methods usually overlook the relative contribution of group interactions (hyperlinks) of different sizes to the overall network structure. Yet, this has many important applications, especially when the network has meaningful node labels. In this work, we propose a comprehensive methodology to precisely measure the contribution of different orders to the overall network structure. First, we propose the order contribution measure, which quantifies the contribution of hyperlinks of different orders to the link weights (local scale), number of triangles (mesoscale) and size of the largest connected component (global scale) of the pairwise weighted network. Second, we propose the measure of order relevance, which gives insights in how hyperlinks of different orders contribute to the considered network property. Most interestingly, it enables an assessment of whether this contribution is synergistic or redundant with respect to that of hyperlinks of other orders. Third, to account for labels, we propose a metric of label group balance to assess how hyperlinks of different orders connect label-induced groups of nodes. We applied these metrics to a large-scale board interlock network and scientific collaboration network, in which node labels correspond to geographical location of the nodes. Experiments including a comparison with randomized null models reveal how from the global level perspective, we observe synergistic contributions of orders in the board interlock network, whereas in the collaboration network there is more redundancy. The findings shed new light on social scientific debates on the role of busy directors in global business networks and the connective effects of large author teams in scientific collaboration networks.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Society Caused by Collective and Individual Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision-making societies may vary in their level of cooperation and degree of conservatism, both of which influence their overall performance. Moreover, these factors are not fixed -- they can change based on the decisions agents in the society make in their interests. But can these changes lead to cyclical patterns in societal evolution? To explore this question, we use the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model. In this framework, the level of cooperation can be measured by group size, while the degree of conservatism is determined by the voting threshold. Agents can adopt either individualistic or group-oriented strategies when voting on stochastically generated external proposals. For Gaussian proposal generators, the expected capital gain (ECG) -- a measure of agents' performance -- can be expressed in standard mathematical functions. Our findings show that in neutral environments, societal evolution with open or democratic groups can follow cyclic patterns. We also find that highly conservative societies or conservative societies with low levels of cooperation can evolve into liberal (less conservative than majoritarian) societies and that mafia groups never let their members go when they want to.</description>

      <title>The Diffusive Nature of Housing Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the French housing market prices in the period 1970-2022, with high-resolution data from 2018 to 2022. The spatial correlation of the observed price field exhibits logarithmic decay characteristic of the two-dimensional random diffusion equation -- local interactions may create long-range correlations. We introduce a stylized model, used in the past to model spatial regularities in voting patterns, that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations with reasonable values of parameters. Our analysis reveals that price shocks are persistent in time and their amplitude is strongly heterogeneous in space. Our study confirms and quantifies the diffusive nature of housing prices that was anticipated long ago (Clapp et al. 1994, Pollakowski et al. 1997), albeit on much restricted, local data sets.</description>

      <title>40 Years of Interdisciplinary Research: Phases, Origins, and Key Turning Points (1981-2020)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the historical evolution of interdisciplinary research (IDR) over a 40-year period, focusing on its dynamic trends, phases, and key turning points. We apply time series analysis to identify critical years for interdisciplinary citations (CYICs) and categorizes IDR into three distinct phases based on these trends: Period I (1981-2002), marked by sporadic and limited interdisciplinary activity; Period II (2003-2016), characterized by the emergence of large-scale IDR led primarily by Medicine, with significant breakthroughs in cloning and medical technology; and Period III (2017-present), where IDR became a widely adopted research paradigm. Our findings indicate that IDR has been predominantly concentrated within the Natural Sciences, with Medicine consistently at the forefront, and highlights increasing contributions from Engineering and Environmental disciplines as a new trend. These insights enhance the understanding of the evolution of IDR, its driving factors, and the shifts in the focus of interdisciplinary collaborations.</description>
