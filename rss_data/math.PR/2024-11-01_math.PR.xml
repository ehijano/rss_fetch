      <title>Dynkin Games for L\'evy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a verification theorem for solving a Dynkin game driven by a L\'evy process. The result requires finding two averaging functions that, composed respectively with the supremum and the infimum of the process, summed, and taked the expectation, provide the value function of the game. The optimal stopping rules are the respective hitting times of the support sets of the averaging functions. The proof relies on fluctuation identities of the underlying L\'evy process. We illustrate our result with three new simple examples, where the smooth pasting property of the solutions is not always present.</description>

      <title>Subcritical regimes in the Poisson Boolean percolation on Ahlfors regular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson Boolean percolation on a metric measure space is one of the percolation models. Intuitively, this model is obtained by collecting random balls whose centers form a Poisson point process. In 2008, Gou\'{e}r\'{e} proved that for $n \geq 2$, the Poisson Boolean percolation on $\mathbb{R}^n$ has the subcritical regime if and only if the radius distribution has finite $n$-th moment. In this paper, we extend Gou\'{e}r\'{e}'s result to Ahlfors regular metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Tightness for interlacing geometric random walk bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of line ensembles whose local structure is described by independent geometric random walk bridges, which have been conditioned to interlace with each other. The latter arise naturally in the context Schur processes, including their versions in a half-space and a finite interval with free or periodic boundary conditions. We show that under one-point tightness of the curves, these line ensembles are tight and any subsequential limit satisfies the Brownian Gibbs property. As an application of our tightness results, we show that sequences of spiked Schur processes, that were recently considered in arXiv:2408.08445, converge uniformly over compact sets to the Airy wanderer line ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic discrepancy of $m \times m$ matrices $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ belonging to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, which is a class of random symmetric matrices with independent normally distributed entries. In the setting $m^2 = o(n)$, our results show that there exists a signing $x \in \{\pm1\}^n$ such that the spectral norm of $\sum_{i=1}^n x_iA_i$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{nm}4^{-(1 + o(1))n/m^2})$ with high probability. This is best possible and settles a recent conjecture by Kunisky and Zhang.</description>

      <title>Hitting time mixing for the random transposition walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider shuffling a deck of $n$ cards, labeled $1$ through $n$, as follows: at each time step, pick one card uniformly with your right hand and another card, independently and uniformly with your left hand; then swap the cards. How long does it take until the deck is close to random?
  Diaconis and Shahshahani showed that this process undergoes cutoff in total variation distance at time $t = \lfloor n\log{n}/2 \rfloor$. Confirming a conjecture of N.~Berestycki, we prove the definitive ``hitting time'' version of this result: let $\tau$ denote the first time at which all cards have been touched. The total variation distance between the stopped distribution at $\tau$ and the uniform distribution on permutations is $o_n(1)$; this is best possible, since at time $\tau-1$, the total variation distance is at least $(1+o_n(1))e^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relaxation time for the Glauber dynamics of infinite volume critical ferromagnetic Ising model on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ at $d\geq5$. In this case, using the known log-Sobolev inequality in finite volumes, and conditional on an assumption on the 1-arm exponent of critical FK-Ising percolation, we show the temporal spin correlation function decays polynomially fast in time.</description>

Abstract: We consider an SPDE driven by a parabolic second order partial differential operator with a nonlinear random external forcing defined by a Gaussian noise that is white in time and has a spatially homogeneous covariance. We prove existence and uniqueness of a random field solution to this SPDE. Our main result concerns the space-time sample path regularity of its solution.</description>

      <title>Persistent hubs in CMJ branching processes with independent increments and preferential attachment trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence of trees $(\mathcal{T}_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains a \emph{persistent hub}, or displays \emph{degree centrality}, if there is a fixed node of maximal degree for all sufficiently large $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We derive sufficient criteria for the emergence of a persistent hub in genealogical trees associated with Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes with independent waiting times between births of individuals, and sufficient criteria for the non-emergence of a persistent hub. We also derive criteria for uniqueness of these persistent hubs. As an application, we improve results in the literature concerning the emergence of unique persistent hubs in generalised preferential attachment trees, in particular, allowing for cases where there may not be a \emph{Malthusian parameter} associated with the process. The approach we use is mostly self-contained, and does not rely on prior results about Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between percolation on the Cayley graphs of a group and the dynamical diversity of cellular automata on that group. Specifically, we demonstrate that Gilman's dichotomy between equicontinuity and sensitivity with respect to Bernoulli measures holds on a finitely generated group if and only if the group has a trivial percolation threshold. Consequently, we show that a countable group satisfies Gilman's dichotomy if and only if it is locally virtually cyclic.</description>

      <title>Optimal control problems driven by nonlinear degenerate Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-posedness of a class of optimal control problems is analysed, where the state equation couples a nonlinear degenerate Fokker-Planck equation with a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Such problems naturally arise as mean-field limits of Stochastic Differential models for multipopulation dynamics, where a large number of agents (followers) is steered through parsimonious intervention on a selected class of leaders. The proposed approach combines stability estimates for measure solutions of nonlinear degenerate Fokker-Planck equations with a general framework of assumptions on the cost functional, ensuring compactness and lower semicontinuity properties. The Lie structure of the state equations allows one for considering non-Lipschitz nonlinearities, provided some suitable dissipativity assumptions are considered in addition to non-Euclidean H\"{o}lder and sublinearity conditions.</description>

      <title>A Martingale-Free Introduction to Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System (CGNS) is a broad class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. Given the trajectories for a subset of state variables, the remaining follow a Gaussian distribution. Despite the conditionally linear structure, the CGNS exhibits strong nonlinearity, thus capturing many non-Gaussian characteristics observed in nature through its joint and marginal distributions. Desirably, it enjoys closed analytic formulae for the time evolution of its conditional Gaussian statistics, which facilitate the study of data assimilation and other related topics. In this paper, we develop a martingale-free approach to improve the understanding of CGNSs. This methodology provides a tractable approach to proving the time evolution of the conditional statistics by deriving results through time discretization schemes, with the continuous-time regime obtained via a formal limiting process as the discretization time-step vanishes. This discretized approach further allows for developing analytic formulae for optimal posterior sampling of unobserved state variables with correlated noise. These tools are particularly valuable for studying extreme events and intermittency and apply to high-dimensional systems. Moreover, the approach improves the understanding of different sampling methods in characterizing uncertainty. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a physics-constrained, triad-interaction climate model with cubic nonlinearity and state-dependent cross-interacting noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss Pitman's representation of a Markov process, which serves as a discrete analog to the Bessel 3D process starting at time 0 from an arbitrary initial law. This representation involves maxima of lazy simple random walks and an auxiliary independent random variable.
  The law of the auxiliary random variable is explicitly related to the initial law of the Markov process.
  The proof is kept at an elementary level and relies on a reconstruction formula for the generalized Pitman transform.
  We then use continuous-time limits to shed additional light on the relation between two representations of the Bessel 3D process that appeared in the description of the stationary measure of the KPZ fixed point on the half-line, as proposed by Barraquand and Le Doussal (2022).</description>

      <title>The isoperimetric problem for convex hulls and the large deviations rate functionals of random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the most likely trajectories of a planar random walk that result in large deviations of the area of their convex hull. If the Laplace transform of the increments is finite on $R^2$, such a scaled limit trajectory $h$ solves the inhomogeneous anisotropic isoperimetric problem for the convex hull, where the usual length of $h$ is replaced by the large deviations rate functional $\int_0^1 I(h'(t)) dt$ and $I$ is the rate function of the increments. Assuming that the distribution of increments is not supported on a half-plane, we show that the optimal trajectories are convex and satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation, which we solve explicitly for every $I$. The shape of these trajectories resembles the optimizers in the isoperimetric inequality for the Minkowski plane, found by Busemann (1947).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider partial sums of martingale differences weighted by random variables drawn uniformly on the sphere, and globally independent of the martingale differences. Combining Lindeberg's method and a series of arguments due to Bobkov, Chistyakov and G{\"o}tze, we show that the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of these weighted sums and the limiting Gaussian is "super-fast" of order (log n)^2 /n, under conditions allowing us to control the higher-order conditional moments of the martingale differences. We give an application of this result to the least squares estimator of the slope in the linear model with Gaussian design.</description>

We also prove the order of the limiting free energy and the limiting distribution of the fluctuation of the free energy for both regimes.</description>

      <title>From clonal interference to Poissonian interacting trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a population whose size $N$ is fixed over the generations, and in which random beneficial mutations arrive at a rate of order $1/\log N$ per generation. In this so-called Gerrish-Lenski regime, typically a finite number of contending mutations is present together with one resident type. These mutations compete for fixation, a phenomenon addressed as clonal interference. We study a system of Poissonian interacting trajectories (PIT) which arise as a large population scaling limit of the logarithmic sizes of the contending clonal subpopulations. We prove that this system exhibits an a.s.\ positive asymptotic rate of fitness increase (speed of adaptation), which turns out to be finite if and only if fitness increments have a finite expectation. We relate this speed to heuristic predictions from the literature. Furthermore, we derive a functional central limit theorem for the fitness of the resident population in the PIT. A main result of this work is that the Poissonian interacting trajectories arise as a large-population limit of a continuous time Moran model with strong selection.</description>

      <title>Random walk on dynamical percolation in Euclidean lattices: separating critical and supercritical regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the random walk on dynamical percolation of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (resp., the two-dimensional triangular lattice $\mathcal{T}$), where each edge (resp., each site) can be either open or closed, refreshing its status at rate $\mu\in (0,1/e]$. The random walk moves along open edges in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (resp., open sites in $\mathcal{T}$) at rate $1$. For the critical regime $p=p_c$, we prove the following two results: on $\mathcal{T}$, the mean squared displacement of the random walk from $0$ to $t$ is at most $O(t\mu^{5/132-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$; on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\geq 11$, the corresponding upper bound for the mean squared displacement is $O(t \mu^{1/2}\log(1/\mu))$. For the supercritical regime $p&gt;p_c$, we prove that the mean squared displacement on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is at least $ct$ for some $c=c(d)&gt;0$ that does not depend on $\mu$.</description>

      <title>$SLE_6$ and 2-d critical bond percolation on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Entrance boundary for standard processes with no negative jumps and its application to exponential convergence to the Yaglom limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study standard processes with no negative jumps under the entrance boundary condition. Similarly to one-dimensional diffusions, we show that the process can be made into a Feller process by attaching the boundary point to the state space. We investigate the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator in detail via the scale function, characterizing it as the zeros of an entire function. As an application, we prove that under the strong Feller property, the convergence to the Yaglom limit of the process killed at the boundary is exponentially fast.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the stochastic thin-film equation for initial values with non-full support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic thin-film equation with mobility exponent $n\in [\frac{8}{3},3)$ on the one-dimensional torus with multiplicative Stratonovich noise is considered. We show that martingale solutions exist for non-negative initial values. This advances on existing results in three aspects: (1) Non-quadratic mobility with not necessarily strictly positive initial data, (2) Measure-valued initial data, (3) Less spatial regularity of the noise. This is achieved by carrying out a compactness argument based solely on the control of the $\alpha$-entropy dissipation and the conservation of mass.</description>

      <title>Seeding with Differentially Private Network Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16590v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In public health interventions such as the distribution of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, decision makers rely on seeding algorithms to identify key individuals who can amplify the impact of their interventions. In such cases, building a complete sexual activity network is often infeasible due to privacy concerns. Instead, contact tracing can provide influence samples, that is, sequences of sexual contacts without requiring complete network information. This presents two challenges: protecting individual privacy in contact data and adapting seeding algorithms to work effectively with incomplete network information. To solve these two problems, we study privacy guarantees for influence maximization algorithms when the social network is unknown and the inputs are samples of prior influence cascades that are collected at random and need privacy protection. Building on recent results that address seeding with costly network information, our privacy-preserving algorithms introduce randomization in the collected data or the algorithm output and can bound the privacy loss of each node (or group of nodes) in deciding to include their data in the algorithm input. We provide theoretical guarantees of seeding performance with a limited sample size subject to differential privacy budgets in both central and local privacy regimes. Simulations on synthetic random graphs and empirically grounded sexual contacts of men who have sex with men reveal the diminishing value of network information with decreasing privacy budget in both regimes and graceful decrease in performance with decreasing privacy budget in the central regime. Achieving good performance with local privacy guarantees requires relatively higher privacy budgets that confirm our theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Annealed Multiple Choice Learning: Overcoming limitations of Winner-takes-all with annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL) which combines simulated annealing with MCL. MCL is a learning framework handling ambiguous tasks by predicting a small set of plausible hypotheses. These hypotheses are trained using the Winner-takes-all (WTA) scheme, which promotes the diversity of the predictions. However, this scheme may converge toward an arbitrarily suboptimal local minimum, due to the greedy nature of WTA. We overcome this limitation using annealing, which enhances the exploration of the hypothesis space during training. We leverage insights from statistical physics and information theory to provide a detailed description of the model training trajectory. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, on the standard UCI benchmark, and on speech separation.</description>
