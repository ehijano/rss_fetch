      <title>Topological insights into dense frictional suspension rheology: Third order loops drive discontinuous shear thickening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense suspensions exhibit significant viscosity changes under external deformation, a phenomenon known as shear thickening. Recent studies have identified a stress-induced transition from lubricated, unconstrained interactions to frictional contacts, which play a crucial role in shear thickening. This work investigates the rheological behavior and contact network evolution during continuous and discontinuous shear thickening (CST and DST) in two-dimensional simulations. We find that at low stress, during weak thickening, the frictional contact network is composed of quasilinear chains along the compression axis. With increasing stress, the contact network becomes more isotropic, and forms loop-like structures. We show that third-order loops within the frictional contact network are key to this behavior. Our findings revealed a strong correlation between the number of edges in the third-order loops and the viscosity of the suspension. Notably, this relationship remains independent of the packing fraction, applied stress, and interparticle friction, highlighting the fundamental role of the mesoscale network topology in governing macroscopic rheology.</description>

      <title>The space writhes and signatures of polymer knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space writhe of a knot is a property of its three-dimensional embedding that contains information about its underlying topology, but the correspondence between space writhe and other topological invariants is not fully understood. We perform Langevin dynamics simulations of knotted semiflexible polymers and measure their ensemble average space writhe. We show that for all knots up to 10 crossings, alternating and non-alternating, the average space writhe is almost equal to that of the tightest known configuration of the same knot, with minor differences. Using this equivalence, we show that for more complex knots with up to 38 crossings, the average space writhe is strongly correlated with the signature of the knot. This establishes that the connection between signature and space writhe holds at larger crossing numbers.</description>

      <title>Note on two-point mean square displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When probe molecules of interest are embedded in a container or aggregate under stochastic motion, one needs to rely on the so-called two-point mean square displacement (MSD) measurement to extract the intrinsic mobility of the probes. We discuss two versions, based on the time series of relative vector or distance between two probes, and summarize their basic properties compared to the standard MSD. We also propose a way to extract (i) the non-Gaussianity in the displacement statistics and (ii) the motional correlation between probes from the two-point MSD. The results are presented not only for independent probes, but also for intramolecular probes within a long polymer, which could be useful in quantifying the dynamics of chromatin loci in living cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Jamming transition and normal modes of polydispersed soft particle packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jamming transition of soft particles characterized by narrow size distributions has been well studied by physicists. However, polydispersed systems are more relevant to engineering, and the influence of polydispersity on jamming phenomena is still unexplored. Here, we numerically investigate jamming transitions of polydispersed soft particles in two dimensions. We find that polydispersity strongly influences contact forces, local coordination, and the jamming transition density. In contrast, the critical scaling of pressure and elastic moduli is not affected by the particle size distribution. Consistent with this observation, we find that the vibrational density of states is also insensitive to the polydispersity. Our results suggest that, regardless of particle size distributions, both mechanical and vibrational properties of soft particle packings near jamming are governed by the distance to jamming.</description>

      <title>The underappreciated role of nonspecific interactions in the crystallization of DNA-coated colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the field of programmable self-assembly has seen an explosion in the diversity of crystal lattices that can be synthesized from DNA-coated colloidal nanometer- and micrometer-scale particles. The prevailing wisdom has been that a particular crystal structure can be targeted by designing the DNA-mediated interactions, to enforce binding between specific particle pairs, and the particle diameters, to control the packing of the various species. In this article, we show that other ubiquitous nonspecific interactions can play equally important roles in determining the relative stability of different crystal polymorphs and therefore what crystal structure is most likely to form in an experiment. For a binary mixture of same-sized DNA-coated colloidal micrometer-scale particles, we show how changing the magnitudes of nonspecific steric and van der Waals interactions gives rise to a family of binary body-centered tetragonal crystals, including both cesium-chloride and copper-gold crystals. Simulations using pair potentials that account for these interactions reproduce our experimental observations quantitatively, and a theoretical model reveals how a subtle balance between specific and nonspecific forces determines the equilibrium crystal structure. These results highlight the importance of accounting for nonspecific interactions in the crystal-engineering design process.</description>

      <title>Decoding active force fluctuations from spatial trajectories of active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscopic active systems exhibit various unique behaviours - absent in passive systems - due to the forces generated by the corresponding constituents by converting their available free energies. However, finding out these forces - which are also stochastic and remain intertwined with the thermal noise - is especially non-trivial. Here, we introduce a technique to extract such fluctuating active forces, with statistical accuracy, acting on a passive particle immersed in an active bath by filtering out the related thermal noise. First, we test the efficacy of our method under numerical scenarios and then apply it to the experimental trajectories of a microscopic particle (optically) trapped inside an active bath consisting of motile E.Coli. bacteria. We believe that our approach would be rather effective in the actual measurement of unknown active forces, which are a crucial component in processes involving living matter.</description>

      <title>Entropic organization of topologically modified ring polymers in spherical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that under high cylindrical confinement, two ring polymers with excluded volume interactions between monomers, segregate to two halves of the cylinder to maximize their entropy. In contrast, two ring polymers remain mixed within a sphere, as there is no symmetry breaking direction [Nat Rev Microbiol, 8, 600-607 (2010)]. Therefore, in order to observe emergent organization of ring polymers in a sphere, we can introduce an asymmetric topological modification to the polymer architecture by creating a small loop and a big loop within the ring polymer. We consider the bead-spring model of polymers where there are only repulsive excluded volume interactions between the monomers ensuring that the organization we observe is purely entropy-driven. We find that for a single topologically modified polymer within a sphere, the monomers of the bigger loop are statistically more probable to be found closer to the periphery. However, the situation is reversed when we have multiple such topologically modified polymers in a sphere. The monomers of the small loops are found closer to the walls of the sphere. We can increase this localization and radial organization of polymer segments by increasing the number of small loops in each ring polymer. We study how these loops interact with each other within a polymer, as well as with loops of other polymers in spherical confinement. We compare contact maps of multiple such topologically modified polymers in a sphere. Finally, we discuss the plausible relevance of our studies to eukaryotic chromosomes that are confined within a spherical nucleus.</description>

      <title>Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass: role of non-affine flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory effect reflects a system's ability to encode, retain and retrieve information about its past. Such effects are essentially an out-of-equilibrium phenomenon providing insight into the complex structural and dynamical behavior of the system. Kovacs effect is one such memory effect that is traditionally associated with thermal history. Although studies on the Kovacs-like memory effect have been extended to mechanical perturbations such as compression-decompression, whether such effects can also be observed under volume-conserving perturbations like shear, remains unclear. Combining experiments, simulations and linear response theory we demonstrate Kovacs-like memory effect in a sheared colloidal glass. Moreover, we explore the influence of non-linear perturbations and establish a correlation between the deviation from linear response prediction and microscopic non-affine flows generated due to such large deformations in affecting the memory effect. Our study not only extends Kovacs-like memory effect in the domain of volume-conserving mechanical perturbations, it also highlights the importance of the nature of underlying microscopic flows in controlling the memory effect in amorphous matter.</description>

      <title>The effect of stereochemical constraints on the radius of gyration of folded proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins are composed of linear chains of amino acids that fold into complex three-dimensional structures. A general feature of folded proteins is that they are compact with a radius of gyration $R_g(N) \sim N^{\nu}$ that obeys power-law scaling with the number of amino acids $N$ in each protein and $\nu \sim 1/3$. In this study, we investigate the {\it internal} scaling of the radius of gyration $R_g(n)$ versus the chemical separation $n$ between amino acids for all subchains of length $n$. We show that for globular proteins $R_g(n) \sim n^{\nu_{1,2}}$ with a larger exponent $\nu_1 &gt; 1/3$ for small $n$ and a smaller exponent $\nu_{2} &lt; 1/3$ for large $n$, such that $R_g(N) \propto N^\nu$. To describe this scaling behavior for $R_g(n)$, we carry out folding simulations for a series of coarse-grained models for proteins beginning with the freely-jointed and freely-rotating chain models composed of spherical monomers and varying degrees of stereochemical constraints. We show that a minimal model, which coarse-grains amino acids into a single spherical backbone atom and one variable-sized spherical side-chain atom, and enforces bend- and dihedral-angle constraints, can recapitulate $R_g(n)$ for x-ray crystal structures of globular proteins. In addition, this model predicts the correct average packing fraction and size of the hydrophobic core, which are two key physical features that can be used to distinguish between computational `decoys' and correctly folded proteins in protein design applications.</description>

      <title>Connecting Shear Thinning and Dynamic Heterogeneity in Supercooled Liquids by Localized Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic heterogeneity and shear thinning are two universal dynamic phenomena in supercooled liquids, respectively at the microscopic level and the macroscopic level. With simulation, we show that they are quantitatively bridged by localized elasticity embodied as transient clusters that elastically respond to shear. Prominent dynamic heterogeneity emerges right after the massive yielding of these clusters, which is initiated by shear transformation zones and facilitated by elastically mediated interaction. With this picture, a scaling law relating shear thinning to the characteristic length scale of dynamic heterogeneity is found.</description>

      <title>Impact of Composition and Chain Length on the Interfacial and Thermodynamic Properties of Cyclic and Linear Polymer Blends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the structural properties of a cyclic and linear polymer blend confined within interfaces, comparing the properties of the different polymer systems as their composition and length vary through molecular dynamics simulations. Our analysis reveals that the local composition orderings of cyclic and linear polymers near the surface exhibit distinct differences. However, at longer lengths and increasing the cyclic concentration, it was shown that heat capacity increases until it gets to a threshold whereby increasing the length or cyclic concentration results in decrease and subsequently similar values. Notably, our findings indicate the stress-related properties of polymer blends and the influence of molecular weight and chain structure on developing sustainable strategies for lessening the environmental impact of polymers</description>

      <title>Inverted Temperature Gradients in Gold-Palladium Antenna-Reactor Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to enhanced fields and possible charge transfer, the concentration of photothermal energy at the nanoscale is a foundation of plasmon-driven photochemistry. We demonstrate a further enhancement of heat localization during the dissipation of energy in a bimetallic antenna--reactor system with palladium satellites attached to a gold nanoparticle. After pulsed excitation of the gold core, the satellites collect nearly all photothermal energy and heat up by 180\,K while the light-absorbing gold core remains much colder. By comparing transient absorption dynamics of a series of bimetallic nanoparticles with a three-temperature model, we can precisely assess the temperatures of the electronic and vibrational subsystems. We find a strong inverted temperature gradient that opposes the direction of energy input and concentrates the light energy at the active catalytic nanosite.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a biaxial nematogenic lattice model: A Monte Carlo simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase diagram for a lattice system of biaxial molecules possessing $D_{2h}$ symmetry and interacting with Straley's quadrupolar pair potential in Sonnet-Virga-Durand parameterization [A. M. Sonnet, E. G. Virga, and G. E. Durand, Phys. Rev. E {\bf67}, 061701 (2003)] has been determined using Monte Carlo simulation. Our results confirm that the nematogenic model yields both the uniaxial and biaxial nematic macroscopic phases along with a tricritical point in the transition from uniaxial to biaxial nematics as predicted in mean field theory. By analyzing the behavior of a free-energy-like function, derived from the probability distributions of energy, the order of phase transitions is detected. A conclusive numerical evidence in support of the existence of a tricritical point on the uniaxial-biaxial transition line in the phase diagram is reported. Although the nature of the phase diagram is qualitatively identical as obtained in the mean-field study however the location of the triple point differs significantly from theoretical prediction.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical self-assembly for high-yield addressable complexity at fixed conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is evidence that the self-assembly of complex molecular systems often proceeds hierarchically, by first building subunits that later assemble in larger entities, in a process that can repeat multiple times. Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon and its performance is limited. Here we introduce a simple model for hierarchical addressable self-assembly, where interactions between particles can be optimised to maximise the fraction of a well-formed target structure, or yield. We find that a hierarchical strategy leads to an impressive yield up to at least five generations of the hierarchy, and does not require a cycle of temperatures as used in previous methods. High yield is obtained when the microscopic interaction decreases with the scale of units considered, such that the total interaction between intermediate structures remains identical at all scales. We provide thermodynamic and dynamical arguments constraining the interaction strengths where this strategy is effective. Overall, our work characterizes an alternative strategy for addressable self-assembly at a fixed temperature, and provides insight into the mechanisms sustaining hierarchical assembly in biology.</description>

      <title>Slow modulation of the contraction patterns in Physarum polycephalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physarum polycephalum, a biological transport network, has emerged as a model for the study of self-organisation and coordination at large spatial scales. This self-organisation is largely due to cytoplasmic fluid flows driven by propagating contractile waves that are delocalised over the entire organism. Furthermore, complex modulation of these contractile waves on long time scales has also been observed, but is scarcely studied. In this study, we comprehensively characterise this long-time scale modulation by confining the organism within ring geometries.Our findings reveal a clear correlation between contractile wave direction, amplitude modulation, and the moving mean vein diameter. We observe simultaneous spatio-temporal travelling and standing wave patterns that bear a resemblance to the ring oscillating fundamental modes. Furthermore, we ascertain that the time periods of these modes scale with the system size and correspond to multiples of the statistically observed intrinsic modulation time scale. This suggests the presence of a common mechanism. These findings serve to reinforce the hypothesis that the flows patterns modulation is the result of the transport of a chemical agent responsible for modifying the local rigidity of the membrane, which would act as a signaling mechanism for the organism.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Oxidative Aging of Polymers under Various O2 Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of polymer oxidative aging has been actively studied since the 1990s. Insights from these studies suggest that the transport of oxygen and radicals significantly influences aging heterogeneity, alongside chemical reaction kinetics. A recent simulation study [Ishida et al., Macromolecules, 56(21), 8474-8483, 2023] demonstrated that mesoscale heterogeneity arises when the H-abstraction reaction occurs faster than the relaxation times of polymer chains. In this study, the simulations were extended by modeling the rate of oxygen addition to polymer radicals (k_2) to reflect the effects of the O2 concentration. Three key aspects of oxidative aging behavior were found to be influenced by the O2 addition rate: (i) reaction kinetics, (ii) the degree of heterogeneity, and (iii) amount of crosslinking. Namely, reducing O2 concentration slows the conversion of polymer radicals into H-abstractable peroxyl radicals. This deceleration delays H-abstraction reactions, increases the number of polymer radicals, and promotes crosslinking reactions between two polymer radicals.</description>

      <title>Application of $J$-Integral to a Random Elastic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of the $J$-integral to compute the statistics of the energy release rate of a random elastic medium. The spatial variability of the elastic modulus is modeled as a homogeneous lognormal random field. Within the framework of Monte Carlo simulation, a modified contour integral is applied to evaluate the first and second statistical moments of the energy release rate. These results are compared with the energy release rate calculated from the potential energy function. The comparison shows that, if the random field of elastic modulus is homogeneous in space, the path independence of the classical $J$-integral remains valid for calculating the mean energy release rate. However, this path independence does not extend to the higher order statistical moments. The simulation further reveals the effect of the correlation length of the spatially varying elastic modulus on the energy release rate of the specimen.</description>

      <title>MinD the gap: Membrane proteins form 3D patterns in a suspension of liposomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-organization of pattern-forming systems depends not only on the chemical but also physical properties of their components. In this work, we fragmented and dispersed the MinDE protein system's lipid substrate into diffusive sub-micrometer-sized liposomes, and report that the ATP-fueled protein-protein interactions continue to drive spatially extended patterns at scales well separated from those of the requisite liposomes, despite the complete loss of membrane continuity. The patterns form in three-dimensions because the membrane is dispersed in a volume. By varying protein concentration, liposome size distribution, and density, we observed and characterized rich 3D dynamical patterns at steady state, including traveling waves, dynamical spirals and a mixed phase where both patterns coexist. Simulations and linear stability analysis of a coarse-grained model reveal that the dispersed membranes's physical properties effectively rescale two key factors that govern pattern formation and wavelength selection: protein-membrane binding rates and diffusion. This work highlights the robustness of pattern formation in membrane-bulk systems despite membrane fragmentation. It suggests that biological protein systems have the potential to serve as adaptable templates for out-of-equilibrium self-organization in 3D, beyond in vivo biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Anti-counterfeiting tags with camouflaged QR codes on nanocavities, using polymer-dispersed-liquid-crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfeiting poses an evergrowing challenge, driving the need for innovative and sophisticated anti-counterfeiting strategies and technologies. Many solutions focus on tags characterized by optical features that are partially or completely camouflaged to the human eye, thus discouraging scammers. In this paper, a QR code is laser printed on a thin plastic foil previously coated by a specific nanocavity consisting of a metal/insulator/metal/insulator (MIMI) multilayer. This metamaterial possesses unique features in terms of light transmission that are due to the specific design. A thin layer of polymer dispersed liquid crystals, fabricated incorporating specific nematic liquid crystals in a polymer matrix, is able to camouflage the QR code that becomes, then, readable only under specific thermal conditions. Three anti-counterfeiting tags were fabricated, each using a distinct LC with its own nematic-isotropic transition temperature. The peculiar combination of the unique optical properties of nematic liquid crystals and optical nanocavities results in the creation of a novel type of tags showing two different encoding levels. Stress tests including water immersion, bending test, and prolonged heating have been performed ensuring the long-term stability of the tags. The realized two security-level anti-counterfeiting tags are cost-effective, straightforward to manufacture and, thanks to their flexibility, can be easily integrated into packaging and products.</description>

      <title>Viscotaxis of chiral microswimmer in viscosity gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microswimmers display an intriguing ability to navigate through fluids with spatially varying viscosity, a behavior known as viscotaxis, which plays a crucial role in guiding their motion. In this study, we reveal that the orientation dynamics of chiral squirmers in fluids with uniform viscosity gradients can be elegantly captured using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations, originally developed for spin systems. Remarkably, we discover that chiral swimmers demonstrate negative viscotaxis, tracing spiral trajectories as they move. Specifically, a chiral squirmer with a misaligned source dipole and rotlet dipole exhibits a steady-state spiral motion-a stark contrast to the linear behavior observed when the dipoles are aligned. This work provides fresh insights into the intricate interplay between microswimmer dynamics and fluid properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral active fluids can exhibit odd viscosity, a property that breaks the time-reversal and parity symmetries. Here, we examine the hydrodynamic flows of a rigid disk moving in a compressible 2D fluid layer with odd viscosity, supported by a thin lubrication layer of a conventional fluid. Using the 2D Green's function in Fourier space, we derive an exact analytical solution for the flow around a disk of arbitrary size, as well as its resistance matrix. The resulting resistance coefficients break the Onsager reciprocity, but satisfy the Onsager-Casimir reciprocity to any order in odd viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Effective and efficient modeling of the hydrodynamics for bacterial flagella</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions among bacterial cell bodies, flagella, and surrounding boundaries are essential for understanding bacterial motility in complex environments. In this study, we demonstrate that each slender flagellum can be modeled as a series of spheres, and that the interactions between these spheres can be accurately characterized using a resistance matrix. This approach allows us to effectively and efficiently evaluate the propulsive effects of the flagella. Notably, our investigation into bacterial motility near a colloidal sphere reveals significant discrepancies between results derived from the twin multipole moment and those obtained through resistive force theory. Consequently, neglecting the hydrodynamic interactions among cell bodies, flagella, and colloidal spheres may lead to substantial inaccuracies. Our model simplifies bacteria into a series of spheres, making it well-suited for examining bacterial motility near spherical boundaries, as well as the nonlinear deformation dynamics of elastic flagella.</description>

      <title>On inequalities of shear modulus contributions in disordered elastic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate generic inequalities of various contributions to the shear modulus $\mu$ in ensembles of amorphous elastic bodies. We focus first on a simple elastic network model with connectivity matrices (CMs) which are either annealed or quenched, at or out of equilibrium. The stress-fluctuation formalism relation for $\mu$ is rewritten as $\mu = \mu_1 + \mu_a$ with $\mu_1 \ge 0$ characterizing the variance of the quenched shear stresses and $\mu_a$ being a simple average over all states and CMs. For equilibrium CM-distributions $\mu_a$ becomes equivalent to the shear modulus of annealed systems, i.e. $\mu_a \ge 0$, while more generally $\mu_a$ may become strongly negative as shown by considering a temperature quench and a scalar active two-temperature model. Consistent relations are also found for glass-forming colloids where $\mu-\mu_1=\mu_a=0$ for equilibrium ensembles, i.e. $\mu$ is set by the quenched shear stresses, while $\mu_a$ becomes again negative otherwise.</description>

      <title>The orientational structure of a model patchy particle fluid: simulations, integral equations, density functional theory and machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern--Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.</description>

      <title>Insights into Transient Dynamics of Bacteria Laden Liquid Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study evaporation and precipitate formation mechanics of bacteria-laden liquid bridge using experimental and theoretical analysis. Aqueous suspension of motile and non-motile Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa typically found in contaminated food and water were used in liquid bridge configuration between hydrophilic substrates. Using inverse logarithmic evaporation flux model, we study volume regression for cylindrical/catenoid volume models with confinement distance as a parameter. For all confinement distances, the regression is linear on normalizing both volume and time as in the case of pure sessile drop. However, in normalized volume and dimensional time space, we observe non-linearities as the evaporation time scales non linearly with the confinement distance. The non-linearities were captured using the catenoid model. The catenoid model conforms to the experimental volume regression data at all confinement distances, and the transient liquid bridge interface evolution profile at high confinement distance. We also study the precipitate pattern and bacterial distribution using micro/nano characterization techniques. We show the average precipitate pattern for both sessile and higher confinement distance resembles coffee ring type deposits although the underlying bacterial distribution differs. For lower confinement, we observe pattern resulting from a combination of coffee ring effect, stick-slick motion, and thin film instability. The reduction in confinement distance causes an altered bacterial agglomeration, resulting in a multi-pattern network instead of a single circumferential edge deposition. We show the aerial size of motile bacteria increases with decreasing confinement, whereas the size for non-motile bacteria remains constant in the precipitate.</description>

Abstract: "Pasta alla Cacio e pepe" is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio and pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the "Mozzarella Phase" and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.</description>

      <title>Polarised crowd in motion: insights into statistical and dynamical behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collection of active agents often exhibits intriguing statistical and dynamical properties, particularly when considering human crowds. In this study, we have developed a computational model to simulate the recent experiment on real marathon races by Bain et al. Our primary goal is to investigate the impact of race staff on crowd dynamics. By comparing simulated races with and without the presence of race staff, our study reveals that the local velocity and density of participants display a wave pattern akin to real races for both the cases. The observed traveling wave in the crowd consistently propagates at a constant speed, regardless of the system size under consideration. The participants dynamics in the longitudinal direction primarily contribute to velocity fluctuations, while fluctuations in the transverse direction are suppressed. In the absence of race staff, density and velocity fluctuations weaken without significantly affecting other statistical and dynamic characteristics of the crowd. Through this research, we aim to deepen our understanding of crowd motion, providing insights that can inform the development of effective crowd management strategies and contribute to the successful control of such events.</description>

      <title>Hyperballistic transport in dense systems of charged particles under ac electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Langevin equation is ubiquitously employed to numerically simulate plasmas, colloids and electrolytes. However, the usual assumption of white noise becomes untenable when the system is subject to an external AC electric field. This is because the charged particles in the system, which provide the thermal bath for the particle transport, become themselves responsive to the AC field and the thermal noise is field-dependent and non-Markovian. We theoretically study the particle diffusivity in a Langevin transport model for a tagged charged particle immersed in a dense system of charged particles (plus also, possibly, other neutral particles) that act as the thermal bath, under an external AC electric field. This is done by properly accounting for the effects of the AC field on the thermal bath statistics. We analytically derive the time-dependent generalized diffusivity $D(t)$ for different initial conditions. The generalized diffusivity exhibits damped oscillatory-like behaviour with initial very large peaks, where the generalized diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the infinite-time steady-state value. The latter coincides with the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity in the absence of external field. For initial conditions where the external field is already on at $t=0$ and the system is thermalized under DC conditions for $t \leq 0$, the short-time behaviour is hyperballistic, $MSD \sim t^4$ (where MSD is the mean-squared displacement), leading to giant enhancement of the particle transport. Finally, the theory elucidates the role of medium polarization on the local Lorentz field, and allows for estimates of the effective electric charge due to polarization by the surrounding charges.</description>
