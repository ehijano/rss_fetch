      <title>Dependence Structure and Epidemic Outcomes in Heterogeneous SIR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a well mixed SIR epidemic model with heterogeneous susceptibility and infectivity, allowing for an arbitrary joint distribution of these traits. Using an exact final size formulation and a branching process approximation for early epidemic dynamics, we show that both the final epidemic size and the probability of a major outbreak are monotone with respect to the concordance order of the joint susceptibility infectivity distribution. In particular, among all couplings with fixed marginal trait distributions, comonotonic dependence maximizes epidemic severity, yielding sharp distribution free upper bounds. A key implication is that epidemic outcomes cannot be ordered by susceptibility heterogeneity alone: while increasing susceptibility variance reduces the final size under independence, positive dependence between susceptibility and infectivity can locally increase epidemic size for any basic reproduction number exceeding one. We further show that neither susceptibility variance nor the sign of the covariance suffices to determine epidemic severity under dependence. These findings offer new insights into epidemic risk assessment under limited information.</description>

      <title>Mapping the landscape of mathematical models for antimicrobial resistance: a scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global public health problem, contributing to an estimated 4.95 million deaths in 2019 and projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually and 100 trillion dollars in cumulative economic losses by 2050. Its emergence and spread result from complex biological, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions. Mathematical modelling is a key tool to study AMR dynamics, yet the literature remains fragmented and methodologically limited. This review synthesizes recent mathematical modelling studies to identify trends, biases, and research gaps. Methods: A scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines was conducted. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for studies published between 2019 and 2024 that developed mathematical models of AMR. After screening and duplicate removal, 36 studies were included. Data were extracted using a structured framework covering model context, construction and parameters, and outputs and validation. Results: Most studies relied on deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and focused on bacterial resistance in human hosts, with only one adopting a One Health perspective. Conjugation and mutation were the most commonly modelled resistance mechanisms, whereas transduction, transformation, host immunity, spatial heterogeneity, and environmental components were rarely included. Few studies incorporated economic impacts, and a strong geographic bias toward high-income countries was observed. Conclusion: Mathematical modelling of AMR is an active field but characterized by limited methodological diversity. While deterministic ODE models have advanced understanding of AMR dynamics, future work should integrate stochasticity, spatial structure, ecological interactions, and One Health perspectives, as well as economic and social variables, to inform global strategies to mitigate AMR.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory evolutionarily stable state and limit cycle in replicator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of evolutionarily stable state (ESS) of a population is a cornerstone of evolutionary game theory; moreover, it coincides with the game-theoretic concept of Nash equilibrium. Such a state corresponds to a strategy adopted by the population such that a rare mutant strategy cannot invade the population. In parallel, the dynamical formulation of evolutionary game theory -- particularly through replicator dynamics embodying the tenet of survival of the fittest -- provides a framework for modelling frequency-dependent selection over time. While it is well known that an ESS corresponds to stable fixed point in replicator dynamics, the evolutionary game-theoretic characterization of limit cycles is unknown. Here we fill this lacuna by defining oscillatory ESS (OESS) which we prove to be a stable limit cycle. We also show when an OESS is unique and if there are multiple OESSes, then what their locations are in the phase space.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic expressions for steady-state distribution and static responses in population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions in population dynamics is how biological populations respond to environmental perturbations. In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.</description>

      <title>Life as a Categorical Information-Handling System: An Evolutionary Information-Theoretic Model of the Holobiont</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems can be understood as organized entities that capture, transform, and reproduce information. Classical gene-centered models explain adaptation through frequency changes driven by differential fitness, yet they often overlook the higher-order organization and causal closure that characterize living systems. Here we revisit several evolutionary frameworks, from the replicator equation to group selection and holobiont dynamics, and show that evolutionary change in population frequencies can be expressed as a Jeffreys divergence. Building on this foundation, we introduce a categorical model of Information Handlers (IH), entities capable of self-maintenance, mutation, and combination. This abstract architecture illustrates the usefulness of category theory for framing evolutionary processes that range from very simple to highly complex. The same categorical scheme can represent basic allele-frequency change as well as more elaborate scenarios involving reproductive interactions, symbiosis, and other organizational layers. A key feature of the framework is that different levels of evolutionary change can be summarized through a measure that quantifies the information generated, thereby distinguishing diverse types of evolutionary transformation such as individual and sexual selection, mate choice, or even holobiont selection. Finally, we show that the informational partition associated with host-microbiome pairings in holobionts generalizes the information-theoretic structure previously developed for non-random mating, revealing a common underlying architecture across biological scales.</description>

      <title>Modelling the emergence of open-ended cultural evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and cumulatively change their culture in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between cultural systems (a society's repertoire of interdependent techniques, artifacts, norms and knowledge) and search spaces (an ensemble of needs, problems and goals facing a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both cultural systems and search spaces are subject to evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when cultural systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective cultural systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended cultural evolution.</description>
