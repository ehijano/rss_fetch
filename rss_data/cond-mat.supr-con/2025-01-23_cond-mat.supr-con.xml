      <title>Eliashberg Theory and Superfluid Stiffness of Band-Off-Diagonal Pairing in Twisted Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, band-off-diagonal superconductivity has been proposed [Nat. Commun. 14, 7134 (2023)] as a candidate pairing state for twisted graphene systems. Based on mean-field theory, it was shown that it not only naturally emerges from both intervalley electron-phonon coupling and fluctuations of the nearby correlated insulator, but also exhibits nodal and gapped regimes as indicated by scanning tunneling microscopy experiments. Here we study band-off-diagonal pairing within Eliashberg theory. We show that despite the additional frequency dependence, the leading-order description of both intervalley coherent fluctuations or intervalley phonons exhibits a symmetry prohibiting admixture of an intraband component to the interband pairing state. It is found that even- and odd-frequency pairing mix, which originates from the reduced number of flavor degrees of freedom in the normal state. From analytic continuation, we obtain the electronic spectral function showing that, also within Eliashberg theory, the interband nature leads to an enhanced spectral weight below the order-parameter energy compared to band-diagonal pairing. Finally, we also study the superfluid stiffness of band-off-diagonal pairing, taking into account multi-band and quantum geometry effects. It is shown that for $s$-wave and chiral momentum dependencies, conventionally leading to fully gapped phases, an interband structure reduces the temperature scale below which the stiffness saturates. Depending on parameters, for the chiral state, this scale can even be suppressed all the way to zero temperature leading to a complex competition of multiple dispersive and geometrical contributions. Our results show that interband pairing might also be able to explain more recent stiffness measurements in the superconducting state of twisted multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Current-induced magnetoresistance hysteresis in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of current-modulated magnetoresistance hysteresis below the superconducting transition temperature in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This highly tunable hysteresis behavior is confined to the superconducting state and vanishes when superconductivity is fully suppressed, directly linking magnetoresistance hysteresis to the superconducting order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Additionally, the superconducting diode effect driven by a small magnetic field is observed, indicating the enhanced electronic magnetochiral anisotropy by the chiral domain-wall scattering. Our findings position CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a promising platform for exploring nontrivial physical phenomena, including unconventional pairing mechanisms and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Absence of superconductivity and density-wave transition in ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under high pressure stimulates intensive research interests. These nickelates crystallize in an orthogonal/monoclinic structure with tilted NiO$_6$ octahedra at ambient pressure and enter a density-wave-like phase at low temperatures. The application of pressure suppresses the octahedral tilting and triggers a transition to tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), which is believed to be a key prerequisite for the emergence of superconducting state. Here, by developing a high oxidative environment growth technology, we report the first tetragonal nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ microcrystals without octahedral tilting at ambient pressure. In tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, transport measurements find that both density-wave and superconducting transitions are absent up to 160 GPa, indicating a robust tetragonal metallic ground state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the band structure of ambient-pressure tetragonal La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ involves more $d_{z2}$ orbital contribution to the Fermi surface, compared to the monoclinic phase or the high-pressure superconducting tetragonal phase. The concurrent absence of density-wave state and high-pressure superconductivity in our ambient-pressure tetragonal crystals of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ suggests an underlying correlation between these two orders. It suggests that the tetragonal structure is not necessary, while the density-wave state is crucial for the superconductivity in nickelates. Our findings impose important constraints on the mechanism of pressure-induced superconductivity in nickelates and sheds new light on exploring ambient pressure high-temperature Ni-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of $s_{\pm}-to-s_{++}$ transition in iron pnictides in the vicinity of the Born limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study thermodynamical properties of the disorder-induced transition between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ superconducting gap functions, we calculate the grand thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ in the normal and the superconducting states. Expression for the difference between the two, $\Delta\Omega$, is derived for a two-band model for Fe-based systems with nonmagnetic impurities. The disorder is considered in a $\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation within the multiband Eliashberg theory. In the vicinity of the Born limit near the $s_{\pm}$-to-$s_{++}$ transition, we find two solutions obtained for opposite directions of the system's evolution with respect to the impurity scattering rate. By calculating the change in entropy $\Delta S$ and the change in electronic specific heat $\Delta C$ from $\Delta\Omega$, we show that such a hysteresis is not due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking state, but it rather points out to the first order phase transition induced by the nonmagnetic disorder. Based on the $\Delta\Omega$ calculations, phase diagram is plotted representing the energetically favourable $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states and the transition between them. At finite temperature, a first order phase transition line there is limited by a critical end point. Above that point, the sharp $s_{\pm} \to s_{++}$ transition transforms to a crossover between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phase diagram of cuprates and universal scaling laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider the magnetic field phase diagram of hole-doped high-$T_c$ cuprates, which has been given much less attention than the temperature diagram. In the framework of the {\it pairon model}, we show that the two characteristic energies, the pair binding energy (the gap $\Delta_p$) and the condensation energy ($\beta_c$) resulting from pair correlations, give rise to two major magnetic fields, the upper critical field $B_{c2}$ and a second field, $B_{pg}$, associated with the pseudogap (PG). The latter implies a second length scale in addition to the coherence length, characteristic of incoherent pairs. Universal scaling laws for both $B_{c2}$ and $B_{pg}$ are derived: $B_{c2}$ scales with the critical temperature, $B_{c2}/T_c\simeq 1.65$ T/K, in agreement with many experiments, and $B_{pg}$ has a similar scaling with respect to $T^*$. Finally, Fermi arcs centered on the nodal directions are predicted to appear as a function of magnetic field, an effect testable experimentally.</description>

      <title>The BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation with external magnetic field and the first-order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deal with a type I superconductor in a constant external magnetic field. We obtain the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation with external magnetic field and apply the implicit function theorem to it. We show that there is a unique magnetic field (the critical magnetic field) given by a smooth function of the temperature and that there is also a unique nonnegative solution (the gap function) given by a smooth function of both the temperature and the external magnetic field. Using the grand potential, we show that the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in a type I superconductor is of the first order. Moreover we obtain the explicit expression for the entropy gap.</description>

      <title>Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor/Quantum Hall Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a Chern insulator in the integer quantum Hall (QH) regime. Our results show that the effective interaction at this boundary gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons at the SC/QH interface. These fields couple to a gauge field that includes both Chern-Simons term, originating from the QH sector, and Maxwell term. Using this framework, we investigate the effects of magnetic flux vortices on the SC/QH interface. The emergence of the Chern-Simons term significantly modifies the magnetic penetration depth, influencing the Abrikosov lattice period and potentially altering the superconducting behavior at the interface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vortex solutions at the interface carry a fractional charge of $e/2$, which reflects the ratio between the effective Chern-Simons level parameter and the charge of the Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superconducting pairing due to multiple Majorana edge modes in driven topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have been shown to be the simplest quasiparticles exhibiting pure odd-frequency pairing, an effect that has so far been theoretically established in the static regime. In this work, we investigate the formation of Majorana modes and odd-frequency pairing in $p$-wave spin-polarized superconductors under a time-dependent drive. We first show that the driven system hosts multiple Majorana modes emerging at zero and $\pi$, whose formation can be controlled by an appropriate tuning of the drive frequency and chemical potential, in agreement with previous studies. Then we explore the induced pair correlations and find that odd-frequency spin-polarized $s$-wave pairing is broadly induced, acquiring large values in the presence of Majorana modes. We discover that, while odd-frequency pairing is proportional to $\sim1/\omega$ in the presence of Majorana zero modes, it is proportional to $\sim 1/(\omega-\pi\hbar/T)$ in the presence of Majorana $\pi$ modes, where $T$ is the periodicity of the drive. Furthermore, we find that the amount of odd-frequency pairing becomes larger when multiple Majorana modes appear but the overall divergent profile as a function of frequency remains. We also show that the divergent odd-frequency pairing is robust against scalar disorder. Notably, we establish a spectral bulk-boundary correspondence between the amount of boundary odd-$\omega$ pairing and the bulk topological invariants in driven chiral systems, which we show to be protected by chiral symmetry and is thus robust against disorder. Our work thus paves the way for understanding the emergent pair correlations in driven topological superconductors</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infinite-layer nickelates, proposed as analogs to superconducting cuprates, provide a promising platform for exploring the mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity. However, the superconductivity under atmospheric pressure has only been observed in thin films, indicating the heterointerface is essential. Here, we employed the advanced Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy-Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) technique to thoroughly investigate the atomic configuration, layer-resolved electronic states and phonon across the NdNiO2/SrTiO3 interface. We found the Sr atoms diffusion at the interface, which results in hole doping into oxygen and nickel band to form a p-type interface. A pronounced redshift of the highest-energy optical phonon (HEOP) of NdNiO2 (~78 meV) is observed at the interface, which is primarily attributed to the epitaxial strain. Our work clarifies that the effects of the interface on electron and phonon states are mainly due to elemental intermixing and epitaxial strain, which could lay the foundation for future investigations into superconducting mechanisms of infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev honeycomb model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We microscopically construct an abelian mutual Chern-Simons lattice gauge theory for magnetic field-tuned topological transitions in the Kitaev model and obtain a complete characterization of the phases, including their quasiparticles. At low fields for both ferro and antiferromagnetic (FM(AFM)) Kitaev interactions, we demonstrate nonabelian Ising topological order (ITO), and explicitly construct the Majorana anyon as an intrinsic excitation -- a twist defect in our \textit{abelian} gauge theory. For the AFM case, an abelian chiral phase appears at intermediate fields with trivial topological order and fermionic bulk excitations. Remarkably, both the ITO phase and the intermediate phase have the same chiral central charge $c=1/2,$ implying no change in the quantized thermal Hall response across the transition. For the FM case, there is a direct transition from ITO to a partially polarized nontopological phase. Our study completes the proof of Kitaev's original proposal of the low-field ITO with $c=1/2$ going beyond his mean-field arguments by including the crucial effect of the gauge fluctuations, and provides a resolution of the debate surrounding the intermediate field phase in the AFM case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity is non-linear, it is difficult to study superconducting properties analytically. There is a more tractable linear criterion which determines a temperature $T_l$ below which the system is superconducting. Here, we observe that there is a similar linear criterion which gives a temperature $T_u$ above which no superconductivity occurs. We provide examples of translation invariant systems where $T_u&gt;T_l$ as well as systems where $T_u=T_l$. Furthermore, we estimate $T_u$ for half-spaces and show that it is exponentially small in the weak coupling limit, exhibiting the same asymptotics as the critical temperature for full space.</description>
