      <title>Spin-selective coherent light scattering from ion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study collective light scattering from linear crystals with up to twelve $^{40}\text{Ca}^+$ ions, acting as coherent single photon emitters. Light-scattering is induced by two-photon laser excitation, starting from the S$_{1/2}$ to D$_{5/2}$ quadrupole transition at 729~nm in combination with laser excitation of the D$_{5/2}$ to P$_{3/2}$ dipole transition at 854~nm, followed by a decay back to S$_{1/2}$ via a single photon emission near 393~nm. The scattered intensity is recorded in the far field, featuring the interference of emitted light fields of the entire crystal. Furthermore, we demonstrate spin-dependent coherent scattering and unveil the time evolution of a previously encoded spin texture in a crystal employing the recorded dynamics of the spatial frequency components of the fringe pattern.</description>

      <title>Photoexcitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition using twisted light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{229}$Th nucleus has a unique transition at only 8 eV which could be used for a novel nuclear clock. We investigate theoretically the prospects of driving this transition with vortex light beams carrying orbital angular momentum. Numerical results are presented for two experimental configurations which are promising for the design of the planned nuclear clock: a trapped ion setup and a large ensemble of nuclei doped into CaF$_2$ crystals which are transparent in the frequency range of the nuclear transition. We discuss the feasibility of the vortex beam nuclear excitation and compare the excitation features with the case of plane wave beams.</description>

      <title>Effective light-induced Hamiltonian for atoms with large nuclear spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cold fermionic atoms, having two valence electrons, exhibit a distinctive internal state structure, wherein the nuclear spin becomes decoupled from the electronic degrees of freedom in the ground electronic state. Consequently, the nuclear spin states are well isolated from the environment, rendering these atomic systems an opportune platform for quantum computation and quantum simulations. Coupling with off-resonance light is an essential tool to selectively and coherently manipulate the nuclear spin states. In this paper, we present a systematic derivation of the effective Hamiltonian for the nuclear spin states of ultra-cold fermionic atoms due to such an off-resonance light. We obtain compact expressions for the scalar, vector and tensor light shifts taking into account both linear and quadratic contributions to the hyperfine splitting. The analysis has been carried out using the Green operator approach and solving the corresponding Dyson equation. Finally, we analyze different scenarios of light configurations which lead to the vector- and tensor-light shifts, as well as the pure spin-orbit coupling for the nuclear spin.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transition in a large interacting driven atomic ensemble in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic ensembles strongly interacting with light constitute rich quantum-optical many-body systems, with the potential for observing cooperative effects and dissipative nonequilibrium phase transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which a driven atomic ensemble in free space, characterized by strong dipole-dipole interactions and large spatial extent, can undergo a superradiant phase transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence. In an atomic array, stationary states that conserve the collective pseudospin exhibit completely cooperative decay and undergo a second-order phase transition in the large atom number limit. In contrast, decay mechanisms on longer timescales that fail to conserve pseudospin can lead to discontinuous first-order phase transition at a critical finite atom number, disrupting cooperation despite sharing many similar observable characteristics. A hallmark of the superradiant phase transition is an abrupt shift from total light reflection off the atoms to rapidly increasing transmission, accompanied by significant quantum fluctuations, as a function of light intensity.</description>

Abstract: An update is given on the experimental values of the magnetic hyperfine structure and the Bohr-Weisskopf effect in muonic atoms. The need for more measurements and systematic calculations is discussed to allow the differentiation of different models of the Bohr-Weisskopf effect in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor in degenerate topological semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the complete geometric properties of quantum states, with the symmetric part being the quantum metric, and the antisymmetric part being the Berry curvature. We propose a generic Hamiltonian with global degenerate ground states, and give a general relation between the corresponding non-Abelian quantum metric and unit Bloch vector. This enables us to construct the relation between the non-Abelian quantum metric and Berry or Euler curvature. To be concrete, we present and study two topological semimetal models with global degenerate bands under CP and $C_2T$ symmetries, respectively. The topological invariants of these two degenerate topological semimetals are the Chern number and Euler class, respectively, which are calculated from the non-Abelian quantum metric with our constructed relations. Based on the adiabatic perturbation theory, we further obtain the relation between the non-Abelian quantum metric and the energy fluctuation. Such a non-adiabatic effect can be used to extract the non-Abelian quantum metric, which is numerically demonstrated for the two models of degenerate topological semimetals. Finally, we discuss the quantum simulation of the model Hamiltonians with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Robust atom-photon gate for quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for two-qubit gates between a flying photon and an atom in a cavity. The atom-photon gate setup consists of a cavity and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with doubly degenerate ground and excited state energy levels mediating the atom-light interaction. We provide an error analysis of the gate and model important errors, including spatial mode mismatch between the photon and the cavity, spontaneous emission, cavity losses, detunings, and random fluctuations of the cavity parameters and frequencies. Error analysis shows that the gate protocol is more robust against experimental errors compared to previous atom-photon gates and achieves higher fidelity.</description>
