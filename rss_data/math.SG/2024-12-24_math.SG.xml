      <title>Generalizing symplectic topology from 1 to 2 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In symplectic topology one uses elliptic methods to prove rigidity results about symplectic manifolds and solutions of Hamiltonian equations on them, where the most basic example is given by geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. Harmonic maps from surfaces are the natural 2-dimensional generalizations of geodesics. In this paper, we give the corresponding generalization of symplectic manifolds and Hamiltonian equations, leading to a class of partial differential equations that share properties similar to Hamiltonian (ordinary) differential equations. Two rigidity results are discussed: a non-squeezing theorem and a version of the cuplength result for quadratic Hamiltonians on cotangent bundles. The proof of the latter uses a generalization of Floer curves, for which the necessary Fredholm and compactness results will be proven.</description>

      <title>On the spectral flow theorem of Robbin-Salamon for finite intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider operators of the form $\partial_s\xi+A(s)\xi$ where $s$ lies in an interval $[-T,T]$ and $s\mapsto A(s)$ is continuous. Without boundary conditions these operators are not Fredholm. However, using interpolation theory one can define suitable boundary conditions for these operators so that they become Fredholm. We show that in this case the Fredholm index is given by the spectral flow of the operator path $A$.</description>

      <title>Dirac products and concurring Dirac structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss in this note two dual canonical operations on Dirac structures $L$ and $R$ -- the \emph{tangent product} $L \star R$ and the \emph{cotangent product} $L \circledast R$. Our first result gives an explicit description of the leaves of $L \star R$ in terms of those of $L$ and $R$, surprisingly ruling out the pathologies which plague general ``induced Dirac structures''.
  In contrast to the tangent product, the more novel contangent product $L \circledast R$ need not be Dirac even if smooth. When it is, we say that $L$ and $R$ \emph{concur}.
  Concurrence captures commuting Poison structures, refines the \emph{Dirac pairs} of Dorfman and Kosmann-Schwarzbach, and it is our proposal as the natural notion of ``compatibility'' between Dirac structures.
  The rest of the paper is devoted to illustrating the usefulness of tangent- and cotangent products in general, and the notion of concurrence in particular. Dirac products clarify old constructions in Poisson geometry, characterize Dirac structures which can be pushed forward by a smooth map, and mandate a version of a local normal form. Magri and Morosi's $P\Omega$-condition and Vaisman's notion of two-forms complementary to a Poisson structures are found to be instances of concurrence, as is the setting for the Frobenius-Nirenberg theorem. We conclude the paper with an interpretation in the style of Magri and Morosi of generalized complex structures which concur with their conjugates.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangian Tori in $S^2\times S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [FOOO12], K. Fukaya, Y. Oh, H. Ohta, and K. Ono (FOOO) obtained the monotone symplectic manifold $S^2\times S^2$ by resolving the singularity of a toric degeneration of a Hirzebruch surface. They identified a continuum of toric fibers in the resolved toric degeneration that are not Hamiltonian isotopic to the toric fibers of the standard toric structure on $S^2\times S^2$. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification: for any toric fiber in FOOO's construction of $S^2\times S^2$, we determine whether it is Hamiltonian isotopic to a toric fiber of the standard toric structure of $S^2\times S^2$.</description>

      <title>Bi-normal trajectories in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show there exist infinitely many trajectories which are bi-normal (i.e. normal at initial and final times) to the xz-plane, in the Spatial Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem, for energies below or slightly above the first critical value and near the primaries, under the assumption of the twist condition as defined by Moreno-van-Koert in arXiv:2011.06562. This is an application of the relative Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem for Lagrangians in Liouville domains, as proven by the authors in arXiv:2408.06919.</description>

      <title>Maximal symplectic torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several different notions of maximal torus actions on smooth manifolds, in various contexts: symplectic, Riemannian, complex. In the symplectic context, for the so-called isotropy-maximal actions, as well as for the weaker notion of almost isotropy-maximal actions, we give classifications up to equivariant symplectomorphism. These classification results give symplectic analogues of recent classifications in the complex and Riemannian contexts. Moreover, we deduce that every almost isotropy-maximal symplectic torus action is equivariantly diffeomorphic to a product of a symplectic toric manifold and a torus, answering a question of Ishida. The proof of the classification theorem involves tools from Duistermaat and Pelayo's classification of symplectic torus actions with coisotropic orbits.</description>

      <title>Half-form quantization of mixed toric polarizations and Hamiltonian flows in imaginary-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the half-form corrected geometric quantization of symplectic toric manifolds with respect to mixed toric polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{\infty}$. These polarizations are obtained at infinite geodesic time along Mabuchi rays of toric K\"ahler polarizations generated by the norm square of the moment map of a torus subgroup.
  The geodesic rays are lifted to the quantum bundle via generalized coherent state transforms (gCST) and define equivariant isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces for the K\"ahler polarizations and the Hilbert space for the mixed polarization.</description>

      <title>Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a K\"ahler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous K\"ahler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous K\"ahler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.</description>

      <title>Current algebras from QP-manifolds in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0100</link>
      <description>arXiv:1308.0100v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new unified formulation of the current algebra theory in general dimensions in terms of supergeometry. We take a QP-manifold, i.e. a differential graded (dg) symplectic manifold, as a fundamental framework. A Poisson bracket in a current algebra is constructed by the so called derived bracket of the graded Poisson structure induced from the above QP-structure. By taking a canonical transformation on a QP-manifold, correct anomalous terms in physical theories are derived. A large class of current algebras with and without anomalous terms (central extensions) are constructed from the above structure. Moreover, using this formulation, a new class of current algebras related higher structures are systematically obtained.</description>

      <title>Tight contact structures on toroidal plumbed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tight contact structures on plumbed 3-manifolds with no bad vertices. We discuss how one can count the number of tight contact structures with zero Giroux torsion on such 3-manifolds and explore conditions under which Giroux torsion can be added to these tight contact structures without making them overtwisted. We give an explicit algorithm to construct stein diagrams corresponding to tight structures without Giroux torsion. We focus mainly on plumbed 3-manifolds whose vertices have valence at most 3 and then briefly consider the situation for plumbed 3-manifolds with vertices of higher valence.</description>
