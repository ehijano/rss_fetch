      <title>On inequalities between norms of partial derivatives on convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inequalities between $L_p$-norms of partial derivatives, $p\in [1,+\infty]$, for bivariate concave functions on a convex domain that vanish on the boundary. Can the ratio between those norms be arbitrarily large? If not, what is the upper bound? We show that for $p=1$, the ratio is always bounded and find sharp estimates, while for $p&gt;1$, the answer depends on the geometry of the domain.</description>

      <title>Weighted minimum $\alpha$-Green energy problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $\alpha$-Green kernel $g^\alpha_D$ on a domain $D\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\geqslant2$, associated with the $\alpha$-Riesz kernel $|x-y|^{\alpha-n}$, where $\alpha\in(0,n)$ and $\alpha\leqslant2$, and a relatively closed set $F\subset D$, we investigate the problem on minimizing the Gauss functional \[\int g^\alpha_D(x,y)\,d(\mu\otimes\mu)(x,y)-2\int g^\alpha_D(x,y)\,d(\vartheta\otimes\mu)(x,y),\] $\vartheta$ being a given positive (Radon) measure concentrated on $D\setminus F$, and $\mu$ ranging over all probability measures of finite energy, supported in $D$ by $F$. For suitable $\vartheta$, we find necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the existence of the solution to the problem, give a description of its support, provide various alternative characterizations, and prove convergence theorems when $F$ is approximated by partially ordered families of sets. The analysis performed is substantially based on the perfectness of the $\alpha$-Green kernel, discovered by Fuglede and Zorii (Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn. Math., 2018).</description>

      <title>On the Palais-Smale condition in geometric knot theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that various families of energies relevant in
  geometric knot theory satisfy the Palais-Smale condition (PS)
  on submanifolds of arclength para\-metrized knots.
  These energies
  include linear combinations of the Euler-Bernoulli
  bending energy with a wide variety of non-local
  knot energies, such as
  O'Hara's self-repulsive potentials $E^{\alpha,p}$, generalized
  tangent-point energies $\TP^{(p,q)}$, and generalized integral
  Menger curvature functionals $\intM^{(p,q)}$. Even the
  tangent-point energies $\TP^{(p,2)}$ for $p\in (4,5)$ alone
  are shown to fulfill the (PS)-condition. For all energies mentioned
  we can therefore prove existence of minimizing knots in any prescribed
  ambient isotopy class, and we
  provide long-time existence of their Hilbert-gradient flows,
  and subconvergence to critical knots as time goes to infinity.
  In addition, we prove $C^\infty$-smoothness of all arclength constrained
  critical knots, which shows in particular that these critical knots
  are also critical for the energies on the larger open set of
  regular knots under a fixed-length constraint.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Schauder frames of exponentials and of uniformly bounded functions in $L^p$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there is no unconditional basis of exponentials in the space $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \ne 2$, for any set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of finite measure. This is a consequence of a more general result due to Gaposhkin, who proved that the space $L^p(\Omega)$ does not admit a seminormalized unconditional basis consisting of uniformly bounded functions. We show that the latter result fails if the word "basis" is replaced with "Schauder frame". On the other hand we prove that if $\Omega$ has nonempty interior then there are no unconditional Schauder frames of exponentials in the space $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \ne 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a technique for recovering a vector field and a symmetric $2$-tensor field, both real-valued and compactly supported in some strictly convex bounded domain with smooth boundary in the Euclidean plane, from the sum of their attenuated moment ray transforms. In addition, we provide a stability estimate for recovering both the vector field and the symmetric $2$-tensor field from the aforementioned ray transform.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin Spaces of Optimal Scale: Real-Variable Characterizations, Invariance on Integrable Index, and Sobolev-Type Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, using growth functions we introduce generalized matrix-weighted Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin-type spaces with matrix $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ weights. We first characterize these spaces, respectively, in terms of the $\varphi$-transform, the Peetre-type maximal function, and the Littlewood-Paley functions. Furthermore, after establishing the boundedness of almost diagonal operators on the corresponding sequence spaces, we obtain the molecular and the wavelet characterizations of these spaces. As applications, we find the sufficient and necessary conditions for the invariance of those Triebel-Lizorkin-type spaces on the integrable index and also for the Sobolev-type embedding of all these spaces. The main novelty exists in that these results are of wide generality, the growth condition of growth functions is not only sufficient but also necessary for the boundedness of almost diagonal operators and hence this new framework of Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin-type is optimal, some results either are new or improve the known ones even for known matrix-weighted Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, and, furthermore, even in the scalar-valued setting, all the results are also new.</description>

      <title>Spectral parameter power series for Zakharov-Shabat direct and inverse scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the Zakharov-Shabat system. Representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in the unit disk. The coefficients of the series are computed following a simple recurrent integration procedure. This essentially reduces the solution of the direct scattering problem to the computation of the coefficients and location of zeros of an analytic function inside of the unit disk. The solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of a system of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potential is recovered from the first coefficient. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Limit law for root separation in random polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f_n$ be a random polynomial of degree $n\ge 2$ whose coefficients are independent and identically distributed random variables. We study the separation distances between roots of $f_n$ and prove that the set of these distances, normalized by $n^{-5/4}$, converges in distribution as $n\to \infty$ to a non-homogeneous Poisson point process. As a corollary, we deduce that the minimal separation distance between roots of $f_n$, normalized by $n^{-5/4}$ has a non-trivial limit law. In the course of the proof, we establish a related result which may be of independent interest: a Taylor series with random i.i.d. coefficients almost-surely does not have a double zero anywhere other than the origin.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Second-Order and Curl-Free Field Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using techniques from harmonic analysis, we derive several sharp stability estimates for the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We also present the explicit lower and upper bounds for the sharp stability constants and compute their exact limits when the dimension $N\rightarrow\infty$. Our proofs rely on spherical harmonics decomposition and Fourier analysis, differing significantly from existing approaches in the literature. Our results substantially improve the stability constants of the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle recently obtained in [26]. As direct consequences of our main results, we also establish the sharp stability, with exact asymptotic behavior of the stability constants, of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with curl-free vector fields and a sharp version of the second order Poincar\'{e} type inequality with Gaussian measure.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of special function solutions of Painlev\'e III equation for fixed parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the small and large $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation in the complex plane. We use the representation in terms of Toeplitz determinants of Bessel functions obtained in arXiv:nlin/0302026. Toeplitz determinants are rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief's identity. The small and large $x$ asymptotics are obtained using elementary asymptotic methods applied to the multiple contour integral. The asymptotics is extended to the whole complex plane using analytic continuation formulas for Bessel functions. The claimed result has not appeared in the literature before. We note that Toeplitz determinant representation is useful for numerical computations of corresponding solutions of the Painlev\'e-III equation.</description>

      <title>Internality of autonomous algebraic differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is interested in internality to the constants of systems of autonomous algebraic ordinary differential equations. Roughly, this means determining when can all solutions of such a system be written as a rational function of finitely many fixed solutions (and their derivatives) and finitely many constants. If the system is a single order one equation, the answer was given in an old article of Rosenlicht. In the present work, we completely answer this question for a large class of systems. As a corollary, we obtain a necessary condition for the generic solution to be Liouvillian. We then apply these results to determine exactly when solutions to Poizat equations (a special case of Li\'enard equations) are internal, answering a question of Freitag, Jaoui, Marker and Nagloo, and to the classic Lotka-Volterra system, showing that its generic solutions are almost never Liouvillian.</description>

Abstract: We present a general framework of localized operators, i.e., operators whose matrix coefficients with respect to the Gabor frame are concentrated on the diagonal. We show that localized operators are bounded between modulation spaces, and we deduce their compactness from an easily verifiable weak compactness condition. We apply this abstract formalism to unify and extend existing theorems for pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators, and to obtain new results for three-parameter pseudodifferential operators.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Theory of Scalar Volterra Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between pure and applied research on scalar, linear Volterra equations by examining five major classes: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone kernels (viscoelastic models); equations with positive definite kernels (partially observed quantum systems); difference equations with discrete, positive definite kernels; a generalized class of delay differential equations; and a generalized class of fractional differential equations. We develop a general, spectral theory that provides a system of correspondences between these disparate domains. As a result, we see how `interconversion' (operator inversion) arises as a natural, continuous involution within each class, yielding a plethora of novel formulas for analytical solutions of such equations. This spectral theory unifies and extends existing results in viscoelasticity, signal processing, and analysis. It also introduces a geometric construction of the regularized Hilbert transform, revealing a fundamental connection to fractional and delay differential equations. Finally, it offers a practical toolbox for Volterra equations of all classes, reducing many to pen-and-paper calculations and introducing a powerful spectral approach for general Volterra equations based on rational approximation.</description>

      <title>Classes of functions in the set of circulant matrices and their characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new classes of functions that extend the known classes of functions of complex variable, such as entire functions, meromorphic functions, rational functions and polynomial functions and take values in the set of circulant matrices with complex entries. For these new classes of functions, we extend the recently obtained characterization theorems in [Li, B. Q. Two elementary properties of entire functions and their applications. Amer. Math. Monthly 122(2) (2015), 169--172] and [Li, B. Q. A characterization of rational functions. Amer. Math. Monthly. 132(3) (2025), 269--271] to an algebraic structure of circulant matrices that includes several complex variables. Our characterization theorems lead to the generalization of the variant of the fundamental theorem of algebra established recently in [Abramov, V. M. Extension of the fundamental theorem of algebra for polynomial matrix equation with circulant matrices. Amer. Math. Monthly. DOI: 10.1080/00029890.2024.2440298].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the asymptotic analysis for Laplace's integral. For this problem, the so-called Laplace's method by P.S. Laplace (1812) is well-known and it has been developed in various forms over many years of studies. In this paper, we derive some formulas of the higher-order asymptotic expansions for that integral, with error estimates, which generalize previous results. Moreover, we discuss a comparison of these asymptotic formulas with approximations using numerical integral.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>On ${}_5\psi_5$ identities of Bailey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide proofs of two ${}_5\psi_5$ summation formulas of Bailey using a ${}_5\phi_4$ identity of Carlitz. We show that in the limiting case, the two ${}_5\psi_5$ identities give rise to two ${}_3\psi_3$ summation formulas of Bailey. Finally, we prove the two ${}_3\psi_3$ identities using a technique initially used by Ismail to prove Ramanujan's ${}_1\psi_1$ summation formula and later by Ismail and Askey to prove Bailey's very-well-poised ${}_6\psi_6$ sum.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10185v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on an arbitrary 3-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary as an invariant probability measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. Proving the nontriviality and the covariance under Riemannian isometries of that measure gives for the first time a non-perturbative, non-topological interacting Euclidean quantum field theory on curved spaces in dimension 3. This answers a longstanding open problem of constructive quantum field theory on curved 3 dimensional backgrounds. To control analytically several Feynman diagrams appearing in the construction of a number of random fields, we introduce a novel approach of renormalization using microlocal and harmonic analysis. This allows to obtain a renormalized equation which involves some universal constants independent of the manifold. We also define a new vectorial Cole-Hopf transform which allows to deal with the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model where $\Phi$ is now a bundle valued random field. In a companion paper, we develop in a self-contained way all the tools from paradifferential and microlocal analysis that we use to build in our manifold setting a number of analytic and probabilistic objects.</description>

      <title>Pfaff's Method Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1797, Pfaff gave a simple proof of a ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric series summation formula which was much later reproved by Andrews in 1996. In the same paper, Andrews also proved other well-known hypergeometric identities using Pfaff's method. In this paper, we prove a number of terminating $q$-hypergeometric series-product identities using Pfaff's method thereby providing a detailed account of its wide applicability.</description>
