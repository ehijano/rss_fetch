      <title>The simplest 2D quantum walk detects chaoticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks have been actively studied from many perspectives, mainly from the statistical physics and quantum information points of view. We here determine the influence of basic chaotic features on the walker behavior. We consider an extremely simple model consisting of alternate one-dimensional walks along the two spatial coordinates of bidimensional closed domains (hard wall billiards). The chaotic or regular behavior that the shape of the boundary induces in the deterministic classical equations of motion and that translates into chaotic signatures for the quantized problem also results in sharp differences for the spectral statistics and morphology of the eigenfunctions of the quantum walker. Unexpectedly, two different quantum mechanical problems share the same kind of features related to the corresponding classical dynamics of one of them.</description>

      <title>The role of edge states for early-warning of tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tipping points (TP) are often described as low-dimensional bifurcations, and are associated with early-warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down (CSD). CSD is an increase in amplitude and correlation of noise-induced fluctuations away from a reference attractor as the TP is approached. But for high-dimensional systems it is not obvious which variables or observables would display the critical dynamics and carry CSD. Many variables may display no CSD, or show changes in variability not related to a TP. It is thus helpful to identify beforehand which observables are relevant for a given TP. Here we propose this may be achieved by knowledge of an unstable edge state that separates the reference from an alternative attractor that remains after the TP. This is because stochastic fluctuations away from the reference attractor are preferentially directed towards the edge state along a most likely path (the instanton). As the TP is approached the edge state and reference attractor typically become closer, and the fluctuations can evolve further along the instanton. This can be exploited to find observables with substantial CSD, which we demonstrate using conceptual dynamical systems models and climate model simulations of a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).</description>

      <title>On building the state error covariance from a state estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently found with the aid of machine learning that for a variety of toy data assimilation systems with chaotic Lorenz-96 model it is possible to achieve a nearly-optimal data assimilation without carrying the state error covariance between cycles. This result does not look surprising on its own because not carrying covariance is the approach taken by standard 4D-Var, but it was found ``astonishing'' in the context of the machine learning-based system trained on the ensemble Kalman filter. This note proposes two algorithms for building the state error covariance from a state estimate that yield good performance and could be worked out by the deep learning-based system.</description>
