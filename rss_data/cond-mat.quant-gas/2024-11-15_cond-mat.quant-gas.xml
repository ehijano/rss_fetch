      <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.</description>

      <title>Acceleration-driven dynamics of Josephson vortices in coplanar superfluid rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of topologically protected excitations, such as quantum vortices in atomtronic circuits, opens new possibilities for future quantum technologies. We theoretically investigate the dynamics of Josephson vortices (rotational fluxons) induced by coupled persistent currents in a system of coplanar double-ring atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. We study the Josephson effect in an atomic Josephson junction formed by coaxial ring-shaped condensates. Tunneling superflows, initiated by an imbalance in atomic populations between the rings, are significantly influenced by the persistent currents in the inner and outer rings. This results in pronounced Josephson oscillations in the population imbalance for both co-rotating and non-rotating states. If a linear acceleration is applied to the system, our analysis reveals peculiar azimuthal tunneling patterns and dynamics of Josephson vortices which leads to non-zero net tunneling current and shows sensitivity to the acceleration magnitude. When multiple Josephson vortices are present, asymmetric vortex displacements that correlate with both the magnitude and direction of acceleration can be measured, offering potential for quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. We then engineer a fermionic color code which corrects for both phase and loss errors. We show how to realize a universal fermionic gate set in this code, including transversal Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we realize qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms for simulating fermions. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates by introducing a neutral-atom braiding gate using photodissociation of bosonic molecules. As an application, we consider the fermionic fast Fourier transform, an important subroutine for simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ and a linear improvement from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ in Clifford gate complexity compared to state-of-the-art qubit-only approaches. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Critical states exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical states of disordered systems are intriguing subjects within the realm of condensed matter physics and complex systems. These states manifest in materials where disorder plays a significant role, and are distinguished by their multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, accurately characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge. In this study, we argue that critical states exhibit a certain invariance in both position and momentum spaces, leading to their delocalization in both domains. More specifically, it is expected that typical physical quantities characterizing critical states, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, should exhibit invariance in both position space and momentum space. Subsequent numerical simulations validate the correctness of this invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduced dielectric screening in atomically thin semiconductors leads to remarkably strong electron interactions. As a result, bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and charged excitons (trions), which have binding energies in the hundreds and tens of meV, respectively, typically dominate the optical properties of these materials. However, the long-range nature of the interactions between charges represents a significant challenge to the exact calculation of binding energies of complexes larger than the exciton. Here, we demonstrate that the trion binding energy can be efficiently calculated directly from the three-body Schr\"odinger equation in momentum space. Key to this result is a highly accurate way of treating the pole of the electronic interactions at small momentum exchange (i.e., large separation between charges). Our results are in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo calculations, while yielding a substantially larger ratio of the trion to exciton binding energies than obtained in recent variational calculations. Our numerical approach may be extended to a host of different few-body problems in 2D semiconductors, and even potentially to the description of exciton polarons.</description>

      <title>Toward the Observation of Entangled Pairs in BEC analogue Expanding Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair creation is a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. While classical aspects of this phenomenon have been observed, the experimental confirmation of its quantum origin remains elusive. In this article, we quantify the entanglement produced by pair creation in a two dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) analogues of expanding universes and examine the impact of various experimental factors, including decoherence from thermal noise and losses. Our analysis evaluates the feasibility of detecting entanglement in these systems and identifies optimal experimental configurations for achieving this goal. Focusing on the experimental setup detailed in \cite{Viermann:2022wgw}, we demonstrate that entanglement can be observed in these BEC analogues at a significance level of $\sim 2\sigma$ with current capabilities, and at $\gtrsim 3.3\sigma$ with minor improvements. Achieving this would provide unequivocal evidence of the quantum nature of pair creation and validate one of the most iconic predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Accelerated creation of NOON states with ultracold atoms via counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17545v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum control protocol is proposed for the creation of NOON states with $N$ ultracold bosonic atoms on two modes, corresponding to the coherent superposition $\vert N,0\rangle + \vert 0,N\rangle$. This state can be prepared by using a third mode where all bosons are initially placed and which is symmetrically coupled to the two other modes. Tuning the energy of this third mode across the energy level of the other modes allows the adiabatic creation of the NOON state. While this process normally takes too much time to be of practical usefulness, due to the smallness of the involved spectral gap, it can be drastically boosted through counterdiabatic driving which allows for efficient gap engineering. We demonstrate that this process can be implemented in terms of static parameter adaptations that are experimentally feasible with ultracold quantum gases. Gain factors in the required protocol speed are obtained that increase exponentially with the number of involved atoms and thus counterbalance the exponentially slow collective tunneling process underlying this adiabatic transition. Besides optimizing the protocol speed, our NOON state preparation scheme achieves excellent fidelities that are competitive for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Two-doublon Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the limit of strong on-site interactions, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form doublon bound states and undergo BOs in the presence of a tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for doublons, and show that a slight change in $V$ can qualitatively alter their dynamic behaviors. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons behave like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in both one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring Thouless Pumping in the Generalized Creutz Model: A Graphical Method and Modulation Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thouless pumping with nontrivial topological phases provides a powerful means for the manipulation of matter waves in one-dimensional lattice systems. The band topology is revealed by the quantization of pumped charge. In the context of Thouless pumping, we present a graphical representation for the topological phases characterized by the Chern number of an effective two-dimensional band. We illustrate how the two topological phases with distinct Zak phase is connected in the pumping process. Such a visual depiction exhibits typical patterns that is directly related to a linking number and to the Chern number, allowing for the construction of Thouless pumping schemes in a practical way. As a demonstration, we present a generalized Creutz model with tunable Peierls phase, inter-leg imbalance and diagonal hopping. Various modulation schemes for Thouless pumping are studied, focusing on their graphical representations in Bloch space, as well as the quantized pumping phenomenon in real space.</description>
