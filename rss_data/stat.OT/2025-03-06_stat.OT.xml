      <title>The impact of the storytelling fallacy on real data examples in methodological research</title>

Abstract: The term "researcher degrees of freedom" (RDF), which was introduced in metascientific literature in the context of the replication crisis in science, refers to the extent of flexibility a scientist has in making decisions related to data analysis. These choices occur at all stages of the data analysis process. In combination with selective reporting, RDF may lead to over-optimistic statements and an increased rate of false positive findings. Even though the concept has been mainly discussed in fields such as epidemiology or psychology, similar problems affect methodological statistical research. Researchers who develop and evaluate statistical methods are left with a multitude of decisions when designing their comparison studies. This leaves room for an over-optimistic representation of the performance of their preferred method(s). The present paper defines and explores a particular RDF that has not been previously identified and discussed. When interpreting the results of real data examples that are most often part of methodological evaluations, authors typically tell a domain-specific "story" that best supports their argumentation in favor of their preferred method. However, there are often plenty of other plausible stories that would support different conclusions. We define the "storytelling fallacy" as the selective use of anecdotal domain-specific knowledge to support the superiority of specific methods in real data examples. While such examples fed by domain knowledge play a vital role in methodological research, if deployed inappropriately they can also harm the validity of conclusions on the investigated methods. The goal of our work is to create awareness for this issue, fuel discussions on the role of real data in generating evidence in methodological research and warn readers of methodological literature against naive interpretations of real data examples.</description>
