      <title>A game of life with dormancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The factors contributing to the persistence and stability of life are fundamental for understanding complex living systems. Organisms are commonly challenged by harsh and fluctuating environments that are suboptimal for growth and reproduction, which can lead to extinction. Species often contend with unfavorable and noisy conditions by entering a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity, a phenomenon known as dormancy. Here, we develop Spore Life, a model to investigate the effects of dormancy on population dynamics. It is based on Conway's Game of Life, a deterministic cellular automaton where simple rules govern the metabolic state of an individual based on the metabolic state of its neighbors. For individuals that would otherwise die, Spore Life provides a refuge in the form of an inactive state. These dormant individuals (spores) can resuscitate when local conditions improve. The model includes a parameter alpha that controls the survival probability of spores, interpolating between Game of Life (alpha = 0) and Spore Life (alpha = 1), while capturing stochastic dynamics in the intermediate regime (0 &lt; alpha &lt; 1). In addition to identifying the emergence of unique periodic configurations, we find that spore survival increases the average number of active individuals and buffers populations from extinction. Contrary to expectations, the stabilization of the population is not the result of a large and long-lived seed bank. Instead, the demographic patterns in Spore Life only require a small number of resuscitation events. Our approach yields novel insight into what is minimally required for the emergence of complex behaviors associated with dormancy and the seed banks that they generate.</description>

      <title>Inverse population genetic problems with noise: inferring extent and structure of haplotype blocks from point allele frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A haplotype block, or simply a block, is a chromosomal segment, DNA base sequence or string that occurs in only a few variants or types in the genomes of a population of interest, and that has an encapsulated or 'private' frequency distribution of the string types that is not shared by neighbouring blocks or regions on the same chromosome. We consider two inverse problems of genetic interest: from just the frequencies of the symbol types (4 base types, possible single-base alleles) at each position (point, base/nucleotide) along the string, infer the location of the left and right boundaries of the block (block extent), and the number and relative frequencies of the string types occurring in the block (block structure). The large majority of variable positions in human and also other (e.g., fungal) genomes appear to be biallelic, i.e., the position allows only a choice between two possible symbols. The symbols can then be encoded as 0 (major) and 1 (minor), or as $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ as in Ising models, so the scenario reduces to problems on Boolean strings/bitstrings and Boolean matrices. The specifying of major allele frequencies (MAF) as used in genetics fits naturally into this framework. A simple example from human chromosome 9 is presented.</description>

      <title>Extended error threshold mechanism in {\it quasispecies} theory via population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Eigen's model for the evolution of the genetic code of microorganisms using a novel method based on population dynamics analysis. This model, for a given number of offspring, determines long-term survival as a function of the "genetic" information length and copy error probability. There exists a maximum threshold for the quantity of information that can be consistently preserved through the process of evolution within a population of perfectly replicating sequences, meaning no errors are allowed. With our formula, we expand upon the traditional error threshold formula of Eigen's theory and introduce a new expression for general cases where the self-reproduction process allows up to any integer number of copying errors per digit per replication step.</description>

      <title>The Dangerous Allure of Low Fertility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic population and wealth trajectories for societies as functions of fertility are modeled with a minimal, endogenous model of a simple foraging economy. The model is scaled to match human lifespans and overall death rates. Stochastic population instability at both the high and low ends of fertility are considered. Lower population levels, caused by low fertility, generate concerns on economic growth, military security, and international political power; while also seen by some as reducing ecological and environmental damage. The model shows that increasingly low fertility leads to both higher wealth and lower population levels. As society is encouraged by increasing per capita wealth to continue to decrease fertility, dangerous population regimes are reached where stochastic extinction becomes more and more likely.</description>

      <title>Muller's ratchet in a near-critical regime: tournament versus fitness proportional selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muller's ratchet, in its prototype version, models a haploid, asexual population whose size~$N$ is constant over the generations. Slightly deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. The classical variant considers {\it fitness proportional} selection, but other fitness schemes are conceivable as well. Inspired by the work of Etheridge et al. ([EPW09]) we propose a parameter scaling which fits well to the ``near-critical'' regime that was in the focus of [EPW09] (and in which the mutation-selection ratio diverges logarithmically as $N\to \infty$). Using a Moran model, we investigate the``rule of thumb'' given in [EPW09] for the click rate of the ``classical ratchet'' by putting it into the context of new results on the long-time evolution of the size of the best class of the ratchet with (binary) tournament selection, which (other than that of the classical ratchet) follows an autonomous dynamics up to the time of its extinction.
  In [GSW23] it was discovered that the tournament ratchet has a hierarchy of dual processes which can be constructed on top of an Ancestral Selection graph with a Poisson decoration. For a regime in which the mutation/selection-ratio remains bounded away from 1, this was used in [GSW23] to reveal the asymptotics of the click rates as well as that of the type frequency profile between clicks. We will describe how these ideas can be extended to the near-critical regime in which the mutation-selection ratio of the tournament ratchet converges to 1 as $N\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing data-limited assessments with random effects: A case study on Korea chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a state-space framework, temporal variations in fishery-dependent processes can be modeled as random effects. This modeling flexibility makes state-space models (SSMs) powerful tools for data-limited assessments. Though SSMs enable the model-based inference of the unobserved processes, their flexibility can lead to overfitting and non-identifiability issues. To address these challenges, we developed a suite of state-space length-based age-structured models and applied them to the Korean chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) stock. Our research demonstrated that incorporating temporal variations in fishery-dependent processes can rectify model mis-specification but may compromise robustness, which can be diagnosed through a series of model checking processes. To tackle non-identifiability, we used a non-degenerate estimator, implementing a gamma distribution as a penalty for the standard deviation parameters of observation errors. This penalty function enabled the simultaneous estimation of both process and observation error variances with minimal bias, a notably challenging task in SSMs. These results highlight the importance of model checking and the effectiveness of the penalized approach in estimating SSMs. Additionally, we discussed novel assessment outcomes for the mackerel stock.</description>

      <title>A picture guide to cancer progression and monotonic accumulation models: evolutionary assumptions, plausible interpretations, and alternative uses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06824v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cancer progression and monotonic accumulation models were developed to discover dependencies in the irreversible acquisition of binary traits from cross-sectional data. They have been used in computational oncology and virology but also in widely different problems such as malaria progression. These methods have been applied to predict future states of the system, identify routes of feature acquisition, and improve patient stratification, and they hold promise for evolutionary-based treatments. New methods continue to be developed.
  But these methods have shortcomings, which are yet to be systematically critiqued, regarding key evolutionary assumptions and interpretations. After an overview of the available methods, we focus on why inferences might not be about the processes we intend. Using fitness landscapes, we highlight difficulties that arise from bulk sequencing and reciprocal sign epistasis, from conflating lines of descent, path of the maximum, and mutational profiles, and from ambiguous use of the idea of exclusivity. We examine how the previous concerns change when bulk sequencing is explicitly considered, and underline opportunities for addressing dependencies due to frequency-dependent selection. This review identifies major standing issues, and should encourage the use of these methods in other areas with a better alignment between entities and model assumptions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution of Altruistic Punishment with a PDE Model of Cultural Multilevel Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two mechanisms that have been used to study the evolution of cooperative behavior are altruistic punishment, in which cooperative individuals pay additional costs to punish defection, and multilevel selection, in which competition between groups can help to counteract individual-level incentives to cheat. Boyd, Gintis, Bowles, and Richerson have used simulation models of cultural evolution to suggest that altruistic punishment and pairwise group-level competition can work in concert to promote cooperation, even when neither mechanism can do so on its own. In this paper, we formulate a PDE model for multilevel selection motivated by the approach of Boyd and coauthors, modeling individual-level birth-death competition with a replicator equation based on individual payoffs and describing group-level competition with pairwise conflicts based on differences in the average payoffs of the competing groups. Building off of existing PDE models for multilevel selection with frequency-independent group-level competition, we use analytical and numerical techniques to understand how the forms of individual and average payoffs can impact the long-time ability to sustain altruistic punishment in group-structured populations. We find several interesting differences between the behavior of our new PDE model with pairwise group-level competition and existing multilevel PDE models, including the observation that our new model can feature a non-monotonic dependence of the long-time collective payoff on the strength of altruistic punishment. Going forward, our PDE framework can serve as a way to connect and compare disparate approaches for understanding multilevel selection across the literature in evolutionary biology and anthropology.</description>

      <title>Natural Selection and Random Matrix Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We will study the relationship between two well-known theories, genetic evolution and random matrix theory in the context of many-body systems. We show that the time evolution of certain quantum mechanical toy models is similar to that of a living cell. It is also suggested that genetic evolution can be described by a random matrix theory with statistical distribution in which natural selection acts as a Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition.</description>

      <title>Kinetic description of swarming dynamics with topological interaction and transient leaders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a model describing the collective motion of birds. The model introduces spontaneous changes in direction which are initialized by few agents, here referred as leaders, whose influence act on their nearest neighbors, in the following referred as followers. Starting at the microscopic level, we develop a kinetic model that characterizes the behaviour of large flocks with transient leadership. One significant challenge lies in managing topological interactions, as identifying nearest neighbors in extensive systems can be computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a novel stochastic particle method to simulate the mesoscopic dynamics and reduce the computational cost of identifying closer agents from quadratic to logarithmic complexity using a $k$-nearest neighbours search algorithm with a binary tree. Lastly, we conduct various numerical experiments for different scenarios to validate the algorithm's effectiveness and investigate collective dynamics in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Embedding of Markov matrices for $d\leqslant 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The embedding problem of Markov matrices in Markov semigroups is a classic problem that regained a lot of impetus and activities through recent needs in phylogeny and population genetics. Here, we give an account for dimensions $d\leqslant 4$, including a complete and simplified treatment of the case $d=3$, and derive the results in a systematic fashion, with an eye on the potential applications.
  Further, we reconsider the setup of the corresponding problem for time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, which is needed for real-world applications because transition rates need not be constant over time. Additional cases of this more general embedding occur for any $d\geqslant 3$. We review the known case of $d=3$ and describe the setting for future work on $d=4$.</description>
