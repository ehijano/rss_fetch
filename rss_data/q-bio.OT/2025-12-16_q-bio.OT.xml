      <title>Prevalence of Upper Extremity Distal Predominant Weakness Pattern in Chronic Stroke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Hemiparesis after subcortical stroke is classically described as distal upper-extremity (UE) predominant, but prevalence data in chronic stroke is limited. Objective: Determine the prevalence of distal predominant UE weakness in exclusively subcortical chronic stroke versus other stroke distributions, characterize cohort differences, and describe UE weakness patterns in chronic stroke overall. Methods: Outpatient records were retrospectively reviewed to identify chronic stroke subjects. Lesion locations were classified from radiographic reports as exclusively subcortical or not (using a whole brain and supratentorial definition). UE weakness was categorized as distal predominant or not. Prevalence was compared with $\chi$-squared testing and odds ratios (OR). Results: 250 subjects were included (mean 861 days post-stroke). Using the whole-brain definition, distal predominant weakness occurred in 30.6% of exclusively subcortical versus 17.4% of non-exclusively subcortical strokes (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15-3.81; p=0.014). Using the supratentorial definition, distal predominant weakness occurred in 27.9% versus 17.9%, respectively (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.17-3.96; p=0.012). Across all chronic strokes, 60% had no UE weakness; distal predominant weakness was the most common weakness pattern (23%), followed by uniform UE weakness (12%); proximal predominant weakness was rare (3%). Conclusions: Distal predominant UE weakness is more prevalent in chronic exclusively subcortical stroke than in non-subcortical stroke. These prevalence estimates may help predict long-term outcomes based on lesion location, support rehabilitation planning, and aid clinical lesion localization and research prioritization.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Hematology Analyzers: Next-Generation Technologies for Precision Diagnostics and Personalized Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hematology analyzers are essential diagnostic and monitoring tools for detecting blood diseases. Although contemporary analyzers produce only basic insights, they are often not as detailed as required under the personalized medicine paradigm. Next-Generation Hematology Analyzers (NGHAs) are revolutionary newcomers in the field, with significant advantages over regular hematology analyzers. They provide deeper insights into cellular morphology, function, and genetic profiles. This detailed information opens up possibilities for tailor-made diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in precision medicine. This review presents some revolutionary technologies that have changed hematology analyzers and provides an overview of their limitations, basic functions, and influence on clinical practice. It focuses on the integration of state-of-the-art technologies, such as microfluidics, advanced optics, artificial intelligence, flow cytometry, and digital imaging, empowering NGHAs to improve diagnostic accuracy, rapidly detect diseases, and support flexible, targeted therapy. Hints regarding point-of-care hematology testing are also provided to discuss its implications for transforming healthcare patterns. This review highlights the data management, standardization, regulatory, and ethical challenges associated with these technologies. A review tracking the current state-of-the-art and trends for the future is provided to show how these advancements may reconfigure hematology analyzer design and act as a stepping stone for future therapeutic reforms.</description>
