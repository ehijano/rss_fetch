      <title>Non-Hermitian butterfly spectra in a family of quasiperiodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a family of exactly solvable quasiperiodic lattice models with analytical complex mobility edges, which can incorporate mosaic modulations as a straightforward generalization. By sweeping a potential tuning parameter $\delta$, we demonstrate a kind of interesting butterfly-like spectra in complex energy plane, which depicts energy-dependent extended-localized transitions sharing a common exact non-Hermitian mobility edge. Applying Avila's global theory, we are able to analytically calculate the Lyapunov exponents and determine the mobility edges exactly. For the minimal model without mosaic modulation, a compactly analytic formula for the complex mobility edges is obtained, which, together with analytical estimation of the range of complex energy spectrum, gives the true mobility edge. The non-Hermitian mobility edge in complex energy plane is further verified by numerical calculations of fractal dimension and spatial distribution of wave functions. Tuning parameters of non-Hermitian potentials, we also investigate the variations of the non-Hermitian mobility edges and the corresponding butterfly spectra, which exhibit richness of spectrum structures.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous mean-field analysis of the generalized Lotka-Volterra model on a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with a network structure. Performing a high connectivity expansion for graphs, we write down a mean-field dynamical theory that incorporates degree heterogeneity. This allows us to describe the fixed points of the model in terms of a few simple order parameters. We extend the analysis even for diverging abundances, using a mapping to the replicator model. With this we present a unified approach for both cooperative and competitive systems that display complementary behaviors. In particular we show the central role of an order parameter called the critical degree, $g_c$. In the competitive regime $g_c$ serves to distinguish high degree nodes that are more likely to go extinct, while in the cooperative regime it has the reverse role, it will determine the low degree nodes that tend to go relatively extinct.</description>

      <title>Global topological synchronization of weighted simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order networks are able to capture the many-body interactions present in complex systems and to unveil new fundamental phenomena revealing the rich interplay between topology, geometry, and dynamics. Simplicial complexes are higher-order networks that encode higher-order topology and dynamics of complex systems. Specifically, simplicial complexes can sustain topological signals, i.e., dynamical variables not only defined on nodes of the network but also on their edges, triangles, and so on. Topological signals can undergo collective phenomena such as synchronization, however, only some higher-order network topologies can sustain global synchronization of topological signals. Here we consider global topological synchronization of topological signals on weighted simplicial complexes. We demonstrate that topological signals can globally synchronize on weighted simplicial complexes, even if they are odd-dimensional, e.g., edge signals, overcoming thus a limitation of the unweighted case. These results thus demonstrate that weighted simplicial complexes are more advantageous for observing these collective phenomena than their unweighted counterpart. In particular, we present two weighted simplicial complexes the Weighted Triangulated Torus and the Weighted Waffle. We completely characterize their higher-order spectral properties and we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions on their weights, they can sustain global synchronization of edge signals. Our results are interpreted geometrically by showing, among the other results, that in some cases edge weights can be associated with the lengths of the sides of curved simplices.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Methods for Colloidal Silver Nanoparticle Concentration and Size Distribution Determination from UV-Vis Extinction Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron microscopy, while reliable, is an expensive, slow, and inefficient technique for thorough size distribution characterization of both mono- and polydisperse colloidal nanoparticles. If rapid in-situ characterization of colloid samples is to be achieved, a different approach, based on fast, widely accessible, and inexpensive optical measurements such as UV-Vis spectroscopy in combination with spectra interpretation related to Mie scattering theory, is needed. In this article, we present a tandem deep neural network (DNN) for the size distribution and concentration prediction of close to spherical silver colloidal nanoparticle batches synthesized via the seeded growth method. The first DNN identified the dipole component of the localized surface plasmon resonance and the second one determined the size distribution from the isolated spectral component. The training data was engineered to be bias-free and generated numerically. High prediction accuracy with typical root mean square percentage error of mean size ca. 1.2% was maintained, spanning the entire prediction range up to 150 nm in radius, suggesting the possible extension limits of the effective medium theory used for simulating the spectra. The DNN-predicted nanoparticle concentrations also were very close to the ones expected based on synthesis precursor contents as well as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Discovering Factorization Surface of Quantum Spin Chains with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems is required for a variety of quantum information tasks, making it crucial to identify the parameter space in which the ground state is fully separable, known as the factorization surface (FS). Nonetheless, the tuning parameters indicating FS for several quantum spin models remain unknown. We employ symbolic regression (SR), a supervised learning technique, to determine a closed-form expression in the parameter regime corresponding to FS of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. We verify the effectiveness of this method by examining the analytically tractable models, namely a nearest-neighbor (NN) quantum transverse XY model with additional Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Aharony interactions, for which the FS is well-known. We construct an accurate expression for the FS of the XYZ model by providing the parameter set through the SR algorithm in which the ground state is derived by matrix product state formalism. With a satisfactory level of accuracy, we estimate the FS for the long-range XY model, and the NN XY model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type asymmetric interaction for which the factorization surface is not known.</description>

      <title>Transition Graphs of Interacting Hysterons: Structure, Design, Organization and Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collections of bistable elements called hysterons provide a powerful model to capture the sequential response and memory effects of frustrated, multistable media in the athermal, quasistatic limit. While a century of work has elucidated, in great detail, the properties of ensembles of non-interacting hysterons - the so-called Preisach model - comparatively little is known about the behavior and properties of interacting hysterons. Here we discuss a general framework for interacting hysterons, focussing on the relation between the design parameters that specify the hysterons and their interactions, and the resulting transition graphs (t-graphs). We show how the structure of such t-graphs can be thought of as being composed of a scaffold that is dressed by (avalanche) transitions selected from finite binary trees. Moreover, we provide a systematic framework to straightforwardly determine the design inequalities for a given t-graph, and discuss an effective method to determine if a certain t-graph topology is realizable by a set of interacting hysterons. Altogether, our work builds on the Preisach model by generalizing the hysteron-dependent switching fields to the state-dependent switching fields. As a result, while in the Preisach model, the main loop identifies the critical hysterons that trigger a transition, in the case of interacting hysterons, the scaffold contains this critical information and assumes a central role in determining permissible transitions. In addition, our work suggests strategies to deal with the combinatorial explosion of the number and variety of t-graphs for interacting hysterons. This approach paves the way for a deeper theoretical understanding of the properties and statistics of t-graphs, and opens a route to materializing complex pathways, memory effects and embodied computations in (meta)materials based on interacting hysterons.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of amorphous Na$_3$OCl electrolyte by first-principles and machine learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes mark a significant leap forward in the field of electrochemical energy storage, offering improved safety and efficiency compared to conventional liquid electrolytes. Among these, antiperovskite electrolytes, particularly those based on Li and Na, have emerged as promising candidates due to their superior ionic conductivity and straightforward synthesis processes. This study focuses on the amorphous phase of antiperovskite Na$_3$OCl, assessing its structural properties through a combination of first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) simulations. Our comprehensive analysis spans models ranging from 135 to 3645 atoms, allowing for a detailed examination of X-ray and neutron structure factors, total and partial pair correlation functions, coordination numbers, and structural unit distributions. We demonstrate the minimal, albeit partially present, size effects on these structural features and validate the accuracy of the MLIP model in reproducing the intricate details of the amorphous Na$_3$OCl structure described at the FPMD level.</description>

      <title>Fidelity decay and error accumulation in quantum volume circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. We devise an analytical bound to the average fidelity between the desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. We demonstrate that fidelity decays exponentially with both the number of qubits and circuit depth, and determine the decay rates as a function of the parameterized probabilities of the two types of errors. These decay constants are intricately linked to the connectivity and dimensionality of the processor's architecture. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting fidelity trends in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <title>Localized dopant motion across the 2D Ising phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I investigate the motion of a single hole in 2D spin lattices with square and triangular geometries. While the spins have nearest neighbor Ising spin couplings $J$, the hole is allowed to move only in 1D along a single line in the 2D lattice with nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $t$. The non-equilibrium hole dynamics is initialized by suddenly removing a single spin from the thermal Ising spin lattice. I find that for any nonzero spin coupling and temperature, the hole is localized. This is an extension of the thermally induced localization phenomenon [arXiv:2310.11193] to the case, where there is a phase transition to a long-range ordered ferromagnetic phase. The dynamics depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the spin coupling, $k_BT / |J|$, and on the ratio of the spin coupling to the hopping $J/t$. I characterize these dependencies in great detail. In particular, I find universal behavior at high temperatures, common features for the square and triangular lattices across the Curie temperatures for ferromagnetic interactions, and highly distinct behaviors for the two geometries in the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions due geometric frustration in the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Population annealing with topological defect driven nonlocal updates for spin systems with quenched disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Population Annealing, one of the currently state-of-the-art algorithms for solving spin-glass systems, sometimes finds hard disorder instances for which its equilibration quality at each temperature step is severely damaged. In such cases one can therefore not be sure about having reached the true ground state without vastly increasing the computational resources. In this work we seek to overcome this problem by proposing a quantum-inspired modification of Population Annealing. Here we focus on three-dimensional random plaquette gauge model which ground state energy problem seems to be much harder to solve than standard spin-glass Edwards-Anderson model. In analogy to the Toric Code, by allowing single bond flips we let the system explore non-physical states, effectively expanding the configurational space by the introduction of topological defects that are then annealed through an additional field parameter. The dynamics of these defects allow for the effective realization of non-local cluster moves, potentially easing the equilibration process. We study the performance of this new method in three-dimensional random plaquette gauge model lattices of various sizes and compare it against Population Annealing. With that we conclude that the newly introduced non-local moves are able to improve the equilibration of the lattices, in some cases being superior to a normal Population Annealing algorithm with a sixteen times higher computational resource investment.</description>
