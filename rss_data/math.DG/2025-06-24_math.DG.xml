      <title>An ansatz for constructing explicit solutions of Hessian equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a (variation of quadrics) ansatz for constructing explicit, real-valued solutions to broad classes of complex Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ and real Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In the complex setting, our method simultaneously addresses the deformed Hermitian--Yang--Mills/Leung--Yau--Zaslow (dHYM/LYZ) equation, the Monge--Amp\`ere equation, and the $J$-equation. Under this ansatz each PDE reduces to a second-order system of ordinary differential equations admitting explicit first integrals. These ODE systems integrate in closed form via abelian integrals, producing wide families of explicit solutions together with a detailed description. In particular, on $\mathbb{C}^3$, we construct entire dHYM/LYZ solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase, and on $\mathbb{R}^3$ we produce entire special Lagrangian solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase. More generally, in any complex or real dimension, our ansatz yields entire solutions of certain subcritical phases for both the dHYM/LYZ and special Lagrangian equations. Some of these solutions develop singularities on compact regions. In the special Lagrangian case we show that, after a natural extension across the singular locus, these blow-up solutions coincide with previously known complete special Lagrangian submanifolds obtained via a different ansatz.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Analysis of Conformal Maps and the Willmore Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternionic analysis, which describes conformal maps from Riemann surfaces into $\mathbb{R}^3$ or $\mathbb{R}^4$, is extended to weakly conformal maps. As a consequence we present a new proof that on any compact Riemann surface $X$ the Willmore functional, the integral of the square of the mean curvature, attains a minimum on the space of smooth conformal maps from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$ or $\mathbb{R}^4$. This was first proven by Kuwert and Sch\"atzle under the assumption that the infimum of the Willmore functional is less than $8\pi$. In this case all conformal maps are unbranched, due to an estimate of Li and Yau. Rivi\`ere removed this restriction by allowing as limits conformal maps with ramification points. Our approach admits these weakly conformal maps from the very beginning, by extending the quaternionic function theory as developed by Pedit and Pinkall to square-integrable potentials.
  In Part~I we carry over the most important properties of holomorphic functions to quaternionic analysis with square-integrable potentials. We develop a differential operator, the Darboux transformation, that generalizes the $\partial$-derivative and with respect to which these holomorphic functions are infinitely many times differentiable. It transforms the Kodaira representation of a weakly conformal map into its Weierstra{\ss} representation. Parts~II and~III treat respectively the existence of a minima on the space of weakly conformal maps with ramification points and the regularity of this minima.</description>

      <title>Several complex structures on the Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate complex structures on the Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds. The Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds are defined using complex embeddings of number fields. By replacing these embeddings with their conjugates, one obtains other manifolds that share the same underlying differential structure. In this paper, we give an algebraic description of when such manifolds are biholomorphic. As a simple application, we obtain compact non-K\"{a}hler manifolds of dimension $2t+1$ that admit $2^t$ different rigid complex structures.</description>

      <title>Notes on the uniqueness of Type II Yamabe metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the uniqueness of type II Yamabe metrics in conformal classes on a compact connected manifold with boundary, and we investigate Obata-type theorems for type II Yamabe metrics. In particular, we establish a theorem which gives a sufficient condition for a metric to be the unique Type II Yamabe metric in its conformal class. We also prove the corresponding theorem for the CR Yamabe problem on closed manifolds.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{G}$-uniform weighted K-stability for models on klt varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we make a generalization of the results in \cite{Li22a} to the singular and weighted setting. In particular, we show that on a polarized projective klt variety, the $\mathbb{G}$-uniform weighted K-stability for models implies the $\mathbb{G}$-coercivity of the weighted Mabuchi functional. In the toric case, we further show that the $(\mathbb{C}^{\times})^n$-uniform $(\mathrm{v},\mathrm{w}\cdot\ell_{\mathrm{ext}})$-weighted K-stability is preserved when perturbing the polarization on the resolution, which implies the existence of the weighted extremal metric(s) on the resolution if the weight function $\mathrm{v}$ is log-concave.</description>

      <title>Exotic hypercomplex structures on a torus do not exist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypercomplex manifold is a manifold with three complex structures satisfying quaternionic relations. Such a manifold admits a unique torsion-free connection preserving the quaternionic action, called the Obata connection. A compact Kahler manifold admitting a hypercomplex structure always admits a hyperkahler structure as well; however, it is not obvious whether the original hypercomplex structure is hyperkahler. A non-hyperkahler hypercomplex structure on a Kahler manifold is called exotic. We show that the Obata connection for an exotic hypercomplex structure on a torus is flat and classify complete flat affine structures on real tori. We use this classification to prove that exotic hypercomplex structures do not exist.</description>

      <title>The Exponential of Skew-Symmetric Matrices: A Nearby Inverse and Efficient Computation of Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix exponential restricted to skew-symmetric matrices has numerous applications, notably in view of its interpretation as the Lie group exponential and Riemannian exponential for the special orthogonal group. We characterize the invertibility of the derivative of the skew-restricted exponential, thereby providing a simple expression of the tangent conjugate locus of the orthogonal group. In view of the skew restriction, this characterization differs from the classic result on the invertibility of the derivative of the exponential of real matrices. Based on this characterization, for every skew-symmetric matrix $A$ outside the (zero-measure) tangent conjugate locus, we explicitly construct the domain and image of a smooth inverse -- which we term \emph{nearby logarithm} -- of the skew-restricted exponential around $A$. This nearby logarithm reduces to the classic principal logarithm of special orthogonal matrices when $A=\mathbf{0}$. The symbolic formulae for the differentiation and its inverse are derived and implemented efficiently. The extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed formulae are up to $3.9$-times and $3.6$-times faster than the current state-of-the-art robust formulae for the differentiation and its inversion, respectively.</description>

      <title>Atiyah constructions for Lie algebroid connections on fiber bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the need for a unified framework that incorporates Lie algebroid connections on both vector and principal bundles, this paper investigates a generalized Atiyah algebroid structure and its short exact sequence. Building on this generalization, we describe Atiyah-type extensions and sequences that represent Atiyah classes through three explicit constructions designed to encode Lie algebroid connections compatible with specified sub-structures. As illustrative examples, we work out an enriched Atiyah algebroid construct, providing a systematic tool to characterize certain key properties of holomorphic connections and invariant connections.</description>

      <title>On the volume of K-semistable Fano manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the volume of an $n$-dimensional K-semistable Fano manifold that is not $\mathbb{P}^n$ is at most $2n^n$. Moreover, the equality holds only if $X\cong \mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ or $X$ is a smooth quadric hypersurface $Q\subset \mathbb{P}^{n+1}$. Our proof is based on a new connection between K-semistability and minimal rational curves. More generally, we show that the volume of a K-semistable Fano manifold with a minimal rational curve of degree $d$ is bounded above by the volume of $\mathbb{P}^{d-1}\times \mathbb{P}^{n-d+1}$.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonal estimates of the Bergman kernel associated to Siegel varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $g\geq 2$, let $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{R})$ be a discrete subgroup, which is either a cocompact subgroup or an arithmetic subgroup without torsion elements, and let $\mathbb{H}_{g}$ denote the Siegel upper half space of genus $g$. Let $X_{\Gamma}:=\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}_{g}$ denote the quotient space, which is a complex manifold of dimension $g(g+1)/2$. Let $\Omega_{X_{\Gamma}}$ denote the cotangent bundle, and let $\ell:=\mathrm{det}(\Omega_{X_{\Gamma}})$ denote the determinant line bundle of $\Omega_{X_{\Gamma}}$. For any $Z,W\in X_{\Gamma}$, let $d_{\mathrm{S}}(Z,W)$ denote the geodesic distance between the points $Z$ and $W$ on $X_{\Gamma}$.
  \vspace{0.15cm}\noindent For any $k\geq 1$, let $H^{0}(X_{\Gamma},\ell^{\otimes k})$ denote the complex vector space of global sections of the line bundle $\ell^{\otimes k}$, and let $\|\cdot\|_{k}$ denote the point-wise norm on $\ell^{\otimes k}$. Let $\mathcal{B}_{X_{\Gamma}}^{\ell^{ k}}$ denote the Bergman kernel associated to $H^{0}_{L^{2}}(X_{\Gamma},\ell^{\otimes k})\subset H^{0}(X_{\Gamma},\ell^{\otimes k})$, vector subspace of $L^2$ global sections. For any $k\gg 1$, and $Z,W\in X_{\Gamma}$ , we derive estimates of the Bergman kernel $\|\mathcal{B}_{X_{\Gamma}}^{\ell^{ k}}(Z,W)\|_{\ell^{k}}$, when $\Gamma$ is a cocompact subgroup and when $\Gamma$ is an arithmetic subgroup.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Hodge Conjecture for a Special Class of Calabi-Yau 5-Folds via Exceptional Group Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete proof of the (1,1)-type Hodge conjecture for a special class of 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds ($h^{1,1}=56$), while establishing and implementing a novel methodology based on exceptional group constraints. The core idea of this methodology is to replace the "geometric construction" that traditional methods rely on -- which becomes infeasible in high-dimensional cases -- with the "algebraic rigidity" of Lie algebra representation theory. We prove that by introducing the symmetry of the $E_7$ group, we can generate a "dimension tension" in the Spencer cohomology framework we developed, which forcibly makes the dimension of the Spencer kernel precisely match the Hodge numbers of the manifold, thereby bypassing concrete algebraic geometric calculations. This dimension matching result is a key step in satisfying the "Spencer-Hodge verification criterion" we previously established. Its completion not only solves a non-trivial special case of the Hodge conjecture, but more importantly, provides the first strong evidence for this new paradigm of connecting representation theory with Hodge theory to solve core problems in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a fine structural result for two-dimensional mod$(q)$ area-minimizing currents of codimension one, close to flat singularities. Precisely, we show that, locally around any such singularity, the current is a $C^{1,\alpha}$-perturbation of the graph of a radially homogeneous special multiple-valued function that arises from a superposition of homogeneous harmonic polynomials. Additionally, as a preliminary step towards an analogous result in arbitrary codimension, we prove in general that the set of flat singularities of density $\frac{q}{2}$, where the current is ``genuinely mod$(q)$", consists of isolated points.</description>

      <title>Geometric Contact Flows: Contactomorphisms for Dynamics and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, particularly those involving force exchange and dissipation, is crucial for applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robotics, but presents significant challenges due to the intricate interplay of geometric constraints and energy transfer. This paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GFC), a novel framework leveraging Riemannian and Contact geometry as inductive biases to learn such systems. GCF constructs a latent contact Hamiltonian model encoding desirable properties like stability or energy conservation. An ensemble of contactomorphisms then adapts this model to the target dynamics while preserving these properties. This ensemble allows for uncertainty-aware geodesics that attract the system's behavior toward the data support, enabling robust generalization and adaptation to unseen scenarios. Experiments on learning dynamics for physical systems and for controlling robots on interaction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exterior geometries of physical black holes are believed to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter spacetime at late times. A characteristic feature of that vacuum Einstein solution is the presence of a hidden symmetry generated by a closed conformal Killing--Yano tensor. Using this symmetry and modern conformal geometry technology, we find necessary conditions for generic solutions to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter metric. Further, we constrain the admissible form of the geometric free data on the conformal infinity giving rise to this family of spacetimes and constrain it in terms of the stress-energy tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of solutions to the spinorial Yamabe equation -- that is, the Euler--Lagrange equation associated with the conformal invariant introduced by S. Raulot -- for compact manifolds with boundary. For the inhomogeneous equation, we employ an iterative scheme to establish existence under smallness assumptions on the relevant parameters. Using bootstrapping methods, we extend the regularity of the solution to $C^\infty$ away from its zero set in the interior, and up to the boundary in the case of Shapiro--Lopatinski boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with positive isotropic curvature of dimension at least nine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [Bre19], Simon Brendle showed that any compact manifold of dimension $n\geq12$ with positive isotropic curvature and contains no nontrivial incompressible $(n-1)-$dimensional space form is diffeomorphic to a connected sum of finitely many spaces, each of which is a quotient of $S^n$ or $S^{n-1}\times \mathbb{R}$ by standard isometries. We show that this result is actually true for $n\geq9$.</description>

      <title>On foliations admitting a transverse similarity structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a "conceptual" approach to Kourganoff's results about foliations with a transverse similarity structure. In particular, we give a proof, understandable by the targeted community, of the very important result classifying the holonomy of the closed, non-exact Weyl structures on compact manifolds, from which arose the notion of locally conformally product structures. We also extract from the proof several results on foliations admitting locally metric transverse connections.</description>

      <title>$\ast$-$\eta$-Ricci solitons and Einstein metrics on a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18031v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak almost contact metric manifolds (i.e., the complex structure is replaced by a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor), defined by the author and R. Wolak, allow a new look at the classical theory and find novel applications. An important case of these manifolds, which is locally a twisted product, is a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu manifold defined by the author and D.S. Patra. In the paper, the concept of the $\ast$-Ricci tensor is adapted to weak almost contact manifolds, the interaction of the $\ast$-$\eta$-Ricci soliton with the weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu structure (with $\beta=const$) is studied and new characteristics of Einstein metrics are obtained.</description>

      <title>Local rigidity of convex hypersurfaces in spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a local rigidity of convex hypersurfaces in the spaces of constant curvature of dimension $n\ge4$. Namely, we show that two convex isometric hypersurfaces are congruent locally around their corresponding under the isometry points of strict convexity. This result extends the result of E.P. Senkin, who showed such rigidity under the additional assumption of $C^1$-smoothness of the hypersurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a general pressure gap criterion for closed rank 1 manifolds whose singular sets are given by codimension 1 totally geodesic flat subtori. As an application, we show that under certain curvature constraints, potentials that decay faster than geometric potentials (towards to the singular set) have pressure gaps and have no phase transitions. Along the way, we prove that geometric potentials are H\"older continuous near singular sets.</description>

      <title>The free elastic flow for closed planar curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free elastic flow is the $L^2$-gradient flow for Euler's elastic energy, or equivalently the Willmore flow with translation invariant initial data. In contrast to elastic flows under length penalisation or preservation, it is more challenging to study the free elastic flow's asymptotic behavior, and convergence for closed curves is lost. In this paper, we nevertheless determine the asymptotic shape of the flow for initial curves that are geometrically close to circles, possibly multiply-covered, proving that an appropriate rescaling smoothly converges to a unique round circle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the hot spots conjecture on Riemannian manifolds with isothermal coordinates and analytic metrics, such as hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{D}^n$ and spheres $S^n$ for $n\geq 2$. We prove that for some (possibly non-convex) Lipschitz domains in such a Riemannian manifold, which are generalizations of lip domains and symmetric domains with two axes of symmetry in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the hot spot conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Horocycles in hyperbolic 3-manifolds with round Sierpi\'nski limit sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let M be a geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifold whose limit set is a round Sierpi\'nski gasket, i.e. M is geometrically finite and acylindrical with a compact, totally geodesic convex core boundary. In this paper, we classify orbit closures of the 1-dimensional horocycle flow on the frame bundle of M. As a result, the closure of a horocycle in M is a properly immersed submanifold. This extends the work of McMullen-Mohammadi-Oh where M is further assumed to be convex cocompact.</description>

      <title>Curvature, macroscopic dimensions, and symmetric products of surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stratification and Rectifiability of Harmonic Map Flows via Tangent Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stratification theory for ``suitable solutions" of harmonic map flows based on the spatial symmetry of tangent measures. Generally, suitable solutions are a category of solutions that satisfy both the localized energy inequality and the monotonicity formula. Building on the modifications and adjustments of quantitative stratifications and Reifenberg-rectifiable theory by Naber and Valtorta in the breakthrough research of harmonic maps (\emph{Ann. Math.} 185 (2017), 131-227), we confirm that each stratum in our model is rectifiable. Furthermore, for each time slice of the singular set, we establish the estimate of the Minkowski content and demonstrate its rectifiability, strengthening prior findings, which applied only to almost every time slice. Additionally, by making certain assumptions about the target manifolds to exclude specific tangent flows and measures, our analysis yields sharp improvements in the regularity of suitable solutions for harmonic map flows.</description>
