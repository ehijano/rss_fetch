      <title>A Synoptic Review of High-Frequency Oscillations as a Biomarker in Neurodegenerative Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), rapid bursts of brain activity above 80 Hz, have emerged as a highly specific biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.</description>

      <title>SkyTrust: Blockchain-Enhanced UAV Security for NTNs with Dynamic Trust and Energy-Aware Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as base stations are extremely susceptible to security attacks due to their distributed and dynamic nature, which makes them vulnerable to rogue nodes. In this paper, a new Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism with Energy-Aware Consensus (DTSAM-EAC) is proposed to enhance security in UAV-based NTNs. The proposed framework integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with Federated Learning (FL) to support privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Trust ratings are updated continuously through weighted aggregation of past trust, present behavior, and energy contribution, thus making the system adaptive to changing network conditions. An energy-aware consensus mechanism prioritizes UAVs with greater available energy for block validation, ensuring efficient use of resources under resource-constrained environments. FL aggregation with trust-weighting further increases the resilience of the global trust model. Simulation results verify the designed framework achieves 94\% trust score prediction accuracy and 96\% rogue UAV detection rate while outperforming centralized and static baselines of trust-based solutions on privacy, energy efficiency, and reliability. It complies with 6G requirements in terms of distributed intelligence and sustainability and is an energy-efficient and scalable solution to secure NTNs.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Challenges in Ultra-Wideband ISAC: Beamforming Strategies and System Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift toward sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks places integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) at the core of future applications such as autonomous driving, extended reality, and smart manufacturing. However, the combination of large antenna arrays and ultra-wide bandwidths brings near-field propagation effects and beam squint to the forefront, fundamentally challenging traditional far-field designs. True time delay units (TTDs) offer a potential solution, but their cost and hardware complexity limit scalability. In this article, we present practical beamforming strategies for near-field ultra-wideband ISAC systems. We explore codebook designs across analog and digital domains that mitigate beam squint, ensure reliable user coverage, and enhance sensing accuracy. We further validate these approaches through large-scale system-level simulations, including 3D map-based evaluations that reflect real-world urban environments. Our results demonstrate how carefully designed beamforming can balance communication throughput with sensing performance, achieving reliable coverage and efficient resource use even under severe near-field conditions. We conclude by highlighting open challenges in hardware, algorithms, and system integration, pointing toward research directions that will shape the deployment of 6G-ready ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>DIFNet: Decentralized Information Filtering Fusion Neural Network with Unknown Correlation in Sensor Measurement Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, decentralized sensor networks have garnered significant attention in the field of state estimation owing to enhanced robustness, scalability, and fault tolerance. Optimal fusion performance can be achieved under fully connected communication and known noise correlation structures. To mitigate communication overhead, the global state estimation problem is decomposed into local subproblems through structured observation model. This ensures that even when the communication network is not fully connected, each sensor can achieve locally optimal estimates of its observable state components. To address the degradation of fusion accuracy induced by unknown correlations in measurement noise, this paper proposes a data-driven method, termed Decentralized Information Filter Neural Network (DIFNet), to learn unknown noise correlations in data for discrete-time nonlinear state space models with cross-correlated measurement noises. Numerical simulations demonstrate that DIFNet achieves superior fusion performance compared to conventional filtering methods and exhibits robust characteristics in more complex scenarios, such as the presence of time-varying noise. The source code used in our numerical experiment can be found online at https://wisdom-estimation.github.io/DIFNet_Demonstrate/.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal RIS: Adversarial Channels and Optimality of Low-Complexity Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) have recently gained attention as an enhancement to conventional RISs. BD-RISs allow optimizing not only the phase, but also the amplitude responses of their discrete surface elements by introducing adjustable inter-element couplings. Various BD-RIS architectures have been proposed to optimally trade off between average performance and complexity of the architecture. However, little attention has been paid to worst-case performance. This paper characterizes novel sets of adversarial channels for which certain low-complexity BD-RIS architectures have suboptimal performance in terms of received signal power at an intended communications user. Specifically, we consider two recent BD-RIS models: the so-called group-connected and tree-connected architecture. The derived adversarial channel sets reveal new surprising connections between the two architectures. We validate our analytical results numerically, demonstrating that adversarial channels can cause a significant performance loss. Our results pave the way towards efficient BD-RIS designs that are robust to adversarial propagation conditions and malicious attacks.</description>

      <title>mmKey: Channel-Aware Beam Shaping for Reliable Key Generation in mmWave Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical-layer key generation (PLKG) has emerged as a promising technique to secure next-generation wireless networks by exploiting the inherent properties of the wireless channel. However, PLKG faces fundamental challenges in the millimeter wave (mmWave) regime due to channel sparsity, higher phase noise, and higher path loss, which undermine both the randomness and reciprocity required for secure key generation. In this paper, we present mmKey, a novel PLKG framework that capitalizes on the availability of multiple antennas at mmWave wireless nodes to inject randomness into an otherwise quasi-static wireless channel. Different from prior works that sacrifice either the secrecy of the key generation or the robustness, mmKey balances these two requirements. In particular, mmKey leverages a genetic algorithm to gradually evolve the initial weight vector population toward configurations that suppress the LOS component while taking into account the channel conditions, specifically, the sparsity and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Extensive simulations show that mmKey improves the secrecy gap by an average of 39.4% over random beamforming and 34.0% over null beamforming, outperforming conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>Fast Vortex Beam Alignment for OAM Mode Multiplexing in LOS MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM)-based communication systems offer high-capacity multiplexing in line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios; yet, their performance is sensitive to nodal misalignment, which disrupts modal orthogonality, hindering the data multiplexing gain. To tackle this challenge, we present OrthoVortex, a novel framework that estimates the misalignment angles and applies the appropriate phase correction to restore orthogonality between modes. Unlike purely theoretical prior efforts that rely on impractical fully digital arrays or exhaustive beam scans, OrthoVortex introduces and leverages the cross-modal phase, as a unique signature for identifying the misalignment angles. OrthoVortex is a few-shot alignment technique, making it feasible for real-world implementations. Our key contributions include: (i) a robust angle estimation and phase correction framework based on the physics of OAM propagation that estimates the misalignment and restores modal orthogonality, (ii) the first-ever experimental validation of OAM beam alignment with RF transceivers, and (iii) a comprehensive analysis of practical constraints, including the impact of antenna count and bandwidth. Simulations and over-the-air measurements using low-cost, rapidly prototyped metasurfaces operating at 120 GHz demonstrate that OrthoVortex achieves fast and precise misalignment estimation (mean absolute error of $0.69^{\circ}$ for azimuth and $2.54^{\circ}$ for elevation angle). Further, OrthoVortex can mitigate the inter-modal interference, yielding more than 12 dB increase in signal-to-interference ratio and more than 4.5-fold improvement in link capacity.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Coded RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems with Practical Reflection Models: Error Rate Analysis and Negative Moment-Based Optimization with Saddle Point Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RIS-assisted communication has recently attracted significant attention for enhancing wireless performance in challenging environments, making accurate error analysis under practical hardware constraints crucial for future multi-antenna systems. This paper presents a theoretical framework for SER analysis of RIS-assisted multiple antenna systems employing OSTBC under practical reflection models with amplitude-dependent and quantized phase responses. By exploiting the Gramian structure of the cascaded channel f, we derive exact MGF expressions of the nonzero eigenvalue of f'f for small RIS sizes. For large-scale RIS deployments, where closed-form analysis becomes intractable, we employ Saddle Point Approximation to approximate the eigenvalue distribution. Using these results, we derive unified SER expressions using exact and SPA-based MGF formulations, applicable to arbitrary RIS sizes, phase configuration, and both identical and non-identical amplitude responses. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy of the proposed SER expressions, demonstrating very close agreement for all configurations.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Polarimetry with Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetry, which is the ability to measure the scattering response of the environment across orthogonal polarizations, is fundamental to enhancing wireless communication and radar system performance. In this paper, we utilize the Zak-OTFS modulation to enable instantaneous polarimetry within a single transmission frame. We transmit a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform and a spread carrier waveform mutually unbiased to it simultaneously over orthogonal polarizations. The mutual unbiasedness of the two waveforms enables the receiver to estimate the full polarimetric response of the scattering environment from a single received frame. Unlike existing methods for instantaneous polarimetry with computational complexity quadratic in the time-bandwidth product, the proposed method enables instantaneous polarimetry at complexity that is only sublinear in the time-bandwidth product. Via numerical simulations, we show ideal polarimetric target detection and parameter estimation results with the proposed method, with improvements in performance and computational complexity over comparable baselines.</description>

      <title>Is Green Enough? A Remote Sensing Assessment of Environmental Impacts and Green Commitments at Beijing Daxing International Airport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beijing Daxing International Airport has been promoted as a model of green infrastructure under China's ecological modernization agenda. Featuring energy-efficient design, renewable energy systems, and smart environmental controls, the airport embodies multiple green commitments. This study evaluates its environmental outcomes using multi-source remote sensing data -- including NDVI, NDBI, Land Surface Temperature (LST), VIIRS night-time lights, and PM2.5 -- from 2014 to 2019. Through spatial and temporal comparisons, we assess landscape-level changes during and after construction. Findings indicate partial gains from green initiatives but also reveal substantial vegetation loss, increased built-up surfaces, and intensified surface temperatures. The results suggest a gap between sustainable design and ecological impact. We propose a remote-sensing-based framework for evaluating future infrastructure projects, emphasizing the need for spatially explicit, independent monitoring to ensure environmental accountability.</description>

      <title>Fast Multiagent Formation Stabilization with Sparse Universally Rigid Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine formation control (AFC) is a distributed networked control system that has recently received increasing attention in various applications. AFC is typically achieved using a generalized consensus system where the stress matrix, which encodes the graph structure, is used instead of a graph Laplacian. Universally rigid frameworks (URFs) guarantee the existence of the stress matrix and have thus become the guideline for such a network design. In this work, we propose a convex optimization framework to design the stress matrix for AFC without predefining a rigid graph. We aim to find a resulting network with a reduced number of communication links, but still with a fast convergence speed. We show through simulations that our proposed solutions can yield a more sparse graph, while admitting a faster convergence compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Joint Time-Position Statistics and Fisher Information in Drift-Diffusion Molecular Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a closed-form characterization of the joint distribution of first arrival time (FAT) and first arrival position (FAP) in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems with drift. Prior studies have investigated FAT modeling via inverse Gaussian distributions [1] and applied FAT statistics for parameter estimation and synchronization tasks [2], [3], while more recent work has characterized FAP for spatial channel analysis [4]. In contrast, we derive an explicit joint probability density function (PDF) under constant drift and isotropic diffusion in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Our result reveals a nontrivial coupling between arrival time and lateral position, generalizing known inverse Gaussian models. We further compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to key channel parameters, showing that the joint observation enables estimation of lateral drift and improves sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient -- capabilities not achievable with time-only or position-only models. This joint framework enhances the modeling and inference capabilities for molecular communication channels where spatial randomness itself carries non-negligible information.</description>

      <title>Improving Noise Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Router-Gated Cross-Modal Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11bn with Coordinated TDMA on Real-Time Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi plays a crucial role in connecting electronic devices and providing communication services in everyday life. Recently, there has been a growing demand for services that require low-latency communication, such as real-time applications. The latest amendments to Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11bn, are being developed to address these demands with technologies such as the multiple access point coordination (MAPC). In this paper, we demonstrate that coordinated TDMA (Co-TDMA), one of the MAPC techniques, effectively reduces the latency of transmitting time-sensitive traffic. In particular, we focus on worst-case latency and jitter, which are key metrics for evaluating the performance of real-time applications. We first introduce a Co-TDMA scheduling strategy. We then investigate how this scheduling strategy impacts latency under varying levels of network congestion and traffic volume characteristics. Finally, we validate our findings through system-level simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that Co-TDMA effectively mitigates jitter and worst-case latency for LL traffic, with the latter exhibiting an improvement of approximately 24%.</description>

      <title>Lossless 4:2:0 Screen Content Coding Using Luma-Guided Soft Context Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soft context formation coder is a pixel-wise state-of-the-art lossless screen content coder using pattern matching and color palette coding in combination with arithmetic coding. It achieves excellent compression performance on screen content images in RGB 4:4:4 format with few distinct colors. In contrast to many other lossless compression methods, it codes entire color pixels at once, i.e., all color components of one pixel are coded together. Consequently, it does not natively support image formats with downsampled chroma, such as YCbCr 4:2:0, which is an often used chroma format in video compression. In this paper, we extend the soft context formation coding capabilities to 4:2:0 image compression, by successively coding Y and CbCr planes based on an analysis of normalized mutual information between image planes. Additionally, we propose an enhancement to the chroma prediction based on the luminance plane. Furthermore, we propose to transmit side-information about occurring luma-chroma combinations to improve chroma probability distribution modelling. Averaged over a large screen content image dataset, our proposed method outperforms HEVC-SCC, with HEVC-SCC needing 5.66% more bitrate compared to our method.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Likelihood Estimation Based on Diffusion Model For Wireless Communications</title>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models, with their powerful feature learning capabilities, have been applied in many fields. In mobile wireless communications, GenAI can dynamically optimize the network to enhance the user experience. Especially in signal detection and channel estimation tasks, due to digital signals following a certain random distribution, GenAI models can fully utilize their distribution learning characteristics. For example, diffusion models (DMs) and normalized flow models have been applied to related tasks. However, since the DM cannot guarantee that the generated results are the maximum-likelihood estimation points of the distribution during the data generation process, the successful task completion rate is reduced. Based on this, this paper proposes a Maximum-Likelihood Estimation Inference (MLEI) framework. The framework uses the loss function in the forward diffusion process of the DM to infer the maximum-likelihood estimation points in the discrete space. Then, we present a signal detection task in near-field communication scenarios with unknown noise characteristics. In experiments, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework has better performance than state-of-the-art signal estimators.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Sounding in ISAC networks: Design and Implementation of a Multi-Node Testbed with Synchronized Airborne and Ground-Based Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities become more prevalent in the mobile 6G radio landscape, there is a substantial opportunity to enhance situational awareness across diverse applications through multi-static radar sensing within meshed ISAC networks. To facilitate the development and testing of detection and localization algorithms across diverse scenarios, this paper introduces a synchronized distributed channel sounding testbed with airborne and ground-based multi-channel transceiver nodes with centimeter-level positioning accuracy enabled by real-time kinematic (RTK) and inertial navigation system (INS) data. Our modular experimental measurement system is designed to include stationary sensor nodes and light-weight to medium-weight mobile nodes deployable on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), cars, pedestrians, and cyclists. Utilizing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, specifically software defined radios (SDRs), the testbed encourages reproducibility in academic research laboratories. We detail the individual modules and integration steps required to achieve the specified performance. The testbed's capabilities are validated through a real-world measurement campaign, including stationary and flying sensor nodes, aimed at detecting radar targets such as vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircrafts, small hexacopters, cars and vulnerable road users (VRUs) in air-to-air (A2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) scenarios.</description>

      <title>Decoding Saccadic Eye Movements from Brain Signals Using an Endovascular Neural Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left, right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze. The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast, classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.</description>

      <title>A Compact Dynamic Antenna for Physical Layer Wireless Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel omnidirectional antenna design incorporating directional modulation for secure narrow planar information transmission. The proposed antenna features a compact size and stable omnidirectional radiation performance by employing two tightly spaced, printed meander line monopole antennas, acting as a single radiating element. To achieve a narrow information secure region, the proposed antenna is fed by differential power excitation of two ports with real-time dynamic switching. This leads to phase pattern modulation only along the electrical polarization, resulting in directionally confined information recoverable region in the E-plane, while maintaining highly constant or static omnidirectional H-plane pattern, inducing a $360^\circ$ information recoverable region. The dynamic antenna is designed and fabricated on a single layer of Rogers RO4350B which provides a miniaturized planar size of $0.36 \times 0.5 , \lambda_0^2$ at 2.7 GHz and easy integration. To validate the wireless communication performance, the fabricated antenna is directly fed with a 10 dB power ratio by a radio frequency (RF) switching system and evaluated for 16-QAM and 256-QAM transmission in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that for 16-QAM transmission, a narrow E-plane information beam (IB) of approximately $34^\circ$ and omnidirectional H-plane IB are obtained, and a narrower E-plane IB is achieved around $15^\circ$ for 256-QAM. These results confirm that the proposed antenna offers a simple yet effective approach to enhance planar physical information security with a compact dynamic antenna system.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Location Calibration and Validation of Ray-Tracing Simulator NYURay at Upper Mid-Band Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins, enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by optimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and measured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Validation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT underestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.</description>

      <title>Improving the Spectral Efficiency of Zak-OTFS via Mutually Unbiased Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal signaling or Nyquist signaling limits the number of information symbols transmitted in bandwidth $B$ and time $T$ to be $BT$, the time-bandwidth product. Transmitting more than $BT$ symbols leads to loss of orthogonality. The standard approach is to reduce the symbol interval and resolve the resulting inter-symbol interference. This requires changing the sampling frequency and possibly the sampling clock. This paper shows that it is possible to improve spectral efficiency on doubly spread channels without changing the sampling frequency. The idea is to superimpose the information symbols using mutually unbiased bases (MUB) while maintaining the original spacing. We carry this out in the delay-Doppler domain using Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation as it allows construction of MUB. We also construct a precoder that mitigates the effect of the doubly-spread channel. This simplifies receiver processing to detection in Gaussian noise since each basis appears to the other as Gaussian noise. This reduction makes it possible to use trellis coded modulation to further improve the bit-error performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed signaling scheme using MUB achieves good bit-error performance.</description>
