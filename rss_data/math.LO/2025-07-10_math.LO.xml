      <title>A 2-categorical approach to the semantics of dependent type theory with computation axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axiomatic type theory is a dependent type theory without computation rules. The term equality judgements that usually characterise these rules are replaced by computation axioms, i.e., additional term judgements that are typed by identity types. This paper is devoted to providing an effective description of its semantics, from a higher categorical perspective: given the challenge of encoding intensional type formers into 1-dimensional categorical terms and properties, a challenge that persists even for axiomatic type formers, we adopt Richard Garner's approach in the 2-dimensional study of dependent types. We prove that the type formers of axiomatic theories can be encoded into natural 2-dimensional category theoretic data, obtaining a presentation of the semantics of axiomatic type theory via 2-categorical models called display map 2-categories. In the axiomatic case, the 2-categorical requirements identified by Garner for interpreting intensional type formers are relaxed. Therefore, we obtain a presentation of the semantics of the axiomatic theory that generalises Garner's one for the intensional case. Our main result states that the interpretation of axiomatic theories within display map 2-categories is well-defined and enjoys the soundness property. We use this fact to provide a semantic proof that the computation rule of intensional identity types is not admissible in axiomatic type theory. This is achieved via a revisitation of Hofmann and Streicher's groupoid model that believes axiomatic identity types but does not believe intensional ones.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tukey reducibility between $\sigma$-directed sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the pre-Tukey reducibility, a generalization of the Tukey reducibility between directed sets that works well in $\mathsf{ZF}$. We investigate the pre-Tukey reducibility between several $\sigma$-directed sets under assumptions on sets of reals, which hold in the Solovay model and in $L(\mathbb{R})$ satisfying $\mathsf{AD}$.</description>

      <title>On the lack of colimits in various categories of BAOs and Heyting algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that various categories of BAOs (boolean algebras with an operator) with stable morphisms between them are not cocomplete, and that neither are the category of Heyting algebras with bounded lattice morphisms, its full subcategory consisting of frames, and the category of frames with Heyting morphisms. As a consequence, none of these categories is equivalent to a prevariety of algebras, let alone a variety. In particular, we obtain that the category of McKinsey-Tarski algebras is not equivalent to a variety, thus answering a question by Peter Jipsen in the negative.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-like theorems for separable permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a computability-theoretic study of Ramsey-like theorems of the form "Every coloring of the edges of an infinite clique admits an infinite sub-clique avoiding some pattern", with a particular focus on transitive patterns. As it turns out, the patterns corresponding to separable permutations play an important role in the computational features of the statement. We prove that the avoidance of any separable permutation is equivalent to the existence of an infinite homogeneous set in standard models, while this property fails for any other pattern. For this, we develop a novel argument for relativized diagonal non-computation.</description>

      <title>Hyper-u-amenablity and Hyperfiniteness of Treeable Equivalence Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of u-amenability and hyper-u-amenability for countable Borel equivalence relations, strong forms of amenability that are implied by hyperfiniteness. We show that treeable, hyper-u-amenable countable Borel equivalence relations are hyperfinite. One of the corollaries that we get is that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is measure-hyperfinite and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a free continuous action of a free group (with $k \ge 2$ or $k = \infty$ generators) on a $\sigma$-compact Polish space, then it is hyperfinite. We also obtain that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is treeable and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a Borel action of an amenable group on a standard Borel space, or if it is treeable, amenable and Borel bounded, then it is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence and diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let two smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$ be given, with $M$ closed and connected. If the $C^r$--diffeomorphism group of $M$ is elementarily equivalent to the $C^s$--diffeomorphism group of $N$ for some $r,s\in[1,\infty)\cup\{0,\infty\}$, then $r=s$ and $M$ and $N$ are $C^r$--xdiffeomorphic. This strengthens a previously known result by Takens and Filipkiewicz, which implies that a group isomorphism between diffeomorphism groups of closed manifolds necessarily arises from a diffeomorphism of the underlying manifolds, provided the regularity lies in $\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$. We prove an analogous result for groups of diffeomorphisms preserving smooth volume forms, in dimension at least two.</description>

      <title>Generalised ultracategories and conceptual completeness of geometric logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the theory of generalised ultracategories, these are relational extensions to ultracategories as defined by Lurie. An essential example of generalised ultracategories are topological spaces, and these play a fundamental role in the theory of generalised ultracategories. Another example of these generalised ultracategories is points of toposes. In this paper, we show a conceptual completeness theorem for toposes with enough points, stating that any such topos can be reconstructed from its generalised ultracategory of points. This is done by considering left ultrafunctors from topological spaces to the category of points and paralleling this construction with another known fundamental result in topos theory, namely that any topos with enough points is a colimit of a topological groupoid.</description>

      <title>Separably differentially closed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of differential fields in positive characteristic. We call them separably differentially closed fields and demonstrate that they are the differential analogue of separably closed fields. We prove several (algebraic and model-theoretic) properties of this class. Among other things, we show that it is an elementary class, whose theory we denote $\SDCF$, and that its completions are determined by specifying the characteristic $p$ and the differential degree of imperfection $\epsilon$. Furthermore, after adding what we call the differential $\lambda$-functions, we prove that the theory $\SDCFl$ admits quantifier elimination, is stable, and prime model extensions exist.</description>

      <title>Intermediate models and Kinna--Wagner Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinna--Wagner Principles state that every set can be mapped into some fixed iterated power set of an ordinal, and we write $\mathsf{KWP}$ to denote that there is some $\alpha$ for which this holds. The Kinna--Wagner Conjecture, formulated by the first author in [9], states that if $V$ is a model of $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{KWP}$ and $G$ is a $V$-generic filter, then whenever $W$ is an intermediate model of $\mathsf{ZF}$, that is $V\subseteq W\subseteq V[G]$, then $W=V(x)$ for some $x$ if and only if $W$ satisfies $\mathsf{KWP}$. In this work we prove the conjecture and generalise it even further. We include a brief historical overview of Kinna--Wagner Principles and new results about Kinna--Wagner Principles in the multiverse of sets.</description>

      <title>Finite models for positive combinatorial and exponential algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use high girth, high chromatic number hypergraphs to show that there are finite models of the equational theory of the semiring of nonnegative integers whose equational theory has no finite axiomatisation, and show this also holds if factorial, fixed base exponentiation and operations for binomial coefficients are adjoined. We also derive the decidability of the equational logical entailment operator $\vdash$ for antecedents true on $\mathbb{N}$ by way of a form of the finite model property.
  Two appendices contain additional basic development of combinatorial operations. Amongst the observations are an eventual dominance well-ordering of combinatorial functions and consequent representation of the ordinal $\epsilon_0$ in terms of factorial functions; the equivalence of the equational logic of combinatorial algebra over the natural numbers and over the positive reals; and a candidate list of elementary axioms.</description>
