      <title>Prediction of Spallation Induced Transmutation Rates For Long Lived Fission Products via Proton Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long lived fission products represent a major challenge in nuclear waste management due to persistent radiotoxicity over very long timescales. This study focuses on six of these fission products: Se-79, Zr-93, Tc-99, Sn-126, I-127, Cs-135. This study investigates the feasibility of spallation driven transmutation, in which a high energy proton beam strikes a heavy spallation target to generate neutrons that induce transmutation in the fission products surrounding the target. Lead and depleted uranium are identified as the principal spallation target candidates, reflecting contrasting trade offs in neutron yield, secondary reactions, and heat generation. Simulations assess nuclide specific behavior under reactor scale inventories and practical geometric constraints. Results demonstrate that technetium, iodine, and selenium are strong candidates for transmutation using this pathway, while tin shows partial resistance but benefits from thermal flux. By contrast, zirconium is neutron transparent and inefficient to transmute, and cesium suffers from low net reduction due to competition with lighter isotopes. Cost effectiveness is highly isotope dependent: technetium is most favorable, whereas cesium and zirconium remain expensive. These findings highlight the advantages and limitations of spallation driven systems and motivate strategies with optimized target-blanket designs.</description>

      <title>SPARTA: Python-Based Automated Spectral Parameter Analysis and Assessment System for Resonance Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining resonance frequencies and quality factors (Q) is crucial in accelerator physics and radiofrequency engineering, as these factors have direct impacts on system design, operational stability, and research results. The methods currently employed to facilitate resonance analysis are mostly manual, requiring operators and physicists to estimate resonant parameters and examine scattering parameter (S-parameter) data from vector network analyzers (VNAs). The current techniques therefore become laborious, operator-dependent and challenging to replicate when applied to large datasets or across multiple analyses. Despite the importance of these tasks for high-volume research organizations such as CERN where S-parameter measurements are regularly taken for cavity and beam diagnostic research, the currently widespread measures are outdated.
  In order to automate the laborious resonance characterization process, this paper presents SPARTA (Spectral Parameter Analysis for Resonance Tracking and Assessment), a data analysis software framework based on Python. SPARTA has integrated data ingestion, preprocessing, resonance detection, quality factor estimation, visualization and persistent cloud storage into a reproducible and scalable workflow. SPARTA was developed with the scientific libraries NumPy, SciPy and scikit-rf for accurate and efficient numerical processing, Flask and Dash for interactive and lightweight visualization, and SQLite for easy database management. The three main contributions of this work are outlined as follows: Firstly, this paper presents a methodological framework for resonance detection and assessment based on established RF theory. The second section describes the system architecture and implementation of SPARTA, highlighting data handling, computation and visualization. Finally this paper discusses the results and advantages of automated analysis.</description>

      <title>Short-Pulse High-Power THz Generation Using Optical Klystron FELs: Simulation Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of extending the optical klystron (OK) concept into the terahertz (THz) regime, where strong radiation slippage and diffraction fundamentally challenge efficient free- electron laser (FEL) operation. Numerical simulations were carried out for resonant wavelengths of 10, 30, and 100 {\mu}m using parameters relevant to the planned DALI facility. The results show that while long wavelengths exhibit rapid energy growth, they suffer from significant temporal broadening due to slippage, whereas shorter wavelengths require large dispersive strengths R56 to achieve sufficient bunching. Harmonic bunching is demonstrated as a viable alternative to reduce the required R56 at short wavelengths. Diffraction was analyzed and found not to limit the present design, as the radiation spot size remains well within the beamline aperture. To address the slippage challenge, we propose and numerically demonstrate a novel chicane-embedded optical delay scheme, which restores phase alignment between the radiation and microbunched electrons. Simulations confirm that careful tuning of the dispersive strengths allows staged amplification, preserving beam quality and reaching multi-megawatt output power. These results highlight the potential of THz- tailored optical klystrons to generate compact, short, and high-intensity THz pulses, and lay the groundwork for future experimental studies and facility implementation.</description>

      <title>A note on thermal effects in non-linear models for plasma-based acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a non-negligible background temperature on relativistic plasma wakefields generated when a beam of charged particles passes through a neutral plasma at rest. Our analysis focuses on the blowout regime, where the plasma response is highly non-linear: plasma electrons are radially blown out and expelled away from the propagation axis of the beam particles, creating a region (bubble) of ions without electrons. Our study builds upon earlier investigations for non-linear models of plasma wakefields developed neglecting plasma temperature. In the presence of a non-zero background temperature, we characterize the bubble in terms of its transversal and longitudinal sizes as a function of the temperature. Model predictions and parametrizations are studied in combination with PIC simulations, and correctly reproduce the temperature induced contraction of both the longitudinal and transverse bubble sizes.</description>
