      <title>Optimal Procurement Design: A Reduced Form Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard procurement models assume that the buyer knows the quality of the good at the time of procurement; however, in many settings, the quality is learned only long after the transaction. We study procurement problems in which the buyer's valuation of the supplied good depends directly on its quality, which is unverifiable and unobservable to the buyer. For a broad class of procurement problems, we identify procurement mechanisms maximizing any weighted average of the buyer's expected payoff and social surplus. The optimal mechanism can be implemented by an auction that restricts sellers to submit bids within specific intervals.</description>

      <title>Barter and Hierarchy: A Practical Perspective on Food, Society, and Knowledge in the Inca Empire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Inca Empire developed a sophisticated food production system, social organisation, and knowledge transmission without money or writing. The article introduces the concept of a barter economy structured through hierarchical cooperation and examines the Inca model from a practice-based (heuristical) perspective.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian Approach to Optimal Lotteries in Non-Convex Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new method to efficiently solve for optimal lotteries in models with non-convexities. In order to employ a Lagrangian framework, we prove that the value of the saddle point that characterizes the optimal lottery is the same as the value of the dual of the deterministic problem. Our algorithm solves the dual of the deterministic problem via sub-gradient descent. We prove that the optimal lottery can be directly computed from the deterministic optima that occur along the iterations. We analyze the computational complexity of our algorithm and show that the worst-case complexity is often orders of magnitude better than the one arising from a linear programming approach. We apply the method to two canonical problems with private information. First, we solve a principal-agent moral-hazard problem, demonstrating that our approach delivers substantial improvements in speed and scalability over traditional linear programming methods. Second, we study an optimal taxation problem with hidden types, which was previously considered computationally infeasible, and examine under which conditions the optimal contract will involve lotteries.</description>

      <title>Does Your Blockchain Need Multidimensional Transaction Fees?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchains have block-size limits to ensure the entire cluster can keep up with the tip of the chain. These block-size limits are usually single-dimensional, but richer multidimensional constraints allow for greater throughput. The potential for performance improvements from multidimensional resource pricing has been discussed in the literature, but exactly how big those performance improvements are remains unclear. In order to identify the magnitude of additional throughput that multi-dimensional transaction fees can unlock, we introduce the concept of an $\alpha$-approximation. A constraint set $C_1$ is $\alpha$-approximated by $C_2$ if every block feasible under $C_1$ is also feasible under $C_2$ once all resource capacities are scaled by a factor of $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha =2$ corresponds to doubling all available resources). We show that the $\alpha$-approximation of the optimal single-dimensional gas measure corresponds to the value of a specific zero-sum game. However, the more general problem of finding the optimal $k$-dimensional approximation is NP-complete. Quantifying the additional throughput that multi-dimensional fees can provide allows blockchain designers to make informed decisions about whether the additional capacity unlocked by multidimensional constraints is worth the additional complexity they add to the protocol.</description>

      <title>COWPEA (Candidates Optimally Weighted in Proportional Election using Approval voting)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08857v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes COWPEA (Candidates Optimally Weighted in Proportional Election using Approval voting), a method of proportional representation that uses approval voting, also known as random priority, though underdeveloped in the literature. COWPEA optimally elects an unlimited number of candidates with potentially different weights to a body, rather than giving a fixed number equal weight. A non-deterministic Approval-Based Committee (ABC) version that elects a fixed a number of candidates with equal weight is known as COWPEA Lottery. This is the only method known to pass the criteria of monotonicity, strong candidate Pareto efficiency, Independence of Irrelevant Ballots, and Independence of Unanimously Approved Candidates. It is also possible to convert COWPEA and COWPEA Lottery to score or graded voting methods. COWPEA and COWPEA Lottery are also compared against Optimal PAV and Optimal PAV Lottery.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Clones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models, trained on personal data, may soon be able to mimic individual personalities. These ``AI clones'' or ``AI agents'' have the potential to transform how people search over one another in contexts ranging from marriage to employment -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun using AI clones to evaluate potential pairings between users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones, and their imperfect representation of humans. Individual personalities are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations of these personalities. I compare two search regimes: an ``in-person regime'' -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an ``AI representation regime'' -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a better expected match than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</description>
