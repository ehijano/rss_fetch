      <title>From a Tiny Slip to a Giant Leap: An LLM-Based Simulation for Fake News Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing spread of misinformation online, research has increasingly focused on detecting and tracking fake news. However, an overlooked issue is that fake news does not naturally exist in social networks -- it often originates from distorted facts or deliberate fabrication by malicious actors. Understanding how true news gradually evolves into fake news is critical for early detection and prevention, reducing its spread and impact. Hence, in this paper, we take the first step toward simulating and revealing this evolution, proposing a Fake News evolUtion Simulation framEwork (FUSE) based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we employ LLM as agents to represent individuals in a simulated social network. We define four types of agents commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders, who propagate information; commentators, who provide opinions and interpretations; verifiers, who check the accuracy of information; and bystanders, who passively observe without engaging. For simulated environments, we model various social network structures, such as high-clustering networks and scale-free networks, to mirror real-world network dynamics. Each day, the agents engage in belief exchanges, reflect on their thought processes, and reintroduce the news accordingly. Given the lack of prior work in this area, we developed a FUSE-EVAL evaluation framework to measure the deviation from true news during the fake news evolution process. The results show that FUSE successfully captures the underlying patterns of how true news transforms into fake news and accurately reproduces previously discovered instances of fake news, aligning closely with human evaluations. Moreover, our work provides insights into the fact that combating fake news should not be delayed until it has fully evolved; instead, prevention in advance is key to achieving better outcomes.</description>

      <title>Sentiment-Driven Community Detection in a Network of Perfume Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19177v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network analysis is increasingly important across various fields, including the fragrance industry, where perfumes are represented as nodes and shared user preferences as edges in perfume networks. Community detection can uncover clusters of similar perfumes, providing insights into consumer preferences, enhancing recommendation systems, and informing targeted marketing strategies.
  This study aims to apply community detection techniques to group perfumes favored by users into relevant clusters for better recommendations. We constructed a bipartite network from user reviews on the Persian retail platform "Atrafshan," with nodes representing users and perfumes, and edges formed by positive comments. This network was transformed into a Perfume Co-Preference Network, connecting perfumes liked by the same users. By applying community detection algorithms, we identified clusters based on shared preferences, enhancing our understanding of user sentiment in the fragrance market.
  To improve sentiment analysis, we integrated emojis and a user voting system for greater accuracy. Emojis, aligned with their Persian counterparts, captured the emotional tone of reviews, while user ratings for scent, longevity, and sillage refined sentiment classification. Edge weights were adjusted by combining adjacency values with user ratings in a 60:40 ratio, reflecting both connection strength and user preferences. These enhancements led to improved modularity of detected communities, resulting in more accurate perfume groupings.
  This research pioneers the use of community detection in perfume networks, offering new insights into consumer preferences. Our advancements in sentiment analysis and edge weight refinement provide actionable insights for optimizing product recommendations and marketing strategies in the fragrance industry.</description>

      <title>Making Social Platforms Accessible: Emotion-Aware Speech Generation with Integrated Text Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have outlined the accessibility challenges faced by blind or visually impaired, and less-literate people, in interacting with social networks, in-spite of facilitating technologies such as monotone text-to-speech (TTS) screen readers and audio narration of visual elements such as emojis. Emotional speech generation traditionally relies on human input of the expected emotion together with the text to synthesise, with additional challenges around data simplification (causing information loss) and duration inaccuracy, leading to lack of expressive emotional rendering. In real-life communications, the duration of phonemes can vary since the same sentence might be spoken in a variety of ways depending on the speakers' emotional states or accents (referred to as the one-to-many problem of text to speech generation). As a result, an advanced voice synthesis system is required to account for this unpredictability. We propose an end-to-end context-aware Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis system that derives the conveyed emotion from text input and synthesises audio that focuses on emotions and speaker features for natural and expressive speech, integrating advanced natural language processing (NLP) and speech synthesis techniques for real-time applications. Our system also showcases competitive inference time performance when benchmarked against the state-of-the-art TTS models, making it suitable for real-time accessibility applications.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Social Tie Strength: Definitions, Prediction Methods, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of online social networks has underscored the importance of understanding the intensity of user relationships, referred to as "tie strength." Over the past few decades, extensive efforts have been made to assess tie strength in networks. However, the lack of ground-truth tie strength labels and the differing perspectives on tie strength among researchers have complicated the development of effective prediction methods for real-world applications. In our study, we first categorize mainstream understandings of tie strength into seven standardized definitions and verify their effectiveness by investigating the class distributions and correlations across these definitions. We also draw key insights into tie resilience from the perspective of tie dissolution that (1) stronger ties are more resilient than weaker ones, and (2) this tie resiliency ratio increases as the network evolves. We then conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing tie strength prediction methods under these definitions, revealing that (1) neural network methods capable of learning from semantic features hold great potential for high performance, (2) models struggle under definitions that offer limited understandings of tie strength in the network, (3) existing models face imbalance issues that cannot be addressed by traditional quantity imbalance techniques, and (4) different definitions of tie strength allow for the inference of not only the current state but also the future state of a tie. Building on these findings, we propose strategies to improve existing methods and suggest several promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Beyond One Solution: The Case for a Comprehensive Exploration of Solution Space in Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the importance of examining the solution space in community detection, highlighting its role in achieving reliable results when dealing with real-world problems. A Bayesian framework is used to estimate the stability of the solution space and classify it into categories Single, Dominant, Multiple, Sparse or Empty. By applying this approach to real-world networks, the study highlights the importance of considering multiple solutions rather than relying on a single partition. This ensures more reliable results and efficient use of computational resources in community detection analysis.</description>

      <title>Mapping leadership and communities in EU-funded research through network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe the EU programs supporting research and innovation through collaboration between companies, academic institutions, and research organisations. This paper introduces a novel methodology using open data on Horizon programs to analyse collaborations, leadership roles, and their evolution, with a focus on the North Adriatic Hydrogen Valley project in the hydrogen energy sector.
  The methodology employs network analysis, transforming tabular data into weighted networks that represent collaborations between organisations. Centrality measures and community detection algorithms identify influential organisations and stable partnerships over time. To ensure robust and reliable results, the methodology addresses challenges such as input-ordering bias and result variability, while the exploration of the solution space enhances the accuracy of identified collaboration patterns.
  The case study reveals key leaders and stable communities within the hydrogen energy sector, providing valuable insights for policymakers and organisations fostering innovation through sustained collaborations. The proposed methodology effectively identifies influential organisations and tracks the stability of research collaborations. The insights gained are valuable for policymakers and organisations seeking to foster innovation through sustained partnerships. This approach can be extended to other sectors, offering a framework for understanding the impact of EU research funding on collaboration and leadership dynamics.</description>

      <title>Community detection on directed networks with missing edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying significant community structures in networks with incomplete data is a challenging task, as the reliability of solutions diminishes with increasing levels of missing information. However, in many empirical contexts, some information about the uncertainty in the network measurements can be estimated. In this work, we extend the recently developed Flow Stability framework, originally designed for detecting communities in time-varying networks, to address the problem of community detection in weighted, directed networks with missing links. Our approach leverages known uncertainty levels in nodes' out-degrees to enhance the robustness of community detection. Through comparisons on synthetic networks and a real-world network of messaging channels on the Telegram platform, we demonstrate that our method delivers more reliable community structures, even when a significant portion of data is missing.</description>

      <title>A Test of Time: Predicting the Sustainable Success of Online Collaboration in Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet has significantly expanded the potential for global collaboration, allowing millions of users to contribute to collective projects like Wikipedia. While prior work has assessed the success of online collaborations, most approaches are time-agnostic, evaluating success without considering its longevity. Research on the factors that ensure the long-term preservation of high-quality standards in online collaboration is scarce. In this study, we address this gap. We propose a novel metric, `Sustainable Success,' which measures the ability of collaborative efforts to maintain their quality over time. Using Wikipedia as a case study, we introduce the SustainPedia dataset, which compiles data from over 40K Wikipedia articles, including each article's sustainable success label and more than 300 explanatory features such as edit history, user experience, and team composition. Using this dataset, we develop machine learning models to predict the sustainable success of Wikipedia articles. Our best-performing model achieves a high AU-ROC score of 0.88 on average. Our analysis reveals important insights. For example, we find that the longer an article takes to be recognized as high-quality, the more likely it is to maintain that status over time (i.e., be sustainable). Additionally, user experience emerged as the most critical predictor of sustainability. Our analysis provides insights into broader collective actions beyond Wikipedia (e.g., online activism, crowdsourced open-source software), where the same social dynamics that drive success on Wikipedia might play a role. We make all data and code used for this study publicly available for further research.</description>

      <title>Enriching GNNs with Text Contextual Representations for Detecting Disinformation Campaigns on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disinformation on social media poses both societal and technical challenges. While previous studies have integrated textual information into propagation networks, they have yet to fully leverage the advancements in Transformer-based language models for high-quality contextual text representations. This work investigates the impact of incorporating textual features into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fake news detection. Our experiments demonstrate that contextual representations improve performance by 9.3% in Macro F1 over static ones and 33.8% over GNNs without textual features. However, noisy data augmentation degrades performance and increases instability. We expect our methodology to open avenues for further research, and all code is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Non-Submodularity: Constant Approximation for Network Immunization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a network with an ongoing epidemic, the network immunization problem seeks to identify a fixed number of nodes to immunize in order to maximize the number of infections prevented. One of the fundamental computational challenges in network immunization is that the objective function is generally neither submodular nor supermodular. As a result, no efficient algorithm is known to consistently find a solution with a constant approximation guarantee. Traditionally, this problem is addressed using proxy objectives, which offer better approximation properties. However, converting to these indirect optimizations often introduces losses in effectiveness. In this paper, we overcome these fundamental barriers by utilizing the underlying stochastic structures of the diffusion process. Similar to the traditional influence objective, the immunization objective is an expectation that can be expressed as the sum of objectives over deterministic instances. However, unlike the former, some of these terms are not submodular. The key step is proving that this sum has a bounded deviation from submodularity, thereby enabling the greedy algorithm to achieve constant factor approximation. We show that this approximation still stands considering a variety of immunization settings and spread models.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Reply Attacks in Influence Operations: Characterization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinated reply attacks are a tactic observed in online influence operations and other coordinated campaigns to support or harass targeted individuals, or influence them or their followers. Despite its potential to influence the public, past studies have yet to analyze or provide a methodology to detect this tactic. In this study, we characterize coordinated reply attacks in the context of influence operations on Twitter. Our analysis reveals that the primary targets of these attacks are influential people such as journalists, news media, state officials, and politicians.
  We propose two supervised machine-learning models, one to classify tweets to determine whether they are targeted by a reply attack, and one to classify accounts that reply to a targeted tweet to determine whether they are part of a coordinated attack. The classifiers achieve AUC scores of 0.88 and 0.97, respectively. These results indicate that accounts involved in reply attacks can be detected, and the targeted accounts themselves can serve as sensors for influence operation detection.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Silence in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the classic multi-agent DeGroot model for opinion dynamics to incorporate the Spiral of Silence theory from political science. This theory states that individuals may withhold their opinions when they perceive them to be in the minority. As in the DeGroot model, a community of agents is represented as a weighted directed graph whose edges indicate how much agents influence one another. However, agents whose current opinions are in the minority become silent (i.e., they do not express their opinion). Two models for opinion update are then introduced. In the memoryless opinion model ($\mbox{SOM}^-$), agents update their opinion by taking the weighted average of their non-silent neighbors' opinions. In the memory based opinion model ($\mbox{SOM}^+$), agents update their opinions by taking the weighted average of the opinions of all their neighbors, but for silent neighbors, their most recent opinion is considered.
  We show that for $\mbox{SOM}^-$ convergence to consensus is guaranteed for clique graphs but, unlike for the classic DeGroot, not guaranteed for strongly-connected aperiodic graphs. In contrast, we show that for $\mbox{SOM}^+$ convergence to consensus is not guaranteed even for clique graphs. We showcase our models through simulations offering experimental insights that align with key aspects of the Spiral of Silence theory. These findings reveal the impact of silence dynamics on opinion formation and highlight the limitations of consensus in more nuanced social models.</description>

      <title>Bayan Algorithm: Detecting Communities in Networks Through Exact and Approximate Optimization of Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04562v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection is a classic network problem with extensive applications in various fields. Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A Python implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for Python.</description>

      <title>MiniFed : Integrating LLM-based Agentic-Workflow for Simulating FOMC Meeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Federal Funds rate in the United States plays a significant role in both domestic and international financial markets. However, research has predominantly focused on the effects of adjustments to the Federal Funds rate rather than on the decision-making process itself. Recent advancements in large language models(LLMs) offer a potential method for reconstructing the original FOMC meetings, which are responsible for setting the Federal Funds rate. In this paper, we propose a five-stage FOMC meeting simulation framework, MiniFed, which employs LLM agents to simulate real-world FOMC meeting members and optimize the FOMC structure. This framework effectively revitalizes the FOMC meeting process and facilitates projections of the Federal Funds rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MiniFed framework achieves both high accuracy in Federal Funds rate projections and behavioral alignment with the agents' real-world counterparts.
