      <title>Continuity of the solution map of some active scalar equations in H\"older and Zygmund spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the solution map for a family of non-linear transport equations in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with a velocity field given by the convolution of the density with a kernel that is smooth away from the origin and homogeneous of degree $-(n-1)$, is continuous in both the little H\"older class and the little Zygmund class. For particular choices of the kernel, one recovers well-known equations such as the 2D Euler or the 3D quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>

      <title>Bounds on unstable spectrum for dispersive Hamiltonian PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasi-periodic eigenvalue problems that arise in the stability analysis of periodic traveling wave solutions to Hamiltonian PDEs. We establish bounds on regions in the complex plane when the eigenvalues may deviate from the imaginary axis, and estimates for the number of such off-axis eigenvalues. These relations hold when the dispersion relation grows sufficiently rapidly in the wavenumber. The proofs involve a Gershgorin disk argument together with the Hamiltonian symmetry of the spectrum. The results are applicable to a broad class of nonlinear dispersive equations including the generalized Korteweg--de Vries, Benjamin--Bona--Mahoney, and Kawanhara equations.</description>

      <title>Global Calder\'on-Zygmund theory for fractional Laplacian type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish several fine boundary regularity results of weak solutions to non-homogeneous $s$-fractional Laplacian type equations. In particular, we prove sharp Calder\'on-Zygmund type estimates of $u/d^s$ depending on the regularity assumptions on the associated kernel coefficient including VMO, Dini continuity or the H\"older continuity, where $u$ is a weak solution to such a nonlocal problem and $d$ is the distance to the boundary function of a given domain. Our analysis is based on point-wise behaviors of maximal functions of $u/d^s$.</description>

      <title>Negative regularity mixing for random volume preserving diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the negative regularity mixing properties of random volume preserving diffeomorphisms on a compact manifold without boundary. We give general criteria so that the associated random transfer operator mixes $H^{-\delta}$ observables exponentially fast in $H^{-\delta}$ (with a deterministic rate), a property that is false in the deterministic setting. The criteria apply to a wide variety of random diffeomorphisms, such as discrete-time iid random diffeomorphisms, the solution maps of suitable classes of stochastic differential equations, and to the case of advection-diffusion by solutions of the stochastic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb T^2$. In the latter case, we show that the zero diffusivity passive scalar with a stochastic source possesses a unique stationary measure describing "ideal" scalar turbulence. The proof is based on techniques inspired by the use of pseudodifferential operators and anisotropic Sobolev spaces in the deterministic setting.</description>

      <title>Local regularity and finite-time singularity for a class of generalized SQG patches on the half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of inviscid generalized surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equations on the half-plane with a rigid boundary. Compared to the Biot-Savart law in the vorticity form of the 2D Euler equation, the velocity formula here includes an additional Fourier multiplier operator $m(\Lambda)$. When $m(\Lambda) = \Lambda^\alpha$, where $\Lambda = (-\Delta)^{1/2}$ and $\alpha\in (0,2)$, the equation reduces to the well-known $\alpha$-SQG equation. Finite-time singularity formation for patch solutions to the $\alpha$-SQG equation was famously discovered by Kiselev, Ryzhik, Yao, and Zlato\v{s} [Ann. Math., 184 (2016), pp. 909-948].
  We establish finite-time singularity formation for patch solutions to the generalized SQG equations under the Osgood condition \[\int_2^\infty \frac{1}{r (\log r) m(r)} dr &lt; \infty\] along with some additional mild conditions. Notably, our result fills the gap between the globally well-posed 2D Euler equation ($\alpha = 0$) and the $\alpha$-SQG equation ($\alpha &gt; 0$). Furthermore, in line with Elgindi's global regularity results for 2D Loglog-Euler type equations [Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal., 211 (2014), pp. 965-990], our findings suggest that the Osgood condition serves as a sharp threshold that distinguishes global regularity and finite-time singularity in these models.
  In addition, we generalize the local regularity and finite-time singularity results for patch solutions to the $\alpha$-SQG equation, as established by Gancedo and Patel [Ann. PDE, 7 (2021), no. 1, Art. no. 4], extending them to cases where $m(r)$ behaves like $r^\alpha$ near infinity but does not have an explicit formulation.</description>

      <title>The Trudinger type inequality in fractional boundary Hardy inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Trudinger-type inequality in the context of fractional boundary Hardy-type inequality for the case $sp=d$, where $p&gt;1, ~ s \in (0,1)$ on a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we establish fractional version of Trudinger-type inequality with an extra singular function, namely $d$-th power of the distance function from $\partial \Omega$ in the denominator of the integrand. The case $d=1$, as it falls in the category $sp=1$, becomes more delicate where an extra logarithmic correction is required together with substraction of an average term.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansion for a class of second-order evolution equations in the energy space and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly discuss asymptotic profiles of solutions to a class of abstract second-order evolution equations of the form $u''+Au+u'=0$ in real Hilbert spaces, where $A$ is a nonnegative selfadjoint operator. The main result is the asymptotic expansion for all initial data belonging to the energy space, which is naturally expected. This is an improvement for the previous work (required a sufficient regularity). As an application, we focus our attention to damped wave equations in an exterior domain in $\mathbb{R^N (N \geq 2)$ with the Dirichlet boundary condition. By using the asymptotic expansion in the present paper, we could derive the optimal decay rates of energy functional of solutions to damped wave equations. Moreover, some decay estimates of the local energy (energy functional restricted in a compact subset) can be observed via the asymptotic expansion.</description>

      <title>A comparison principle based on couplings of partial integro-differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a comparison principle for viscosity solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ), -Bellman (HJB), and -Isaacs (HJI) equations for general classes of partial integro-differential operators. Our approach innovates in three ways: (1) We reinterpret the classical doubling-of-variables method in the context of second-order equations by casting the Ishii-Crandall Lemma into a test function framework. This adaptation allows us to effectively handle non-local integral operators, such as those associated with L\'evy processes. (2) We translate the key estimate on the difference of Hamiltonians in terms of an adaptation of the probabilistic notion of couplings, providing a unified approach that applies to differential, difference, and integral operators. (3) We strengthen the sup-norm contractivity resulting from the comparison principle to one that encodes continuity in the strict topology. We apply our theory to a variety of examples, in particular, to second-order differential operators and, more generally, generators of spatially inhomogeneous L\'evy processes.</description>

Abstract: We are concerned with the mixed local/nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger equation
  \begin{equation}

      <description>arXiv:2410.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the study of a non-local Cahn-Hilliard-type singularly perturbed family of functionals is undertaken, generalizing known results by Alberti &amp; Bellettini. The kernels considered include those leading to Gagliardo seminorms for fractional Sobolev spaces. The limit energy is computed via $\Gamma$-convergence and shown to be an anisotropic surface energy on the interface between the two phases.</description>

      <title>Generalized dissipative solutions to free boundary compressible viscous models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study free boundary compressible viscous models that may include nonlinear viscosities. These are compressible/incompressible Navier-Stokes type systems for a non-Newtonian stress tensor. They describe the motion of a possibly non-Newtonian fluid in free flow and in congested regions. In the congested regions it appears the pressure that is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the incompressibility constraint, while in free flows it is a pressureless gas system. We establish the existence of generalized dissipative solutions in the case of in/out-flow boundary conditions and we also prove that if these solutions are smooth then they are classical solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a theoretical analysis of a one-dimensional heat transfer problem in two layers involving diffusion, advection, internal heat generation or loss linearly dependent on temperature in each layer, and heat generation due to external sources. Additionally, the thermal resistance at the interface between the materials is considered. The situation of interest is modeled mathematically, explicit analytical solutions are found using Fourier techniques, and a convergent finite difference scheme is formulated to simulate specific cases. The solution is consistent with previous results. A numerical example is included that shows coherence between the obtained results and the physics of the problem. The conclusions drawn in this work expand the theoretical understanding of two-layer heat transfer and may also contribute to improving the thermal design of multilayer engineering systems.</description>

Abstract: We remove the dependence on the `hot-spots' conjecture in two of the main theorems of the recent paper of Nickl (2024, Annals of Statistics). Specifically, we characterise the minimax convergence rates for estimation of the transition operator $P_{f}$ arising from the Neumann Laplacian with diffusion coefficient $f$ on arbitrary convex domains with smooth boundary, and further show that a general Lipschitz stability estimate holds for the inverse map $P_f\mapsto f$ from $H^2\to H^2$ to $L^1$.</description>

Abstract: Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is an important instability mechanism for rotating flows with magnetic fields. In particular, when the strength of the magnetic field tends to zero, the stability criterion for rotating flows is generally different from the classical Rayleigh criterion for rotating flows without a magnetic field. MRI has wide applications in astrophysics, particularly to the turbulence and enhanced angular momentum transport in accretion disks. For the case of vertical magnetic fields, we give rigorous proof of linear MRI and a complete description of the spectra and semigroup growth of the linearized operator. Moreover, we prove nonlinear stability and instability from the sharp linear stability/instability criteria.</description>

      <title>A New Convex Integration Approach for the Compressible Euler Equations and Failure of the Local Maximal Dissipation Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a new convex integration approach for the barotropic compressible Euler equations in two space dimensions. In contrast to existing literature, our new method generates not only the momentum for given density, but also the energy and the energy flux. This allows for a simple way to construct admissible solutions, i.e. solutions which satisfy the energy inequality.
  Moreover using the convex integration method developed in this paper, we show that the local maximal dissipation criterion fails in the following sense: There exist wild solutions which beat the self-similar solution of the one-dimensional Riemann problem extended to two dimensions. Hence the local maximal dissipation criterion rules out the self-similar solution.
  The convex integration machinery itself is carried out in a very general way. Hence this paper provides a universal framework for convex integration which not even specifies the form of the partial differential equations under consideration. Therefore this general framework is applicable in many different situations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the mean curvature of a smooth surface in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$, arises as the limit of a sequence of functions that are intrinsically related to the difference between an $n$- and $1$-dimensional fractional Laplacian of a phase transition. Depending on the order of the fractional Laplace operator, we recover the fractional mean curvature or the classical mean curvature of the surface. Moreover, we show that this is an essential ingredient for deriving the evolution of fronts in fractional reaction-diffusion equations such as those for atomic dislocations in crystals.</description>

      <title>Prescribing almost constant curvatures on manifolds with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a boundary case of the classical prescribed curvature problem. We focus on prescribing the scalar curvature function K and the boundary mean curvature H on the standard ball. Our analysis extendes previous studies by considering the scenario where the curvatures K and H are close to constants. Using a perturbative approach and leveraging the ansatz introduced by Han and Li, we establish new existence results for the conformal metric when the prescribed curvatures are near constants</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence rate to the nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar variational model for Neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the nonrelativistic limit of Chandrasekhar variational model for neutron stars. We show that the minimizer $\rho_{c}$ of Chandrasekhar energy $E_c(N)$ converges strongly to the minimizer $\rho_{\infty}$ of limit energy $E_{\infty}(N)$ in $L^1\cap L^{\frac{5}{3}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ as the speed of light $c\rightarrow\infty$, this is a limit between two free boundary problems. Moreover, we develop a novel approach to obtain the convergence rates, we show that the above nonrelativistic limit has the optimal convergence rate $\frac{1}{c^2}$. For the radius $R_c$ of the compact support of $\rho_c(x)$ and the radius $R_\infty$ of the compact support of $\rho_\infty(x)$, we also get the optimal convergence rate $\frac{1}{c^2}$, this means that $R_\infty-R_c=O(\frac{1}{c^2})$ as $c\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we also obtain the optimal uniform bounds of $R_c$ and $L^\infty$-norm of $\rho_c$ with respect to $N$ as $c\rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Qualitative properties of the spreading speed of a population structured in space and in phenotype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal Fisher-KPP equation that models a population structured in space and in phenotype. The population lives in a heterogeneous periodic environment: the diffusion coefficient, the mutation coefficient and the fitness of an individual may depend on its spatial position and on its phenotype.
  We first prove a Freidlin-G\"artner formula for the spreading speed of the population. We then study the behaviour of the spreading speed in different scaling limits (small and large period, small and large mutation coefficient). Finally, we exhibit new phenomena arising thanks to the phenotypic dimension. Our results are also valid when the phenotype is seen as another spatial variable along which the population does not spread.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of second-order differential operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: {Let $N, k$ be positive integers with $k\geq 2$, and $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ be a domain.} By the well-known properties of the Laplacian and the gradient, we have \[ \Delta(f\cdot g)(x)=g(x) \Delta f(x)+f(x) \Delta g(x)+2\langle \nabla f(x), \nabla g(x)\rangle \] for all $f, g\in \mathscr{C}^{k}(\Omega, \mathbb{R})$. {Due to the results of H.~K\"{o}nig and V.~Milman, Operator relations characterizing derivatives. Birkh\"{a}user / Springer, Cham, 2018.,} the converse is also true, i.e. this operator equation characterizes the Laplacian and the gradient under some assumptions. Thus the main aim of this paper is to provide an extension of this result and to study the corresponding equation \[
  T(f\cdot g)= fT(g)+T(f)g+2B(A(f), A(g))
  \qquad
  \left(f, g\in P\right), \] where $Q$ and $R$ are commutative rings, $P$ is a subring of $Q$ and $T\colon P\to Q$ and $A\colon P\to R$ are additive, while $B\colon R\times R\to Q$ is a symmetric and bi-additive. Related identities with one function will also be considered.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for systems of nonlocal balance laws modeling dense multilane vehicular traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of coupled system of nonlocal nonlinear balance laws modeling multilane traffic, with the nonlocality present in both convective and source terms. The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution is proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, as opposed to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., drad101, 2024]. The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is also indicated. Numerical simulations illustrating the theory and the behavior of the entropy solution as the support of the kernel goes to zero (nonlocal to local limit), are shown.</description>
