      <title>Enzymatic Mpemba Effect: Slowing of biochemical reactions by increasing enzyme concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the enzyme concentration generally speeds up enzymatic reactions. However, in this Letter, we show that increasing the enzyme concentration can also slow down the enzymatic reaction. We consider a simple allosteric protein with multiple modification sites, catalyzed by two enzymes with the same catalytic activity, but slightly different affinities. We show that increasing the concentration of one enzyme can slow the relaxation to the equilibrium state. The mechanism for this slowing is similar the Markovian Mpemba effect, and we name this phenomenon as the Enzymatic Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>h-CMD: An efficient hybrid fast centroid and quasi-centroid molecular dynamics method for the simulation of vibrational spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing efficient path integral (PI) methods for atomistic simulations of vibrational spectra in heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces has long been a challenging task. Here, we present the h-CMD method, short for hybrid centroid molecular dynamics, that combines the recently introduced fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) method with fast CMD (f-CMD). In this scheme, molecules that are believed to suffer more seriously from the curvature problem of CMD, e.g., water, are treated with f-QCMD, while the rest, e.g., solid surfaces, are treated with f-CMD. To test the accuracy of the newly introduced scheme, the infrared spectra of the interfacial D2O confined in the archetypal ZIF-90 framework are simulated using h-CMD compared to a variety of other PI methods, including thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (T-RPMD) and partially adiabatic CMD as well as f-CMD and experiment as reference. Comparisons are also made to classical MD, where nuclear quantum effects are neglected entirely. Our detailed comparisons at different temperatures of 250-600 K show that h-CMD produces O-D stretches that are in close agreement with the experiment, correcting the known curvature problem and red-shifting of the stretch peaks of CMD. h-CMD also corrects the known issues associated with too artificially dampened and broadened spectra of T-RPMD, which leads to missing the characteristic doublet feature of the interfacial confined water, rendering it unsuitable for these systems. The new h-CMD method broadens the applicability of f-QCMD to heterogeneous condensed phases and interfaces, where defining curvilinear coordinates for the entire system is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Determining minimum energy conical intersections by enveloping the seam: exploring ground and excited state intersections in coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08207v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum energy conical intersections can be used to rationalize photochemical processes. In this Letter, we examine an algorithm to locate these structures that does not require the evaluation of nonadiabatic coupling vectors, showing that it minimizes the energy on hypersurfaces that envelop the intersection seam. By constraining the states to be separated by a small non-zero energy difference, the algorithm ensures that numerical artifacts and convergence problems of coupled cluster theory at conical intersections are not encountered during the optimization. In this way, we demonstrate for various systems that minimum energy conical intersections with the ground state are well described by the coupled cluster singles and doubles model, suggesting that coupled cluster theory may in some cases provide a good description of relaxation to the ground state in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Understanding failures in electronic structure methods arising from the geometric phase effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08209v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that intermediate normalization of the electronic wave function, where a constant component is enforced, will lead to an asymptotic discontinuity at one point along any path that encloses a ground state conical intersection. For some electronic structure methods, this gives rise to severe global artifacts in the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces. We investigate how this affects two electronic structure methods: coupled cluster theory and M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory. The analysis suggests that intermediate normalization is problematic not only in near-degenerate regions, such as in the vicinity of conical intersections. In particular, since problems will occur for any path that encloses a ground state intersection, the affected methods can unexpectedly break down in regions of internal coordinate space that are normally considered within their range of validity.</description>

      <title>Quantum electrodynamic corrections for molecules: Vacuum polarisation and electron self energy in a two-component relativistic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum polarisation (VP) and electron self energy (SE) are implemented and evaluated as quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections in a (quasi-relativistic) two-component zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA) framework. For VP, the Uehling potential is considered, and for SE, the effective potentials proposed by Flambaum and Ginges as well as the one proposed by Pyykk\"o and Zhao. QED contributions to ionisation energies of various atoms and group 2 monofluorides, group 1 and 11 valence orbital energies, $^2\mathrm{P}_{1/2} \leftarrow {}^{2}\mathrm{S}_{1/2}$ and $^{2}\mathrm{P}_{3/2} \leftarrow {}^{2}\mathrm{S}_{1/2}$ transition energies of Li-, Na-, and Cu-like ions of nuclear charge $Z$ = 10, 20, ..., 90 as well as $\Pi_{1/2}\leftarrow \Sigma_{1/2}$ and $\Pi_{3/2}\leftarrow\Sigma_{1/2}$ transition energies of BaF and RaF are presented. Furthermore, perturbative and self-consistent treatments of QED corrections are compared for Kohn--Sham orbital energies of gold. It is demonstrated, that QED corrections can be obtained in a two-component ZORA framework efficiently and in excellent agreement with corresponding four-component results.</description>

      <title>Cholesky Decomposition and the Second-Derivative Two-Electron Integrals Required for the Computation of Magnetizabilities using Gauge-Including Atomic Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of magnetizability tensors using gauge-including atomic orbitals is discussed in the context of Cholesky decomposition for the two-electron repulsion integrals with a focus on the involved doubly differentiated integrals. Three schemes for their handling are suggested: the first exploits the DF aspect of Cholesky decomposition, the second uses expressions obtained by differentiating the CD expression for the unperturbed two electron integrals, while the third addresses the issue that the first two schemes are not able to represent the doubly differentiated integrals with arbitrary accuracy. This scheme uses a separate Cholesky decomposition for the cross terms in the doubly differentiated two-electron integrals. Test calculations reveal that all three schemes are able to represent the integrals with similar accuracy and yield indistinguishable results for the values of the computed magnetizability tensor elements. Thus, we recommend our first scheme which has the lowest computational cost for routine computations. The applicability of our CD schemes is further shown in large-scale Hartree-Fock calculations of the magnetizability tensor of coronene (C24H12) with a doubly polarized triple-zeta basis consisting of 684 basis functions.</description>

      <title>Space-local memory in generalized master equations: Reaching the thermodynamic limit for the cost of a small lattice simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact quantum dynamics of lattice models can be computationally intensive, especially when aiming for large system sizes and extended simulation times necessary to converge transport coefficients. By leveraging finite memory times to access long-time dynamics using only short-time data, generalized master equations (GMEs) can offer a route to simulating the dynamics of lattice problems efficiently. However, such simulations are limited to small lattices whose dynamics exhibit finite-size artifacts that contaminate transport coefficient predictions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel approach that exploits finite memory in time \textit{and} space to efficiently predict the many-body dynamics of dissipative lattice problems involving short-range interactions. This advance enables one to leverage the short-time dynamics of small lattices to simulate arbitrarily large systems over long times. We demonstrate the strengths of this method by focusing on nonequilibrium polaron relaxation and transport in the dispersive Holstein model, successfully simulating lattice dynamics in one and two dimensions free from finite-size effects, reducing the computational expense of such simulations by multiple orders of magnitude. Our method is broadly applicable and provides an accurate and efficient means to investigate nonequilibrium relaxation with microscopic resolution over mesoscopic length and time scales that are relevant to experiment.</description>

      <title>Generalized coupled cluster theory for ground and excited state intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08751v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory in the standard formulation is unable to correctly describe conical intersections among states of the same symmetry. This limitation has restricted the practical application of an otherwise highly accurate electronic structure model, particularly in nonadiabatic dynamics. Recently, the intersection problem among the excited states was fully characterized and resolved. However, intersections with the ground state remain an open challenge, and addressing this problem is our objective here. We present a generalized coupled cluster framework that correctly accounts for the geometric phase effect and avoids bifurcations of the solutions to the ground state equations. Several applications are presented that demonstrate the correct description of ground state conical intersections. We also propose how the framework can be used for other electronic-structure methods.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Enhancements of Empirical Energy Functions: Structure, Dynamics and Spectroscopy of Modified Benzenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of replacing individual contributions to an empirical energy function are assessed for halogenated benzenes (X-Bz, X = H, F, Cl, Br) and chlorinated phenols (Cl-PhOH). Introducing electrostatic models based on distributed charges (MDCM) instead of usual atom-centered point charges yields overestimated hydration free energies unless the van der Waals parameters are reparametrized. Scaling van der Waals ranges by 10 \% to 20 \% for three Cl-PhOH and most X-Bz yield results within experimental error bars, which is encouraging, whereas for benzene (H-Bz) point charge-based models are sufficient. Replacing the bonded terms by a neural network-trained energy function with either fluctuating charges or MDCM electrostatics also yields qualitatively correct hydration free energies which still require adaptation of the van der Waals parameters. The infrared spectroscopy of Cl-PhOH is rather well predicted by all models although the ML-based energy function performs somewhat better in the region of the framework modes. It is concluded that refinements of empirical energy functions for targeted applications is a meaningful way towards more quantitative simulations.</description>

      <title>Leidenfrost drop dynamics: An approach to follow the complete evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new model to follow the complete evolution of a drop in Leidenfrost state is presented in this work. The main ingredients of the phenomenon were considered, including: 1) the shape and weight of a sessile drop, according to its size, compared to the capillary length, using the Young-Laplace equation; 2) the evaporation at the entire surface of the drop, due to the heat transfer across the vapor film, to the proximitiy of a hot plate and to the diffusion in air; 3) the velocity, pressure and temperature fields at the vapor film, between the drop and the hot plate, which are recovered by means of a Hankel transform method, being valid for any size of drops and any thickness of vapor films (below the vapor film stability threshold); 4) an estimation of the thermo-capillary Marangoni convection flow, without simulating numerically the flow within the drop. The aforementioned features were addressed and calculated, in order to include their effect within a single non-linear ODE, describing the temporal evolution of the size of the drop, through the Bond number. Three dimensionless parameters, relating the thermophysical properties of the drop fluid and the surrounding air, control the development of the phenomenon. All those properties were calculated according to the ideal gas approximation and to widely used empirical correlations, without any fitting parameter. The model predictions were compared against experimental results, using different organic and inorganic compounds, for which a good agreement has been found, when no bounce or rotation of the drop spontaneously occurs.</description>

      <title>Assessing many-body methods on the potential energy surface of the (H$_2$)$_2$ hydrogen dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anisotropic potential energy surface of the (H$_2$)$_2$ dimer represents a challenging problem for many-body methods. Here, we determine the potential energy curves of five different dimer configurations (T, Z, X, H, L) using the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method and a number of approximate functionals within density functional theory (DFT), including advanced orbital-dependent functionals based on the random phase approximation (RPA). We assess their performance in describing the potential wells, bond distances and relative energies. The repulsive potential wall is studied by looking at the relative stability of the different dimer configurations as a function of an applied force acting along the intermolecular axis. It is shown that most functionals within DFT break down at finite compression, even those that give an accurate description around the potential well minima. Only by including exchange within RPA a qualitatively correct description along the entire potential energy curve is obtained. Finally, we discuss these results in the context of solid molecular hydrogen at finite pressures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for simulating the open dynamics of spin-boson systems by combining variational non-Gaussian states with a quantum trajectories approach. We apply this method to a generic spin-boson Hamiltonian that has both Tavis-Cummings and Holstein type couplings, and which has broad applications to a variety of quantum simulation platforms, polaritonic physics, and quantum chemistry. Additionally, we discuss how the recently developed truncated Wigner approximation for open quantum systems can be applied to the same Hamiltonian. We benchmark the performance of both methods and identify the regimes where each method is best suited to. Finally we discuss strategies to improve each technique.</description>

      <title>Flat-plane based double-counting free and parameter free many-body DFT+U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Burgess et al. have recently introduced the BLOR corrective exchange-correlation functional that is, by construction, the unique simplified rotationally-invariant DFT+U functional that enforces the flat-plane condition separately on each effective orbital of a localized subspace. Detached from the Hubbard model, functionals of this type are both double-counting correction free and, when optimized in situ using appropriate error quantifiers, effectively parameter free. In this work, the extension of the BLOR functional to address many-body errors (mBLOR) is derived. The mBLOR functional is built to enforce the flat-plane condition on the entire subspace, rather than on each orbital individually. In this way inter-orbital errors are corrected on the same footing as the single-particle ones. Focusing on exact test cases with strong inter-orbital interactions, the BLOR and mBLOR functionals were benchmarked against contemporary DFT+U functionals using the total energy extensivity condition on stretched homo-nuclear p-block dimers that represent various self-interaction and static-correlation error regimes. The BLOR functional outperformed all other DFT+$U$ functionals tested, which often act to increase total-energy errors, yet it still yielded large errors in some systems. mBLOR instead yielded low energy errors across all four strongly-correlated dimers, while being constructed using only semi-local approximation ingredients. As mBLOR would not otherwise introduce a band-gap correction in the manner that is a desirable feature of DFT+U, we developed a cost-free technique to reintroduce it automatically by moving the functional's unusual explicit derivative discontinuity into the potential. With this in place, mBLOR is the only known DFT$+U$ functional that opens the bandgap of stretched neutral homo-nuclear dimers without the aid of unphysical spin-symmetry breaking.</description>
