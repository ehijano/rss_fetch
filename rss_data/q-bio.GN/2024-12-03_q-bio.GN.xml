      <title>LLaMA-Gene: A General-purpose Gene Task Large Language Model Based on Instruction Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building a general-purpose task model similar to ChatGPT has been an important research direction for gene large language models. Instruction fine-tuning is a key component in building ChatGPT, but existing instructions are primarily based on natural language. Natural language and gene sequences have significant differences in tokenization and encoding. Therefore, constructing a multilingual model that can handle both natural language and gene sequences is crucial for solving this problem.In this paper, we expand the capabilities of the LLaMA large language model to include gene language. This involves expanding the vocabulary using the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) method, specifically tailored for DNA and protein sequences, and conducting further pre-training on these sequences. We then convert various downstream gene task data into a unified format for instruction fine-tuning and further fine-tune the model on this data.Our study demonstrates that a mixed model of gene and natural language, fine-tuned with instructions, achieves results comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in tasks such as gene classification and gene sequence interaction. This provides a promising direction for building a unified large language model for gene tasks.</description>

      <title>Microbial Mat Metagenomes from Waikite Valley, Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of complex multicellular ecosystems Neoproterozoic time was preceded by a microbial Proterozoic biosphere, where productivity may have been largely restricted to microbial mats made up of bacteria including oxygenic photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, anoxygenic phototrophs, and heterotrophs. In modern environments, analogous microbial mats can be found in restricted environments such as carbonate tidal flats and terrestrial hot springs. Here, we report metagenomic sequence data from an analog in the hot springs of Waikite Valley, Aotearoa New Zealand, where carbon-rich, slightly-alkaline geothermal waters support diverse phototrophic microbial mats.
  The Waikite Valley hot spring in the Taupo Volcanic Zone of Aotearoa New Zealand was sampled in duplicate at 8 points along a temperature gradient transect of the outflow, from ~62 C (near the source) to ~37 C (~100 meters downstream). ~686 Gb of shotgun metagenomic sequence data was generated by Illumina Novaseq. Each sample was assembled using SPAdes, followed by binning of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) by MetaBAT. These data are useful for the genomic analysis of novel phototrophic bacteria, as well as for ecological comparisons between thermophilic communities with varying temperatures but otherwise similar conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Molecule-Enhanced Pathology Image Representation Learning via Integrating Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal pre-training models have significantly advanced computational pathology. However, current approaches predominantly rely on visual-language models, which may impose limitations from a molecular perspective and lead to performance bottlenecks. Here, we introduce a Unified Molecule-enhanced Pathology Image REpresentationn Learning framework (UMPIRE). UMPIRE aims to leverage complementary information from gene expression profiles to guide the multimodal pre-training, enhancing the molecular awareness of pathology image representation learning. We demonstrate that this molecular perspective provides a robust, task-agnostic training signal for learning pathology image embeddings. Due to the scarcity of paired data, approximately 4 million entries of spatial transcriptomics gene expression were collected to train the gene encoder. By leveraging powerful pre-trained encoders, UMPIRE aligns the encoders across over 697K pathology image-gene expression pairs. The performance of UMPIRE is demonstrated across various molecular-related downstream tasks, including gene expression prediction, spot classification, and mutation state prediction in whole slide images. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and open new avenues for exploring computational pathology enhanced by molecular perspectives. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/Hanminghao/UMPIRE.</description>

      <title>SUICA: Learning Super-high Dimensional Sparse Implicit Neural Representations for Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a method that captures spatial gene expression profiles within histological sections. The discrete spatial distribution and the super-high dimensional sequencing results make ST data challenging to be modeled effectively. In this paper, we manage to model ST in a continuous and compact manner by the proposed tool, SUICA, empowered by the great approximation capability of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) that can improve both the spatial resolution and the gene expression. Concretely within the proposed SUICA, we incorporate a graph-augmented Autoencoder to effectively model the context information of the unstructured spots and provide informative embeddings that are structure-aware for spatial mapping. We also tackle the extremely skewed distribution in a regression-by-classification fashion and enforce classification-based loss functions for the optimization of SUICA. By extensive experiments of a wide range of common ST platforms, SUICA outperforms both conventional INR variants and SOTA methods for ST super-resolution regarding numerical fidelity, statistical correlation, and bio-conservation. The prediction by SUICA also showcases amplified gene signatures that enriches the bio-conservation of the raw data and benefits subsequent analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/Szym29/SUICA.</description>

      <title>The influence of chromosomal inversions on genetic variation and clinal patterns in genomic data of Drosophila melanogaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromosomal inversions are structural mutations resulting in the reversal of the gene order along the corresponding genomic region. Due to their influence on recombination patterns, they can have a major influence on genetic variation and the evolutionary process. Accordingly, inversions can act as supergenes that keep together co-adapted gene complexes that form the genetic basis of many complex phenotypes in diverse organisms. In this book chapter, I will present an analysis pipeline to investigate the influence of two common cosmopolitan inversion, In(2L)t and In(3R)Payne, on genome-wide genetic variation and differentiation in world-wide populations of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. We will use single-individual and pooled resequencing data in combination with population genomics analysis tools to explore the impact of these two inversions on genetic variation, population structure, and clinal variation in natural populations.</description>

      <title>pasta: Pattern Analysis for Spatial Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial omics assays allow for the molecular characterisation of cells in their spatial context. Notably, the two main technological streams, imaging-based and high-throughput sequencing-based, can give rise to very different data modalities. The characteristics of the two data types are well known in adjacent fields such as spatial statistics as point patterns and lattice data, and there is a wide range of tools available. This paper discusses the application of spatial statistics to spatially-resolved omics data and in particular, discusses various advantages, challenges, and nuances. This work is accompanied by a vignette, pasta, that showcases the usefulness of spatial statistics in biology using several R packages.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Classification for Predicting Metastasis Using Elastic-Net Regularization on Gene Expression Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastasis is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and remains challenging to detect during early stages. Accurate identification of cancers likely to metastasize can improve treatment strategies and patient outcomes. This study leverages publicly available gene expression profiles from primary cancers, with and without distal metastasis, to build predictive models. We utilize elastic net regularization within a hierarchical classification framework to predict both the tissue of origin and the metastasis status of primary tumors. Our elastic net-based hierarchical classification achieved a tissue-of-origin prediction accuracy of 97%, and a metastasis prediction accuracy of 90%. Notably, mitochondrial gene expression exhibited significant negative correlations with metastasis, providing potential biological insights into the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression.</description>
