      <title>A Panchromatic Characterization of the Evening and Morning Atmosphere of WASP-107 b: Composition and Cloud Variations, and Insight into the Effect of Stellar Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limb-resolved transmission spectroscopy has the potential to transform our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres. By separately measuring the transmission spectra of the evening and morning limbs, these atmospheric regions can be individually characterized, shedding light into the global distribution and transport of key atmospheric properties from transit observations alone. In this work, we follow up the recent detection of limb asymmetry on the exoplanet WASP-107 b (Murphy et al. 2024) by reanalyzing literature observations of WASP-107 b using all of JWST's science intruments (NIRISS, NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI) to measure its limb transmission spectra from $\sim$1-12 $\mu$m. We confirm the evening--morning temperature difference inferred previously and find that it is qualitatively consistent with predictions from global circulation models. We find evidence for evening--morning variation in SO$_2$ and CO$_2$ abundance, and significant cloud coverage only on WASP-107 b's morning limb. We find that the NIRISS and NIRSpec observations are potentially contaminated by occulted starspots, which we leverage to investigate stellar contamination's impact on limb asymmetry measurements. We find that starspot crossings can significantly bias the inferred evening and morning transmission spectra depending on when they occur during the transit, and develop a simple correction model which successfully brings these instruments' spectra into agreement with the uncontaminated observations.</description>

      <title>Oort Cloud Ecology. III. The Sun left the parent star cluster shortly after the giant planets formed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun was born in a clustered environment with 10,000 other stars. Being an isolated star today, the Sun must have left the nest. We do not directly know when that happened, how violent the ejection was, or how far the Solar siblings have drifted apart. The mass of the fragile outer Opic-Oort cloud, (between $r_{\rm inner} \sim 30,000$\,au and $200\,000$au from the Sun) and the orbital distribution of planetesimals in the inner Hills-Oort cloud (between $\sim 1000$\,au and $\sim 30\,000$ au) are sensitive to the dynamical processes involving the Sun in the parent cluster. We aim at understanding the extend to which observing the Oort cloud constrains the Sun's birth environment. This is achieved by a combination of theoretical arguments and N-body simulations. We show that the current mass of the Opic-Oort cloud (between 0.2 and $2.0$ Earth masses) is best explained if the Sun left the nest within $\sim 20$\,Myr after the giant planets formed and migrated. As a consequence, the possible dynamical encounter with another star carving the Kuiper belt, the Sun's abduction of Sedna, and other perturbations induced by nearby stars then must have happened shortly after the giant planets in the Solar system formed, but before the Sun left the parent cluster. Signatures of the time spend in the parent cluster must still be visible in the outer parts of the Solar system today. The strongest constraints will be the discovery of a population of relatively low-eccentricity ($e &lt; 0.9$) inner Oort-cloud (but $500 &lt; a &lt; 10^4$\,au) objects.</description>

      <title>Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation on Sub-Neptune Exoplanet Hazes Through Laboratory Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperate sub-Neptune exoplanets could contain large inventories of water in various phases, such as water-worlds with water-rich atmospheres or even oceans. Both space-based and ground-based observations have shown that many exoplanets likely also contain photochemically-generated hazes. Haze particles are a key source of organic matter and may impact the evolution or origin of life. In addition, haze layers could provide a mechanism for lower-atmospheric shielding and ultimately atmospheric retention. Often orbiting close to M-dwarf stars, these planets receive large amounts of radiation, especially during flaring events, which may strip away their atmospheres. M-dwarf stars are known to have higher stellar activity than other types of stars, and stellar flares have the potential to accelerate atmospheric escape. In this work, we present results on laboratory investigations of UV radiation effects simulating two different stellar flare energies on laboratory-produced exoplanet hazes made under conditions analogous to water-world atmospheres. We find that both simulated flares altered the overall transmittance and reflectance of the hazes, and higher energy "flares" make those alterations more pronounced. On a larger scale, these laboratory-made hazes show potential signs of degradation over the simulated flaring period. Our results provide insight into the effects that stellar flaring events have on potential exoplanet haze composition and the ability for water-world-like exoplanets to retain their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Can thermodynamic equilibrium be established in planet-forming disks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner regions of planet-forming disks are warm and dense. The chemical networks used for disk modelling so far were developed for a cold and dilute medium and do not include a complete set of pressure-dependent reactions. The chemical networks developed for planetary atmospheres include such reactions along with the inverse reactions related to the Gibb's free energies of the molecules. The chemical networks used for disk modelling are thus incomplete in this respect. We want to study whether thermodynamic equilibrium can be established in a planet-forming disk. We identify the regions in the disk most likely to reach thermodynamic equilibrium and determine the timescale over which this occurs. We employ the theoretical concepts used in exoplanet atmosphere chemistry for the disk modelling with PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel ({\sc ProDiMo}). We develop a chemical network called CHemistry Assembled from exoplanets and dIsks for Thermodynamic EquilibriA ({\sc ChaiTea}) that is based on the UMIST 2022, STAND, and large DIscANAlysis (DIANA) chemical networks. It consists of 239 species. From the STAND network, we adopt the concept of reversing all gas-phase reactions based on thermodynamic data. We use single-point models for a range of gas densities and gas temperatures to verify that the implemented concepts work and thermodynamic equilibrium is achieved in the absence of cosmic rays and photoreactions including radiative associations and direct recombinations. We then study the impact of photoreactions and cosmic rays that lead to deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium. We explore the chemical relaxation timescales towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Lastly, we study the predicted 2D chemical structure of a typical T\,Tauri disk when using the new {\sc ChaiTea} network instead of the large DIANA standard network, including photorates, cosmic rays, X-rays, and ice....</description>

      <title>Detection of Hydrocarbons in the Disk around an Actively-Accreting Planetary-Mass Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the 0.6--12-micron spectrum of Cha\,1107-7626, a 6-10 Jupiter-mass free-floating object in the $\sim$2\,Myr-old Chamaeleon-I star-forming region, from observations with the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We confirm that Cha\,1107-7626 is one of the lowest-mass objects known to harbor a dusty disk with infrared excess emission at wavelengths beyond 4 microns. Our NIRSpec data, and prior ground-based observations, provide strong evidence for ongoing accretion through Hydrogen recombination lines. In the mid-infrared spectrum, we detect unambiguously emission lines caused by methane (CH$_\mathrm{4}$) and ethylene (C$_\mathrm{2}$H$_\mathrm{4}$) in its circum-substellar disk. Our findings mean that Cha 1107-7626 is by far the lowest-mass object with hydrocarbons observed in its disk. The spectrum of the disk looks remarkably similar to that of ISO-ChaI 147, a very low mass star with a carbon-rich disk that is 10 to 20 times more massive than Cha\,1107-7626. The hydrocarbon lines can be accounted for with a model assuming gas temperatures of a few hundred Kelvin in the inner disk. The obvious similarities between the spectra of a low-mass star and a planetary-mass object indicate that the conditions in the inner disks can be similar across a wide range of central object masses.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Brown Hamiltonian-I. A high-accuracy model for von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple systems with low hierarchical structure are common throughout the Universe, including examples such as high-altitude lunar satellites influenced by the Earth, planetary satellites perturbed by the Sun, and stellar binaries affected by a supermassive black hole. In these systems, nonlinear perturbations are significant, making classical double-averaged models (even those incorporating the Brown Hamiltonian correction) insufficient for accurately capturing long-term dynamics. To overcome this limitation, the current study develops a high-precision dynamical model that incorporates the nonlinear effects of the quadrupole-order potential arising from both the inner and outer bodies, referred to as the extended Brown Hamiltonian model. This framework specifically expresses the Hamiltonian function and the transformation between mean and osculating orbital elements in elegant, closed forms with respect to the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits. Practical applications to Jupiter's irregular satellites show that the long-term evolutions predicted by the extended Brown Hamiltonian model align well with the results of direct N-body simulations. The developed Hamiltonian offers a fundamental dynamical model, which is particularly well suited for describing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations in low-hierarchy three-body systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Predicted Blended Eclipsing Binary False Positives in PLATO LOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the planned launch of the PLAnetary Transit and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) satellite mission in 2026, an understanding of the stellar properties and spatial distribution of astrophysical false positives (FPs) is essential to ensure the limited ground-based spectroscopy resources are used efficiently to target the most likely genuine planetary transit (PT) candidates. In our previous paper, Bray et al. (2023), we presented the expected blended eclipsing binary false positive (BEB) percentage in the proposed Southern PLATO field, which we referred to as SPF0. This was obtained from a detailed statistical analysis of a complete synthetic rendering of SPF0. In this follow-up paper, we present a more detailed analysis of the synthetic binary population creating these BEBs including the apparent radii of the planets mimicked, distances from Earth, orbital periods and binary component masses and evolutionary state.We examine the properties of the BEBs from 400 new independent simulations where random orbital inclinations were assigned to all synthetic binaries in the entire SPF0 region. We consider BEBs created by all eclipses of non-compact remnant binaries. Finally we examine the BEBs most likely to be mistaken for planets in the habitable zone which we define as fully or partially eclipsing binaries with periods between 180 and 1,000 days satisfying our critical inclination angle check.</description>

      <title>Capture and Escape of Planetary Mean-motion Resonances in Turbulent Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-motion resonances (MMRs) form through convergent disc migration of planet pairs, which may be disrupted by dynamical instabilities after protoplanetary disc (PPD) dispersal. This scenario is supported by recent analysis of TESS data showing that neighboring planet pairs in younger planetary systems are closer to resonance. To study stability of MMRs during migration, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of migrating planet pairs in PPDs, comparing the effect of laminar viscosity and realistic turbulence. We find stable 3:2 resonance capture for terrestrial planet pairs migrating in a moderately massive PPD, insensitive to a range of laminar viscosity (alpha = 0.001 to 0.1). However, realistic turbulence enhances overstability by sustaining higher equilibrium eccentricities and a positive growth rate in libration amplitude, ultimately leading to resonance escape. The equilibrium eccentricity growth rates decrease as planets migrate into tighter and more stable 4:3 and 5:4 MMRs. Our results suggest that active disc turbulence broadens the parameter space for overstability, causing planet pairs to end up in closer-in orbital separations. Libration within MMR typically lead to deviation from exact period ratio |Delta| \sim 0.5%, which alone is insufficient to produce the typical dispersion of |Delta| \sim 1 to 3% in TESS data, suggesting that post migration dynamical processes are needed to further amplify the offset.</description>

      <title>ThermoONet -- a deep learning-based small body thermophysical network: applications to modelling water activity of comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope, respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, when combined with a global optimization algorithm, ThermoONet proves capable of retrieving the physical properties of target bodies.</description>

      <title>CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) IV: New planetary systems around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 and an update on HD 121056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With around 200 detections of exoplanets around giant stars to date, our knowledge of the population of exoplanets orbiting evolved hosts more massive than the Sun remains limited. The CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) was launched in 2006 with the aim of improving our understanding of the demographics of exoplanets around intermediate-mass stars, by studying them once they have evolved off the main sequence. We intend to refine the current sample of known exoplanets orbiting intermediate-mass (1.5 - 5 M$_\odot$) giant stars of spectral types G and early K. We searched for exoplanets orbiting the four stars HD 87816, HD 94890, HD 102888, and HD 121056. We used data obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph, mounted on the Leonhard Euler Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory in Chile. We gathered high-precision radial-velocity measurements over more than ten years for each of the aforementioned targets. We started by performing a search for periodic signals in the radial-velocity time series of the four targets by using periodograms. Following this, we fit for a Keplerian model using the significant peak with the highest power of the periodogram as the starting guess for the period. We then subtracted this model and repeated the procedure iteratively on the residuals until no significant peaks were found. Finally, to explore the posterior distribution of our models, the final solution was determined using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We report the discovery of five new massive planets around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 as well as the presence of a distant, potentially substellar, companion around HD 102888. We confirm the presence of a previously announced exoplanet orbiting the HD 121056 multi-object system with a period of 89 days and propose an update to the period of the outer companion.</description>

      <title>Non-ideal MHD simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Hot Jupiters (HJs), atmospherically induced magnetic fields are expected to play an important role in controlling the wind circulation and in determining their inflated radii. Here we perform 1D plane-parallel magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of HJ atmospheric columns, using the wind and thermodynamic profiles generated by global circulation models of different exo-planets. We quantitatively investigate the effects of magnetic field winding and Ohmic dissipation (previously considered in several works), with the addition of Hall drift and ambipolar diffusion. The main effect is the magnetic field winding in the full non-linear regime, with local azimuthal fields reaching maximum values up to ${\cal O}(10^2)$ G at the shear layer (typical pressure $\sim 1$ bar), much stronger than the assumed background field generated in the planetary interior. The associated meridional currents undergo Ohmic dissipation, with local heating efficiencies of at least $\sim$ ${10^{-6}}-10^{-3}$ (considering only these shallow layers). In addition to the dominant winding vs. Ohmic balance, the presence of the Hall and ambipolar terms have a non-negligible contribution in shaping and twisting the induced magnetic field at $p\lesssim 1$ bar; however this effect is only apparent for the hottest planets. Our results, though limited by construction to a plane-parallel approximation of the sub-stellar columns and with a simplified setup that cannot consistently include the magnetic drag on the wind, assess the non-linearity and complexity of the magnetic induction in HJs atmospheres, and call for a self-consistent inclusion of MHD effects in Ohmic dissipation studies and circulation models, beyond the often-assumed perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>OSIRIS-REx Operational Key Decision Points: A Retrospective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OSIRIS-REx, NASA's first asteroid sample return mission, rendezvoused with the near-Earth asteroid Bennu in 2018 and delivered a 121.6-gram sample to Earth in 2023, the largest amount of material ever recovered from a planetary body beyond the Moon. The operations phase of OSIRIS-REx was considered the most challenging robotic mission that NASA had undertaken, owing to the tight constraints on spacecraft performance and the microgravity environment. In preparation for the sample collection and return campaign, the mission leadership defined four operational key decision points (OKDPs) at critical junctures: sample site selection, rehearsal and execution of the sample collection maneuver, sample stow, and Earth return. This publication examines these OKDPs in depth, inclusive of rationale, implementation, decision processes, and efficacy. We also review other decisions that enabled mission success despite the unexpectedly rugged nature of Bennu's surface. This information should be beneficial for future challenging operational concepts where science-in-the-loop, time-critical decision making is integral to success.</description>

      <title>The Great Comets of 1843 and 1882 at Their Previous Return to Perihelion in the Twelfth Century: One Spectacular, the Other Dull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New insights into the history of C/1843 D1 and C/1882 R1, the two celebrated Kreutz sungrazers, are provided by assessing evidence on their appearance at the previous perihelion return, known as X/1106 C1 and the Chinese comet of 1138 (Ho's No. 403), respectively. The conditions differed vastly because of disparities in geocentric distance, solar elongation, and phase correction (forward scattering), all linked to the arrival times (early February vs early August). The conclusions include: the daytime sighting of the 1106 comet by Sigebert de Gembloux is consistent with expectation and so are the accounts of an exceptionally long tail observed later in twilight; the comet reached perihelion only hours before its daytime detection; the 1138 comet could have never been sighted in daylight or discovered much earlier than it actually was, in early September, one month after perihelion; at discovery, the tail is predicted to have reached elevations of 15-30 deg, while the head was merely 10 deg above horizon, when observed from moderate northern latitudes; notion that Kreutz sungrazers at perihelion between mid-May and mid-August could not be seen from the ground except possibly in daylight is misleading; the appearance of the 1138 comet's nucleus after its tidal fragmentation at perihelion is modeled on the assumption that it consisted of five major fragments (including C/1882 R1 and C/1965 S1); and unpredictable morphological changes with time in the 1882 sungrazer's split nucleus are discussed.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical investigation on N2 pressure-induced coefficients of the lowest rotational transitions of HCN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first experimental determination of room-temperature N2 pressure broadening, speed dependent broadening, and pressure shift coefficients of the three lowest rotational lines of HCN. The experimental results served to assess the accuracy of a low-cost yet accurate computational strategy, which relies on a simplified characterization of the HCN-N2 interaction potential, and employs a novel approximate method of solving the quantum scattering problem. Building on the validation of this computational approach, the dataset was extended to higher rotational transitions, up to J(HCN)=5-4. For these transitions, we provide the temperature dependence of the pressure broadening coefficient, its speed dependence parameter, and the Dicke narrowing parameter. This new dataset will be incorporated into the HITRAN database to support and refine the modeling of HCN in both the terrestrial and Titan atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Practice Makes Perfect: A Study of Digital Twin Technology for Assembly and Problem-solving using Lunar Surface Telerobotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic systems that can traverse planetary or lunar surfaces to collect environmental data and perform physical manipulation tasks, such as assembling equipment or conducting mining operations, are envisioned to form the backbone of future human activities in space. However, the environmental conditions in which these robots, or "rovers," operate present challenges toward achieving fully autonomous solutions, meaning that rover missions will require some degree of human teleoperation or supervision for the foreseeable future. As a result, human operators require training to successfully direct rovers and avoid costly errors or mission failures, as well as the ability to recover from any issues that arise on the fly during mission activities. While analog environments, such as JPL's Mars Yard, can help with such training by simulating surface environments in the real world, access to such resources may be rare and expensive. As an alternative or supplement to such physical analogs, we explore the design and evaluation of a virtual reality digital twin system to train human teleoperation of robotic rovers with mechanical arms for space mission activities. We conducted an experiment with 24 human operators to investigate how our digital twin system can support human teleoperation of rovers in both pre-mission training and in real-time problem solving in a mock lunar mission in which users directed a physical rover in the context of deploying dipole radio antennas. We found that operators who first trained with the digital twin showed a 28% decrease in mission completion time, an 85% decrease in unrecoverable errors, as well as improved mental markers, including decreased cognitive load and increased situation awareness.</description>

      <title>Tracking Reentries of Starlink Satellites During the Rising Phase of Solar Cycle 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential increase of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites in the past 5 years has brought into intense focus the need for reliable monitoring and reentry prediction to safeguard from space collisions and ground debris impacts. However, LEO satellites fly within the upper atmosphere region that exerts significant drag forces to their orbits, reducing their lifetimes, and increasing collision risks during dynamic events, like geomagnetic storms. Such conditions can become more severe during geomagnetic storms, particularly during extreme events. In this work, we use two-line element (TLE) satellite tracking data to investigate geomagnetic activity effects on the reentries of 523 Starlink satellites from 2020 to 2024. This period coincides with the rising phase of solar cycle 25, which has shown itself to be more intense than the previous solar cycle. We derive satellite altitudes and velocities from TLE files and perform a superposed epoch analysis, the first with hundreds of similar satellites. Even with limitedly accurate TLE data, our results indisputably show that satellites reenter faster with higher geomagnetic activity. This is explained by the fastest orbital decay rates (in km/day) of the satellites caused by increased drag forces. We also find that prediction errors, defined as the difference between the epochs of actual reentries and predicted reentries at reference altitudes, increase with geomagnetic activity. As a result, we clearly show that the intense solar activity of the current solar cycle has already had significant impacts on Starlink reentries. This is a very exciting time in satellite orbital drag research, since the number of satellites in LEO and solar activity are the highest ever observed in human history.</description>

      <title>A model of magnetised and rotating convection for stellar and planetary interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection is a fundamental mechanism for energy transport in stars and planets, playing a pivotal role in shaping their structures and evolution. The Mixing-Length Theory, a monomodal approach to convection, is widely adopted and implemented in 1D stellar structure and evolution codes. However, it overlooks the combined effects of rotation and magnetic fields, which are ubiquitous across a wide range of stars and planets. To address this limitation, we extend the Mixing-Length Theory including both rotation and magnetic fields within a Cartesian set-up. Building on the work by Stevenson 1979, we use a heat-flux maximisation principle, which amounts to selecting the convective mode that carries the most heat. Our findings show that both rotation and magnetic fields individually tend to suppress convection. However, when combined, they can enhance convection strength under certain conditions. We derive expressions for the root-mean-square (rms) velocity, characteristic length scale, and degree of superadiabaticity as functions of the rotation rate and magnetic field strength. These results offer new insights for more accurately modeling convection and its impact on stellar and planetary structures in one-dimensional and forthcoming multi-dimensional evolution models.</description>

      <title>The role of interior dynamics and differentiation on the surface and atmosphere of lava planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lava planets are rocky exoplanets that orbit so close to their host star that their day-side is hot enough to melt silicate rock. Their short orbital periods ensure that lava planets are tidally locked into synchronous rotation, with permanent day and night hemispheres. Such asymmetric magma oceans have no analogs in the Solar System and will exhibit novel fluid dynamics.
  Here we report numerical simulations of lava planet interiors showing that solid-liquid fractionation in the planetary interior has a major impact on the compositional structure and evolution of the planet. We explored two styles of dynamics that depend primarily on the interior thermal state : 1) a hot fully molten interior, and 2) a mostly solid interior with a shallow day-side magma ocean.
  In the hot interior scenario, the atmosphere reflects the planet's bulk silicate composition and the night-side crust is gravitationally unstable and constantly replenished. In the cool interior scenario, the distilled atmosphere will lack Na, K and FeO, and the night-side mantle is entirely solid, with a cold surface. These two end-member cases can be distinguished with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, offering an avenue to probe the diversity of terrestrial exoplanet evolutions.</description>

      <title>Using the helium triplet as a tracer of the physics of giant planet outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic outflows, such as those observed escaping close-in gas giant planets, are not isothermal in structure. Their highly ionized nature allows them to cool adiabatically at distances beyond several planetary radii. The contrast between the hottest gas temperatures at around 10,000K and the coldest at around 1,000K triggers an excess population of the observable helium triplet. This excess is caused by the suppression of collisional de-excitation from the triplet state at cool temperatures. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we show that this helium triplet excess may explain the excess broadening seen in HD 189733b's observed transmission spectrum, demonstrating adiabatic cooling of its outflow, confirming its hydrodynamic nature on scales of several planetary radii. However, further observations are required to confirm this conclusion. Furthermore, we explore a range of electron transitions for neutral helium which were not considered in the previous literature. We find that the He$2^1$S state is unavailable as a potential reservoir for He$2^3$S electrons. Additionally, the de-excitation to the ground state must be considered for stellar spectra later than K2 in predicting the correct helium triplet population. Importantly, since triplet helium inherits momentum from ionized helium as it is generated by recombination, it is significantly less prone to fractionation than ground-state neutral helium. However at separations of $\gtrsim 0.05$~au, ionization at the flow base and drag on helium weaken, leading to significant fractionation of the then mostly neutral helium. This in turn, can cause a suppression of the Helium transit depth, even though the helium line width remains large.</description>

      <title>Evolution of steam worlds: energetic aspects</title>

Abstract: Sub-Neptunes occupy an intriguing region of planetary mass-radius space, where theoretical models of interior structure predict that they could be water-rich, where water is in steam and supercritical state. Such planets are expected to evolve according to the same principles as canonical H$_2$-He rich planets, but models that assume a water-dominated atmosphere consistent with the interior have not been developed yet. Here, we present a state of the art structure and evolution model for water-rich sub-Neptunes. Our set-up combines an existing atmosphere model that controls the heat loss from the planet, and an interior model that acts as the reservoir of energy. We compute evolutionary tracks of planetary radius over time. We find that planets with pure water envelopes have smaller radii than predicted by previous models, and the change in radius is much slower (within $\sim$10\%). We also find that water in the deep interior is colder than previously suggested, and can transition from plasma state to superionic ice, which can have additional implications for their evolution. We provide a grid of evolutionary tracks that can be used to infer the bulk water content of sub-Neptunes. We compare the bulk water content inferred by this model and other models available in the literature, and find statistically significant differences between models when the uncertainty on measured mass and radius are both smaller than 10\%. This study shows the importance of pursuing efforts in the modeling of volatile-rich planets, and how to connect them to observations.</description>

      <title>Detecting Exomoons in Free-Floating-Planet Events from Space-based Microlensing Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a planet is ejected from its star-planet system due to dynamical interactions, its satellite may remain gravitationally bound to the planet. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will be capable of detecting a large number of low-mass free-floating planet events (FFPs) from a bulge microlensing survey. We assess the feasibility of detecting satellites (a.k.a., exomoons) orbiting FFPs by simulating CSST light curves and calculating the detection efficiency as a function of satellite-to-planet mass ratios (q) and projected separations (s) in units of the Einstein radius. For a Neptune-class FFP in the Galactic disk with a Sun-like star as the microlensed source, CSST can detect Earth-mass satellites over a decade of separations (from ~0.01 to ~0.1 AU) and has sensitivity down to Moon-mass satellites (q~1e-3) at s~1. CSST also has some sensitivity to detect Moon-mass satellites at s~2 (~0.02 AU) orbiting an Earth-mass FFP in the disk. CSST has substantially reduced sensitivity for detecting satellites when the source star is an M dwarf, compared to a Sun-like source. We also calculate the satellite detection efficiency for the dedicated microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), which demonstrates greater sensitivity than CSST, particularly for M-dwarf sources. Notably, some of the Neptune-Earth systems detectable by CSST and Roman may exhibit significant tidal heating.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++: Enhanced Transit Classification and a New Vetting Catalog for 2-Minute TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09790v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage multi-source training by combining high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope with TESS data. This approach mitigates the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalog containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.</description>
