      <title>Exploring coherent dynamics in resonant x-ray scattering of intense ultrafast pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) offer unique opportunities to control inner-shell electrons on ultrafast timescales. This study presents a theoretical framework for modeling resonant x-ray scattering under intense ultrafast pulses, focusing on the coherent dynamics of Rabi oscillations. We employ a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation approach to investigate the effects of high-intensity pulses on the single atom response which includes resonant fluorescence and elastic scattering channels, and competing decay processes. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of scattering responses to pulse parameters and initial states, with interference effects playing a significant role.</description>

      <title>Magnetically generated spin-orbit coupling for ultracold atoms with slowly varying periodic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) affecting the center of mass of ultracold atoms can be simulated using a properly chosen periodic sequence of magnetic pulses. Yet such a method is generally accompanied by micro-motion which hinders a precise control of atomic dynamics and thus complicating practical applications. Here we show how to by-pass the micro-motion emerging in the magnetically induced SOC by switching on and off properly the oscillating magnetic fields at the initial and final times. We consider the exact dynamics of the system and demonstrate that the overall dynamics can be immune to the micro-motion. The exact dynamics is shown to agree well with the evolution of the system described by slowly changing effective Floquet Hamiltonian including the SOC term. The agreement is shown to be the best when the phase of the periodic driving takes a specific value for which the effect of the spin-orbit coupling is maximum.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity remote entanglement of trapped atoms mediated by time-bin photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic interconnects between quantum processing nodes are likely the only way to achieve large-scale quantum computers and networks. The bottleneck in such an architecture is the interface between well-isolated quantum memories and flying photons. We establish high-fidelity entanglement between remotely separated trapped atomic qubit memories, mediated by photonic qubits stored in the timing of their pulses. Such time-bin encoding removes sensitivity to polarization errors, enables long-distance quantum communication, and is extensible to quantum memories with more than two states. Using a measurement-based error detection process and suppressing a fundamental source of error due to atomic recoil, we achieve an entanglement fidelity of 97% and show that fidelities beyond 99.9% are feasible.</description>

      <title>Constraining P and T Violating Forces with Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New sources of parity and time reversal violation are predicted by well motivated extensions of the Standard Model and can be effectively probed by precision spectroscopy of atoms and molecules. Chiral molecules have distinguished enantiomers which are related by parity transformation. Thus, they are promising candidates to search for parity violation at molecular scales, yet to be observed. In this work, we show that precision spectroscopy of the hyperfine structure of chiral molecules is sensitive to new physics sources of parity and time reversal violation. In particular, such a study can be sensitive to regions unexplored by terrestial experiments of a new chiral spin-1 particle that couples to nucleons. We explore the potential to hunt for time reversal violation in chiral molecules and show that it can be a complementary measurement to other probes. We assess the feasibility of such hyperfine metrology and project the sensitivity in CHDBrI$^+$.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Erasure Conversion in a Molecular Tweezer Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable optical tweezer arrays of molecules are an emerging platform for quantum simulation and quantum information science. For these applications, reducing and mitigating errors that arise during initial state preparation and subsequent evolution remain major challenges. In this paper, we present work on site-resolved detection of internal state errors and quantum erasures, which are qubit errors with known locations. First, using a new site-resolved detection scheme, we demonstrate robust and enhanced tweezer array preparation fidelities. This enables creating molecular arrays with low defect rates, opening the door to high-fidelity simulation of quantum many-body systems. Second, for the first time in molecules, we demonstrate mid-circuit detection of erasures using a composite detection scheme that minimally affects error-free qubits. We also demonstrate mid-circuit conversion of blackbody-induced errors into detectable erasures. Our demonstration of erasure conversion, which has been shown to significantly reduce overheads for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, could be useful for quantum information processing in molecular tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Rapidly Rotating Bose-Einstein Quantum Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work theoretically investigates \textcolor{black}{the stationary properties} and the dynamics of the rotating quantum liquid droplets confined in a two-dimensional symmetric anharmonic trap. Mimicking the quantum Hall systems, the modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation with the inclusion of the Lee-Huang-Yang nonlinear interaction is analytically solved, and the role of the Landau-level mixing effect is addressed. \textcolor{black}{Via controlling the nonlinear interaction and the rotation speed, the rotating quantum droplet with multiply quantized vortex can be created, and the preference of the energetically favored quantum states can be distinguished in the phase diagram. To better interpret the underlying physics of the phase singularities, a brief comparison of the rotating quantum droplet and the optical vortex is made. The investigation of the long-term evolution of the rotating quantum droplets confirms the stability of the quantum states. At certain rotation speeds, the multi-periodic trajectories and breathings provide evidence of the emergence of the collective excitation of the surface mode in the vortex state. For quantum droplets carrying multiply quantized vortex, the microscopic snapshots of the rotation field adjusted current density distribution show that the combined nonlinear interaction and the anharmonic trapping potential can provide the restoring force to lead the quantum droplet to a regular and stable revolution and reach the dynamic equilibrium, revealing the signature of the generation of superfluids in the new kind of low-dimensional quantum liquids.</description>
