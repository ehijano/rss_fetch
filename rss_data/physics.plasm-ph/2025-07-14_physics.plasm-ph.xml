      <title>Volume-Preserving Deformation of Honeycomb Wire Media Enables Broad Plasma Frequency Tunability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate tunability of the plasma frequency in a wire medium by mechanically deforming a lattice of parallel metallic wires arranged at the nodes of a honeycomb structure. Numerical simulations predict up to 78% tunability and a proof-of-concept experiment confirms 64%.</description>

      <title>Vidyut3d: a GPU accelerated fluid solver for non-equilibrium plasmas on adaptive grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the numerical methods, programming methodology, verification, and performance assessment of a non-equilibrium plasma fluid solver that can effectively utilize current and upcoming central processing and graphics processing unit (CPU+GPU) architectures, in this work. Our plasma fluid model solves the coupled conservation equations for species transport, electrostatic Poisson and electron temperature on adaptive Cartesian grids. Our solver is written using performance portable adaptive-grid/particle management library, AMReX, and is portable over widely available vendor specific GPU architectures. We present verification of our solver using method of manufactured solutions that indicate formal second order accuracy with central diffusion and fifth-order weighted-essentially-non-oscillatory (WENO) advection scheme. We also verify our solver with published literature on capacitive discharges and atmospheric pressure streamer propagation. We demonstrate the use of our solver on two 3D simulation cases: an atmospheric streamer propagation in Ar-H2 mixtures and a low pressure twin electrode radio frequency reactor. Our performance studies on three different CPU+GPU architectures indicate approximately 150-400X speed-up using AMD and NVIDIA GPUs per time step compared to a single CPU core for a 4 million cell simulation with 15 species.</description>

      <title>Edge Radial Electric Field in Positive and Negative Triangularity Plasmas in the TCV Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first edge $E_r$ measurements in negative triangularity (NT) TCV plasmas. The Doppler backscattering measurements of $v_\perp \approx E_r/B$ reveal a significant impact of triangularity on the $E_r$ well: In Ohmic, NBI, and ECRH heated discharges, the $E_r$ well and associated $E_r \times B$ shear are stronger in NT-shaped plasmas compared to their positive triangularity (PT) counterpart. This suggests a connection to the concomitant NT performance gain relative to PT L-mode.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification of a multi-component Hall thruster model at varying facility pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is applied to calibrate and quantify prediction uncertainty in a coupled multi-component Hall thruster model at varying facility background pressures. The model, consisting of a cathode model, discharge model, and plume model, is used to simulate two thrusters across a range of background pressures in multiple vacuum test facilities. The model outputs include thruster performance metrics, one-dimensional plasma properties, and the angular distribution of the current density in the plume. The simulated thrusters include a magnetically shielded thruster, the H9, and an unshielded thruster, the SPT-100. After calibration, the model captures several key performance trends with background pressure, including changes in thrust and upstream shifts in the ion acceleration region. Furthermore, the model exhibits predictive accuracy to within 10\% when evaluated on flow rates and pressures not included in the training data, and the model can predict some performance characteristics across test facilities to within the same range. Evaluated on the same data as prior work [Eckels et al. 2024], the model reduced predictive errors in thrust and discharge current by greater than 50%. An extrapolation to on-orbit performance is performed with an error of 9\%, capturing trends in discharge current but not thrust. Possible extensions and improvements are discussed in the context of using data for predictive Hall thruster modeling across vacuum facilities.</description>

      <title>Universal energy limits of radiation belts in planetary and brown dwarf magnetospheric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation belts are regions of magnetically trapped particle radiation found around all of the sufficiently magnetized planets in the Solar System and recently also observed around brown dwarfs, yet despite their ubiquity, there is not yet a general theory or model to predict the uppermost energy limits that any particular magnetospheric system's radiation belts can attain. By considering only the most fundamental loss processes, a model and corresponding theory are developed that successfully bound and explain the maximum observed energies of all documented radiation belt systems. Interestingly, this approach yields a relatively simple function for the uppermost energy limit that depends on only the surface magnetic field strength of the system. The model predicts an energy limit for all radiation belt systems that asymptotes at 7 +/- 2 TeV (for protons and electrons), offering intriguing new insight on potential sources of galactic cosmic rays. This model is also applied to an exoplanetary system, demonstrating that the planet is likely a synchrotron emitter and showcasing the model's use for identifying candidate targets for synchrotron-emitting astrophysical systems and revealing details critical to habitability at those remote worlds.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the ECRIPAC accelerator concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Plasma ACcelerator (ECRIPAC) is an original concept for a plasma-based particle accelerator able to generate pulsed ion beams with adjustable energy, targeting mostly medical applications. In a complementary letter (Cernuschi et al., arXiv:2507.07827) we thoroughly reviewed and corrected the current literature on the subject, including also an original theoretical investigation on the influence of several physical parameters on the accelerator stability. This study led to the proposal of a compact demonstrator device, which has been validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The present paper provides a detailed and more extended explanation of the ECRIPAC working principle and physics, including mathematical derivations for several physical formulas. Moreover, several other parameters have been included in the accelerator stability study, providing an overview of achievable external fields and plasma characteristics allowing a stable ion acceleration.</description>

      <title>Plasma instability in the front of ejected energetic electrons and Type III solar radiobursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type III radio bursts are a signature of the flux of near-relativistic electrons ejected during solar flares. These bursts are frequently observed by spacecraft such as the Parker Solar Probe. It is traditionally believed that these electron beams generate Langmuir waves through the two-stream instability, which are then converted into electromagnetic waves. In this study, we revise that model by examining how the electron distribution becomes truncated due to the "time-of-flight" effect as the beam travels through a randomly inhomogeneous, and gently varying solar-wind plasma. Rather than the two-stream instability, this truncation destabilizes the distribution and leads to the generation of Langmuir waves via a linear instability; we confine our analysis to this linear regime and do not take into account the back reaction of the generated Langmuir waves on the electron distribution, which is nonlinear. The instability grows until slower electrons arrive and dampen the waves. Our qualitative analysis shows that the resulting wave intensity growth and decay closely match the intensity-time profile of observed Type III radio bursts at the fundamental frequency, supporting this modified theory.</description>

      <title>The Energy Cascade Rate in Supersonic Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) are implemented to investigate the energy cascade rate in compressible isothermal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Utilizing an exact law derived from the K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation, we examine the contributions of flux and non-flux terms to the cascade rate across a broad range of sonic and Alfv\'enic Mach numbers, from subsonic to supersonic regimes and varying mean magnetic fields. Cascade rates are computed using on-grid 3-D decomposition and two plasma increment approaches: signed and absolute values. Anisotropy induced by strong magnetic fields is analyzed through angular-dependent scaling of the cascade terms. Moreover, the increment calculation method significantly influences the relative contributions of flux and non-flux terms, with absolute methods tending to overestimate the latter. These findings extend current studies of compressible turbulence and offer critical insights into energy transfer mechanisms relevant to many astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Design of an Active Thomson Parabola for the detection of ions accelerated by laser: Numerical simulations and characterization of different solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article describes the development of an active Thomson Parabola ion spectrometer designed to measure the energy spectra of different multi-MeV ion species generated in laser-plasmas interactions. To do so, GEANT4 optical simulations were carried out in order to design and build a spectrometer based on scintillator detectors capable of operating at rates comparable with the highest achievable at any existing or upcoming high intensity laser facilities. Details on the different configurations simulated and their characterization are discussed.</description>
