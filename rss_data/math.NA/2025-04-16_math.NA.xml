      <title>On an efficient line smoother for the p-multigrid {\gamma}-cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the development of a Poisson solver for the spectral element discretization used in the GeoFluid Object Workbench (GeoFLOW) code, we propose a solver for the linear system arising from a Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto global spectral method. We precondition using a p-multigrid {\gamma}-cycle with highly-vectorizable smoothers, that we refer to as line smoothers. Our smoothers are restrictions of spectral and finite element discretizations to low-order one-dimensional problems along lines, that are solved by a reformulation of cyclic reduction as a direct multigrid method. We illustrate our method with numerical experiments showing the apparent boundedness of the iteration count for a fixed residual reduction over a range of moderately deformed domains, right hand sides and Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A broken Hardy inequality on finite element space and application to strain gradient elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We illustrate a broken Hardy inequality on discontinuous finite element spaces, blowing up with a logarithmic factor with respect to the meshes size. This is motivated by numerical analysis for the strain gradient elasticity with natural boundary conditions. A mixed finite element pair is employed to solve this model with nearly incompressible materials. This pair is quasi-stable with a logarithmic factor, which is not significant in the approximation error, and converges robustly in the incompressible limit and uniformly in the microscopic material parameter. Numerical results back up that the theoretical predictions are nearly optimal. Moreover, the regularity estimates for the model over a smooth domain have been proved with the aid of the Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg theory.</description>

      <title>A study of troubled-cell indicators applied to finite volume methods using a novel monotonicity parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt a troubled-cell indicator developed for discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to the finite volume method (FVM) framework for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. This indicator depends solely on the cell-average data of the target cell and its immediate neighbours. Once the troubled-cells are identified, we apply the limiter only in these cells instead of applying in all computational cells. We introduce a novel technique to quantify the quality of the solution in the neighbourhood of the shock by defining a monotonicity parameter $\mu$. Numerical results from various two-dimensional simulations on the hyperbolic systems of Euler equations using a finite volume solver employing MUSCL reconstruction validate the performance of the troubled-cell indicator and the approach of limiting only in the troubled-cells. These results show that limiting only in the troubled-cells is preferable to limiting everywhere as it improves convergence without compromising on the solution accuracy.</description>

      <title>A fully variational numerical method for structural topology optimization based on a Cahn-Hilliard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a novel numerical method suitable for the solution of topology optimization problems in solid mechanics. The most salient feature of the new approach is that the space and time discrete equations of the numerical method can be obtained as the optimality conditions of a single incremental potential. The governing equations define a gradient flow of the mass in the domain that maximizes the stiffness of the proposed solid, while exactly preserving the mass of the allocated material. Moreover, we propose a change of variables in the model equations that constrains the value of the density within admissible bounds and a continuation strategy that speeds up the evolution of the flow. The proposed strategy results in a robust and efficient topology optimization method that is exactly mass-preserving, does not employ Lagrange multipliers, and is fully variational.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Network Architecture Search Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has been indispensable in scientific and engineering applications. Recently, deep learning methods have been widely used to solve high-dimensional problems, one of which is the physics-informed neural network (PINN). Typically, a deep learning method has three main components: a neural network, a loss function, and an optimizer. While the construction of the loss function is rooted in the definition of solution space, how to choose a optimal neural network is somewhat ad hoc, leaving much room for improvement. In the framework of PINN, we propose an unsupervised network architecture search method for solving PDEs, termed PINN-DARTS, which applies the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) to find the optimal network architecture structure in a given set of neural networks. In this set, the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer can change. In the searching phase, both network and architecture parameters are updated simultaneously, so the running time is close to that of PINN with a pre-determined network structure. Unlike available works, our approach is unsupervised and purely based on the PDE residual without any prior usage of solutions. PINN-DARTS outputs the optimal network structure as well as the associated numerical solution. The performance of PINN-DARTS is verified on several benchmark PDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, wave, and Burgers' equations. Compared to traditional architecture search methods, PINN-DARTS achieves significantly higher architectural accuracy. Another interesting observation is that both the solution complexity and the PDE type have a prominent impact on the optimal network architecture. Our study suggests that architectures with uneven widths from layer to layer may have superior performance across different solution complexities and different PDE types.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank SPIKE Framework for Solving Large Sparse Linear Systems with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SPIKE family of linear system solvers provides parallelism using a block tridiagonal partitioning. Typically SPIKE-based solvers are applied to banded systems, resulting in structured off-diagonal blocks with non-zeros elements restricted to relatively small submatrices comprising the band of the original matrix. In this work, a low-rank SVD based approximation of the off-diagonal blocks is investigated. This produces a representation which more effectively handles matrices with large, sparse bands. A set of flexible distributed solvers, the LR-SPIKE variants, are implemented. There are applicable to a wide range of applications -- from use as a "black-box" preconditioner which straightforwardly improves upon the classic Block Jacobi preconditioner, to use as a specialized "approximate direct solver." An investigation of the effectiveness of the new preconditioners for a selection of SuiteSparse matrices is performed, particularly focusing on matrices derived from 3D finite element simulations. In addition, the SPIKE approximate linear system solvers are also paired with the FEAST eigenvalue solver, where they are shown to be particularly effective due to the former's rapid convergence, and the latter's acceptance of loose linear system solver convergence, resulting in a combination which requires very few solver iterations.</description>

      <title>SDFs from Unoriented Point Clouds using Neural Variational Heat Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational approach for computing neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF) from unoriented point clouds. To this end, we replace the commonly used eikonal equation with the heat method, carrying over to the neural domain what has long been standard practice for computing distances on discrete surfaces. This yields two convex optimization problems for whose solution we employ neural networks: We first compute a neural approximation of the gradients of the unsigned distance field through a small time step of heat flow with weighted point cloud densities as initial data. Then we use it to compute a neural approximation of the SDF. We prove that the underlying variational problems are well-posed. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method provides state-of-the-art surface reconstruction and consistent SDF gradients. Furthermore, we show in a proof-of-concept that it is accurate enough for solving a PDE on the zero-level set.</description>

      <title>Optimal finite element approximations of monotone semilinear elliptic PDE with subcritical nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study iterative finite element approximations for the numerical approximation of semilinear elliptic boundary value problems with monotone nonlinear reactions of subcritical growth. The focus of our contribution is on an optimal a priori error estimate for a contractive Picard type iteration scheme on meshes that are locally refined towards possible corner singularities in polygonal domains. Our analysis involves, in particular, an elliptic regularity result in weighted Sobolev spaces and the use of the Trudinger inequality, which is instrumental in dealing with subcritically growing nonlinearities. A series of numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Implicit dual time-stepping positivity-preserving entropy-stable schemes for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the explicit high-order positivity-preserving entropy-stable spectral collocation schemes developed in [30, 34] for the three-dimensional (3D) compressible Navier Stokes equations to a time implicit formulation. The time derivative terms are discretized by using the first- and second-order implicit backward difference formulas (BDF1 and BDF2) that are well suited for solving steady-state and time-dependent viscous flows at high Reynolds numbers, respectively. The nonlinear system of discrete equations at each physical timestep is solved by using a dual time-stepping technique. The proposed scheme is provably entropy-stable and positivity-preserving and provides unconditional stability properties in the physical time. Numerical results demonstrating accuracy and positivity-preserving properties of the new dual time-stepping scheme are presented for supersonic viscous flows with strong shock waves and contact discontinuities.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Scalable Augmented Lagrangian preconditioners for Fictitious Domain problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optimal and scalable preconditioning techniques to solve linear systems of equations with a block two-by-two and three-by-three structure arising from fictitious domain problems and from finite element discretizations of immersed boundary methods. In particular, we propose two augmented Lagrangian-based preconditioners to accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers for these two classes of linear. We consider two relevant examples to illustrate the performance of these preconditioners when used in conjunction with flexible GMRES: the Poisson and the Stokes fictitious domain problems. A spectral analysis is established for both exact and inexact versions of these preconditioners. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the robustness of our preconditioning strategy through extensive numerical tests in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a multi-scale DeepOnet (Mscale-DeepOnet) is proposed to reduce the spectral bias of the DeepOnet in learning high-frequency mapping between highly oscillatory functions, with an application to the nonlinear mapping between the coefficient of the Helmholtz equation and its solution. The Mscale-DeepOnet introduces the multiscale neural network in the branch and trunk networks of the original DeepOnet, the resulting Mscale-DeepOnet is shown to be able to capture various high-frequency components of the mapping itself and its image. Numerical results demonstrate the substantial improvement of the Mscale-DeepOnet for the problem of wave scattering in the high-frequency regime over the normal DeepOnet with a similar number of network parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a semidiscrete scheme for approximation of entropy solutions of one-dimensional scalar conservation laws with nonnegative initial data. The scheme is based on the concept of particle paths for conservation laws and can be interpreted as a finite-particle discretization. A convergence rate of order $1/2$ with respect to initial particle spacing is proved. As a special case, this covers the convergence of the Follow--the--Leader model to the Lighthill--Whitham--Richards model for traffic flow.</description>

      <title>Characterizing High Schmidt Number Witnesses in Arbitrary Dimensions System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A profound comprehension of quantum entanglement is crucial for the progression of quantum technologies. The degree of entanglement can be assessed by enumerating the entangled degrees of freedom, leading to the determination of a parameter known as the Schmidt number. In this paper, we develop an efficient analytical tool for characterizing high Schmidt number witnesses for bipartite quantum states in arbitrary dimensions. Our methods not only offer viable mathematical methods for constructing high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses in theory but also simplify the quantification of entanglement and dimensionality. Most notably, we develop high-dimensional Schmidt number witnesses within arbitrary-dimensional systems, with our Schmidt witness coefficients relying solely on the operator Schmidt coefficient. Subsequently, we demonstrate our theoretical advancements and computational superiority by constructing Schmidt number witnesses in arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum systems with Schmidt numbers four and five.</description>

      <title>Predicting Wave Dynamics using Deep Learning with Multistep Integration Inspired Attention and Physics-Based Loss Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a physics-based deep learning framework for data-driven prediction of wave propagation in fluid media. The proposed approach, termed Multistep Integration-Inspired Attention (MI2A), combines a denoising-based convolutional autoencoder for reduced latent representation with an attention-based recurrent neural network with long-short-term memory cells for time evolution of reduced coordinates. This proposed architecture draws inspiration from classical linear multistep methods to enhance stability and long-horizon accuracy in latent-time integration. Despite the efficiency of hybrid neural architectures in modeling wave dynamics, autoregressive predictions are often prone to accumulating phase and amplitude errors over time. To mitigate this issue within the MI2A framework, we introduce a novel loss decomposition strategy that explicitly separates the training loss function into distinct phase and amplitude components. We assess the performance of MI2A against two baseline reduced-order models trained with standard mean-squared error loss: a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network and a variant using Luong-style attention. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MI2A model, we consider three benchmark wave propagation problems of increasing complexity, namely one-dimensional linear convection, the nonlinear viscous Burgers equation, and the two-dimensional Saint-Venant shallow water system. Our results demonstrate that the MI2A framework significantly improves the accuracy and stability of long-term predictions, accurately preserving wave amplitude and phase characteristics. Compared to the standard long-short term memory and attention-based models, MI2A-based deep learning exhibits superior generalization and temporal accuracy, making it a promising tool for real-time wave modeling.</description>

      <title>Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Trimmed NURBS Surfaces via Generalized Winding Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate evaluation of containment queries for regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces is important in many graphics and engineering applications. However, the algebraic complexity of surface-surface intersections makes gaps and overlaps between surfaces difficult to avoid for in-the-wild surface models. By considering this problem through the lens of the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape, we can define a containment query that is robust to model watertightness. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN on arbitrary curved surfaces would require some form of geometric discretization, potentially inducing containment misclassifications near boundary components. In contrast, our proposed method computes an accurate GWN directly on the curved geometry of the input model. We accomplish this using a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral using Stokes' theorem, which in turn permits an efficient adaptive quadrature calculation on the boundary and trimming curves of the model. While this is sufficient for "far-field" query points that are distant from the surface, we augment this approach for "near-field" query points (i.e., within a bounding box) and even those coincident to the surface patches via a strategy that directly identifies and accounts for the jump discontinuity in the scalar field. We demonstrate that our method of evaluating the GWN field is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. Furthermore, the derived containment query is robust to non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.</description>

      <title>Nodal auxiliary a posteriori error estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.06774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and explain key relations between a posteriori error estimates and subspace correction methods viewed as preconditioners for problems in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. We set the stage using the Finite Element Exterior Calculus and Nodal Auxiliary Space Preconditioning. This framework provides a systematic way to derive explicit residual estimators and estimators based on local problems which are upper and lower bounds of the true error. We show the applications to discretizations of $\delta d$, curl-curl, grad-div, Hodge Laplacian problems, and linear elasticity with weak symmetry. We also provide a new regular decomposition for singularly perturbed H(d) norms and parameter-independent error estimators. The only ingredients needed are: well-posedness of the problem and the existence of regular decomposition on continuous level.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Expectation Inference for Efficient Uncertainty Quantification and History Matching of Transient Darcy Flows in Porous Media with Random Parameters Under Distribution Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of Darcy flows using history matching is important for the evaluation and prediction of subsurface reservoir performance. Conventional methods aim to obtain the maximum a posterior or maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) using gradient-based, heuristic or ensemble-based methods. These methods can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems since forward simulation needs to be run iteratively as physical parameters are updated. In the current study, we propose a nonlinear expectation inference (NEI) method for efficient history matching and uncertainty quantification accounting for distribution or Knightian uncertainty. Forward simulation runs are conducted on prior realisations once, and then a range of expectations are computed in the data space based on subsets of prior realisations with no repetitive forward runs required. In NEI, no prior probability distribution for data is assumed. Instead, the probability distribution is assumed to be uncertain with prior and posterior uncertainty quantified by nonlinear expectations. The inferred result of NEI is the posterior subsets on which the expected flow rates are consistent with observation. The accuracy and efficiency of the new method are validated using single- and two-phase Darcy flows in 2D and 3D heterogeneous reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic theta methods for free stochastic differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce free probability analogues of the stochastic theta methods for free stochastic differential equations in this work. Assume that the drift coefficient of the free stochastic differential equations is operator Lipschitz and the diffusion coefficients are locally operator Lipschitz, we prove the strong convergence of the numerical methods. Moreover, we investigate the exponential stability in mean square of the equations and the numerical methods. In particular, the free stochastic theta methods with $\theta \in [1/2, 1]$ can inherit the exponential stability of original equations for any given step size. Our methods offer better stability than the free Euler-Maruyama method. Numerical results are reported to confirm these theoretical findings and show the efficiency of our methods compared with the free Euler-Maruyama method.</description>

      <title>A velocity-based moving mesh Discontinuous Galerkin method for the advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In convection-dominated flows, robustness of the spatial discretisation is a key property. While Interior Penalty Galerkin (IPG) methods already proved efficient in the situation of large mesh Peclet numbers, Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods are able to reduce the convection-dominance by moving the mesh. In this paper, we introduce and analyse a velocity-based moving mesh discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the solution of the linear advection-diffusion equation. By introducing a smooth parameterized velocity $\Tilde{V}$ that separates the flow into a mean flow, also called moving mesh velocity, and a remaining advection field $V-\Tilde{V}$, we made a convergence analysis based on the smoothness of the mesh velocity. Furthermore, the reduction of the advection speed improves the stability of an explicit time-stepping. Finally, by adapting the existing robust error criteria to this moving mesh situation, we derived robust \textit{a posteriori} error criteria that describe the potentially small deviation to the mean flow and include the information of a transition towards $V=\Tilde{V}$.</description>

      <title>On a perturbation analysis of Higham squared maximum Gaussian elimination growth matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian elimination is the most popular technique for solving a dense linear system. Large errors in this procedure can occur in floating point arithmetic when the matrix's growth factor is large. In the study of numerical linear algebra, it is often valuable to study and characterize the worst case examples. To this end, in their 1989 paper, Higham and Higham characterized the complete set of real n by n matrices that achieves the maximum growth factor under partial pivoting. Left undone is a sensitivity analysis for these matrices under perturbations. The growth factor of these and nearby matrices is the subject of this work. Through theoretical insights and empirical results, we illustrate the high sensitivity of the growth factor of these matrices to perturbations and show how subtle changes can be strategically applied to matrix entries to significantly reduce the growth.</description>

      <title>When big data actually are low-rank, or entrywise approximation of certain function-generated matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03250v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article concerns low-rank approximation of matrices generated by sampling a smooth function of two $m$-dimensional variables. We identify several misconceptions surrounding a claim that, for a specific class of analytic functions, such $n \times n$ matrices admit accurate entrywise approximation of rank that is independent of $m$ and grows as $\log(n)$ -- colloquially known as ''big-data matrices are approximately low-rank''. We provide a theoretical explanation of the numerical results presented in support of this claim, describing three narrower classes of functions for which function-generated matrices can be approximated within an entrywise error of order $\varepsilon$ with rank $\mathcal{O}(\log(n) \varepsilon^{-2} \log(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ that is independent of the dimension $m$: (i) functions of the inner product of the two variables, (ii) functions of the Euclidean distance between the variables, and (iii) shift-invariant positive-definite kernels. We extend our argument to tensor-train approximation of tensors generated with functions of the ''higher-order inner product'' of their multiple variables. We discuss our results in the context of low-rank approximation of (a) growing datasets and (b) attention in transformer neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the solution of the distributed control problem for the steady, incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. We propose an inexact Newton linearization of the optimality conditions. Upon discretization by a finite element scheme, we obtain a sequence of large symmetric linear systems of saddle-point type. We use an augmented Lagrangian-based block triangular preconditioner in combination with the flexible GMRES method at each Newton step. The preconditioner is applied inexactly via a suitable multigrid solver. Numerical experiments indicate that the resulting method appears to be fairly robust with respect to viscosity, mesh size, and the choice of regularization parameter when applied to 2D problems.</description>

      <title>Nested Bregman Iterations for Decomposition Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of image reconstruction while simultaneously decomposing the reconstructed image into components with different features. A commonly used tool for this is a variational approach with an infimal convolution of appropriate functions as a regularizer. Especially for noise corrupted observations, incorporating these functionals into the classical method of Bregman iterations provides a robust method for obtaining an overall good approximation of the true image, by stopping early the iteration according to a discrepancy principle. However, crucially, the quality of the separate components depends further on the proper choice of the regularization weights associated to the infimally convoluted functionals. Here, we propose the method of Nested Bregman iterations to improve a decomposition in a structured way. This allows to transform the task of choosing the weights into the problem of stopping the iteration according to a meaningful criterion based on normalized cross-correlation. We discuss the well-definedness and the convergence behavior of the proposed method, and illustrate its strength numerically with various image decomposition tasks employing infimal convolution functionals.</description>

      <title>Re-anchoring Quantum Monte Carlo with Tensor-Train Sketching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07194v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for improving the sampling efficiency and controlling the sign problem. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems. The overlap between the estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction also achieves high fidelity. We additionally provide a convergence analysis, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimation. From a complementary perspective, our algorithm also extends the reach of tensor-train methods for studying quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We construct a Neural Network that approximates the matrix multiplication operator for any activation function such that there exists a Neural Network which can approximate the scalar multiplication function. In particular, we use the Strassen algorithm to reduce the number of weights and layers needed for such Neural Networks. This allows us to define another Neural Network for approximating the inverse matrix operator. Also, by relying on the Galerkin method, we apply those Neural Networks to solve parametric elliptic PDEs for a whole set of parameters. Finally, we discuss improvements with respect to the prior results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate models are critical for accelerating computationally expensive simulations in science and engineering, particularly for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). Developing practical surrogate models poses significant challenges, particularly in handling geometrically complex and variable domains, which are often discretized as point clouds. In this work, we systematically investigate the formulation of neural operators -- maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces -- on point clouds to better handle complex and variable geometries while mitigating discretization effects. We introduce the Point Cloud Neural Operator (PCNO), designed to efficiently approximate solution maps of parametric PDEs on such domains. We evaluate the performance of PCNO on a range of pedagogical PDE problems, focusing on aspects such as boundary layers, adaptively meshed point clouds, and variable domains with topological variations. Its practicality is further demonstrated through three-dimensional applications, such as predicting pressure loads on various vehicle types and simulating the inflation process of intricate parachute structures.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with constructing an invariant-domain preserving approximation technique for the compressible Euler equations that preserves the minimum principle on the physical entropy. We show that any numerical method that can be written as a convex combination of good auxiliary states will satisfy the minimum principle on the physical entropy provided the equation of state satisfies some mild assumptions. Furthermore, we derive a wave speed estimate in an extended Riemann problem necessary for constructing the auxiliary states with desired properties. Finally, we numerically illustrate the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>What metric to optimize for suppressing instability in a Vlasov-Poisson system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizing plasma dynamics is an important task in green energy generation via nuclear fusion. One common strategy is to introduce an external field to prevent the plasma distribution from developing turbulence. However, finding such external fields efficiently remains an open question, even for simplified models such as the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. In this work, we leverage two different approaches to build such fields: for the first approach, we use an analytical derivation of the dispersion relation of the VP system to find a range of reasonable fields that can potentially suppress instability, providing a qualitative suggestion. For the second approach, we leverage PDE-constrained optimization to obtain a locally optimal field using different loss functions. As the stability of the system can be characterized in several different ways, the objective functions need to be tailored accordingly. We show, through extensive numerical tests, that objective functions such as the relative entropy (KL divergence) and the $L^{2}$ norm result in a highly non-convex problem, rendering the global minimum difficult to find. However, we show that using the electric energy of the system as a loss function is advantageous, as it has a large convex basin close to the global minimum. Unfortunately, outside the basin, the electric energy landscape consists of unphysical flat local minima, thus rendering a good initial guess key for the overall convergence of the optimization problem, particularly for solvers with adaptive steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00359v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world decision and optimization problems, often involve constraints and conflicting criteria. For example, choosing a travel method must balance speed, cost, environmental footprint, and convenience. Similarly, designing an industrial process must consider safety, environmental impact, and cost efficiency. Ideal solutions where all objectives are optimally met are rare; instead, we seek good compromises and aim to avoid lose-lose scenarios. Multicriteria optimization offers computational techniques to compute Pareto optimal solutions, aiding decision analysis and decision making. This reader offers an introduction to this topic and has been developed on the basis of the revised edition of the reader for the MSc computer science course "Multicriteria Optimization and Decision Analysis" at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, Leiden University, The Netherlands. This course was taught annually by the first author from 2007 to 2023 as a single semester course with lectures and practicals. Our aim was to make the material accessible to MSc students who do not study mathematics as their core discipline by introducing basic numerical analysis concepts when necessary and providing numerical examples for interesting cases. The introduction is organized in a unique didactic manner developed by the authors, starting from more simple concepts such as linear programming and single-point methods, and advancing from these to more difficult concepts such as optimality conditions for nonlinear optimization and set-oriented solution algorithms. Besides, we focus on the mathematical modeling and foundations rather than on specific algorithms, though not excluding the discussion of some representative examples of solution algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game (MFG) model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>

      <title>Resilience Against Soft Faults through Adaptivity in Spectral Deferred Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As supercomputers grow in hardware complexity, their susceptibility to faults increases and measures need to be taken to ensure the correctness of results. Some numerical algorithms have certain characteristics that allow them to recover from some types of faults. It has been demonstrated that adaptive Runge-Kutta methods provide resilience against transient faults without adding computational cost. Using recent advances in adaptive step size selection for spectral deferred correction (SDC), an iterative numerical time stepping scheme that can produce methods of arbitrary order, we show that adaptive SDC can also detect and correct transient faults. Its performance is found to be comparable to that of the dedicated resilience strategy Hot Rod.</description>

Abstract: We show the existence of Arnold diffusion in the planar full three-body problem, which is expressed as a perturbation of a Kepler problem and a planar circular restricted three-body problem, with the perturbation parameter being the mass of the smallest body. In this context, we obtain Arnold diffusion in terms of a transfer of energy, in an amount independent of the perturbation parameter, between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on a topological method based on correctly aligned windows which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. This approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, such as those in a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</description>
