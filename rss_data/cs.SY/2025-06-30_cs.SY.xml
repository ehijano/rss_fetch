      <title>Stochastic Neural Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are utilized to ensure the safety of control systems. CBFs act as safety filters in order to provide safety guarantees without compromising system performance. These safety guarantees rely on the construction of valid CBFs. Due to their complexity, CBFs can be represented by neural networks, known as neural CBFs (NCBFs). Existing works on the verification of the NCBF focus on the synthesis and verification of NCBFs in deterministic settings, leaving the stochastic NCBFs (SNCBFs) less studied. In this work, we propose a verifiably safe synthesis for SNCBFs. We consider the cases of smooth SNCBFs with twice-differentiable activation functions and SNCBFs that utilize the Rectified Linear Unit or ReLU activation function. We propose a verification-free synthesis framework for smooth SNCBFs and a verification-in-the-loop synthesis framework for both smooth and ReLU SNCBFs. and we validate our frameworks in three cases, namely, the inverted pendulum, Darboux, and the unicycle model.</description>

      <title>Online design of experiments by active learning for nonlinear system identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of active-learning (AL) strategies to generate the input excitation signal at runtime for system identification of linear and nonlinear autoregressive and state-space models. We adapt various existing AL approaches for static model regression to the dynamic context, coupling them with a Kalman filter to update the model parameters recursively, and also cope with the presence of input and output constraints. We show the increased sample efficiency of the proposed approaches with respect to random excitation on different nonlinear system identification benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Complex Phase Analysis of Power Grid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an increasing share of renewable energy sources, accurate and efficient modeling of grid-forming inverters is becoming crucial for system stability. Linear methods are a powerful tool for understanding dynamics close to an operating point, but usually depend on the reference trajectory. Thus, small deviations can render linear models invalid over time, posing a significant challenge in practice, and complicating theoretical analysis. As a solution, we show that the complex phase offers a robust formulation independent of reference phases and frequencies, thus preserving invariance properties under linearization. This enables robust system identification during realistic conditions and opens the road to powerful stability analysis of inverter-based grids.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic Discrete-Time Dynamic Games with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering linear-quadratic discrete-time games with unknown input/output/state (i/o/s) dynamics and state, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of feedback Nash equilibria (FNE) in the finite-horizon game, based entirely on offline input/output data. We prove that the finite-horizon unknown-dynamics game and its corresponding known-dynamics game have the same FNEs, and provide detailed relationships between their respective FNE matrices. To simplify the computation of FNEs, we provide an invertibility condition and a corresponding algorithm that computes one FNE by solving a finite number of linear equation systems using offline data. For the infinite-horizon unknown-dynamics game, limited offline data restricts players to computing optimal strategies only over a finite horizon. We prove that the finite-horizon strategy ``watching $T$ steps into the future and moving one step now,'' which is commonly used in classical optimal control, exhibits convergence in both the FNE matrices and the total costs in the infinite-horizon unknown-dynamics game, and further provide an analysis of the convergence rate of the total cost. The corresponding algorithm for the infinite-horizon game is proposed and its efficacy is demonstrated through a non-scalar numerical example.</description>

      <title>Learning Distributed Safe Multi-Agent Navigation via Infinite-Horizon Optimal Graph Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multi-agent navigation faces inherent challenges due to the competing requirements of maintaining safety and achieving goal-directed behavior, particularly for agents with limited sensing range operating in unknown environments with dense obstacles. Existing approaches typically project predefined goal-reaching controllers onto control barrier function (CBF) constraints, often resulting in conservative and suboptimal trade-offs between safety and goal-reaching performance. We propose an infinite-horizon CBF-constrained optimal graph control formulation for distributed safe multi-agent navigation. By deriving the analytical solution structure, we develop a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)-based learning framework to approximate the solution. In particular, our algorithm jointly learns a CBF and a distributed control policy, both parameterized by graph neural networks (GNNs), along with a value function that robustly guides agents toward their goals. Moreover, we introduce a state-dependent parameterization of Lagrange multipliers, enabling dynamic trade-offs between safety and performance. Unlike traditional short-horizon, quadratic programming-based CBF methods, our approach leverages long-horizon optimization to proactively avoid deadlocks and navigate complex environments more effectively. Extensive simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements in safety and task success rates across various agent dynamics, with strong scalability and generalization to large-scale teams in previously unseen environments. Real-world experiments using Crazyflie drone swarms on challenging antipodal position-swapping tasks further validate the practicality, generalizability, and robustness of the proposed HJB-GNN learning framework.</description>

      <title>A Matlab-based Toolbox for Automatic EMT Modeling and Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensive integration of power converters is changing the way that power systems operate, leading to the emergence of new types of dynamic phenomena and instabilities. At the same time, converters act as an interface between traditional AC grids and their more recent DC counterparts, giving rise to hybrid AC/DC networks. These conditions increase the necessity for stability analysis tools that can simultaneously account for the newly-introduced dynamic phenomena and can also be applied for the stability study of hybrid networks. This paper presents a Matlab-based toolbox for small-signal analysis of hybrid AC/DC power systems considering electromagnetic-transient (EMT) models. The toolbox allows the automatized modeling of the system from the input data and offers options for modal, impedance and passivity analyses. In the paper, the structure and internal processes of the toolbox are duly discussed, together with all its features, both main and complementary. Its capabilities for stability analysis are demonstrated via comprehensive case studies of converter-based system of various size and topology.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Intrusion Detection in Vehicles: Integrating Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of Cyber-Physical System (CPS), accurately identifying attacks without detailed knowledge of the system's parameters remains a major challenge. When it comes to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), identifying the parameters of vehicle dynamics could be impractical or prohibitively costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework for attack detection in vehicles that effectively addresses the uncertainty in their dynamics. Our method integrates the widely used Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), a well-known technique for nonlinear state estimation in dynamic systems, with machine learning algorithms. This combination eliminates the requirement for precise vehicle modeling in the detection process, enhancing the system's adaptability and accuracy. To validate the efficacy and practicality of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive comparative simulations by introducing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the vehicle systems' sensors and actuators.</description>

      <title>Economic Model Predictive Control with a Non-Fixed Reference Trajectory for Optimal Microgrid Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC), instead of stabilizing a reference trajectory/state in the objective function like a Tracking MPC, optimizes the economic performance over the prediction horizon, making it attractive for economical microgrid (MG) dispatch. However, the demand charge component in the monthly electricity cost, make it difficult to be encapsulated in additive stage costs, and can make solutions violate the principle of optimality if naively introduced in the objective function. Moreover, previous EMPC based works mostly rely on a-priori knowledge of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory for performance guarantees, which are not useful or possibly don't exist respectively, for real-time economical MG dispatch where load/generation forecasts are known only 24-48 h in advance. This paper, first, proposes an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear time varying system with hard state and input constraints, without any a-priori requirements of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory. It is proved that under mild assumptions on terminal cost and region, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse than the asymptotic average economic cost of any other non-fixed arbitrary reference trajectory which is known only until the current time-step. The EMPC framework is then leveraged for optimal MG dispatch by showing that the problem can be reformulated to satisfy the assumptions required for the asymptotic performance guarantee. Realistic simulations at the Port of San Diego MG demonstrated that the proposed method can also reduce monthly electricity costs in closed-loop with respect to reference trajectories generated by directly optimizing the electricity cost function over the prediction horizon or by tracking an ideal grid import curve in a majority of the cases.</description>

      <title>Spherical Pendulum with Quad-Rotor Thrust Vectoring Actuation -- A Novel Mechatronics and Control Benchmark Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor-actuated pendulums have been established as arguably the most common laboratory prototypes used in control system education because of the relevance to robot manipulator control in industry. Meanwhile, multi-rotor drones like quadcopters have become popular in industrial applications but have not been broadly employed in control education laboratory. Platforms with pendulums and multi-rotor copters present classical yet intriguing multi-degree of freedom (DoF) dynamics and coordinate systems for the control system investigation. In this paper, we introduce a novel control platform in which a 2-DoF pendulum capable of azimuth and elevation rotation is actuated through vectored thrust generated by a quadcopter. Designed as a benchmark for mechatronics and nonlinear control education and research, the system integrates detailed mechatronic implementation with different control strategies. Specifically, we apply and compare small perturbation linearization (SPL), state feedback linearization (SFL), and partial feedback linearization (PFL) to the nonlinear system dynamics. The performances are evaluated by time specifications of step response and Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error of trajectory tracking. The robustness of the closed-loop system is validated under external disturbances, and both simulation and experimental results are presented to highlight the strengths and limitations of the nonlinear model-based control approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents innovative solutions to critical challenges in planetary and deep-space exploration electronics. We synthesize findings across diverse mission profiles, highlighting advances in: (1) MARTIAN positioning systems with dual-frequency transmission to achieve $\pm$1m horizontal accuracy; (2) artificial reef platforms for Titan's hydrocarbon seas utilizing specialized sensor arrays and multi-stage communication chains; (3) precision orbital rendezvous techniques demonstrating novel thermal protection solutions; (4) miniaturized CubeSat architectures for asteroid exploration with optimized power-to-mass ratios; and (5) next-generation power management systems for MARS rovers addressing dust accumulation challenges. These innovations represent promising directions for future space exploration technologies, particularly in environments where traditional Earth-based electronic solutions prove inadequate. The interdisciplinary nature of these developments highlights the critical intersection of aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, and planetary science in advancing human exploration capabilities beyond Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>When Every Symbol Counts: Resilient Wireless Systems Under Finite Blocklength Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As 6G evolves, wireless networks become essential for critical operations and enable innovative applications that demand seamless adaptation to dynamic environments and disruptions. Because these vital services require uninterrupted operation, their resilience to unforeseen disruptions is essential. However, implementing resilience necessitates rapid recovery procedures, which operate in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime, where short packets and added error-correction overhead can severely degrade communication efficiency. Due to this performance loss, always attempting recovery can backfire and result in worse outcomes than simply enduring the disruption under longer blocklengths. In this work, we study these effects of FBL constraints within a resilience framework, incorporating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance adaptation capabilities. By actively shaping the wireless environment, RIS help counteract some of the performance losses caused by FBL, enabling more effective recovery from disruptions. Numerical results reveal two critical blocklength thresholds: the first enables full recovery from the FBL penalty, while the second, at a higher blocklength, allows the system to recover from both the FBL penalty and the initial disruption, yielding a significant improvement in resilience performance. Additionally, we show that the number of RIS elements shifts these thresholds, enabling faster reconfiguration with shorter blocklengths and providing insights to the trade-offs between rate, blocklength, and reconfiguration effort under FBL conditions.</description>

      <title>Performance Prediction for Large Systems via Text-to-Text Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However, such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization, achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal simulators of real-world outcomes.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of pose informed reinforcement learning for skid-steered visual navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling, especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.</description>

      <title>A MILP-Based Solution to Multi-Agent Motion Planning and Collision Avoidance in Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for multi-agent motion planning that embeds Polytopic Action-based Motion Planning (PAAMP) into a sequence-then-solve pipeline. Region sequences confine each agent to adjacent convex polytopes, while a big-M hyperplane model enforces inter-agent separation. Collision constraints are applied only to agents sharing or neighboring a region, which reduces binary variables exponentially compared with naive formulations. An L1 path-length-plus-acceleration cost yields smooth trajectories. We prove finite-time convergence and demonstrate on representative multi-agent scenarios with obstacles that our formulation produces collision-free trajectories an order of magnitude faster than an unstructured MILP baseline.</description>

      <title>Autonomic Microservice Management via Agentic AI and MAPE-K Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While microservices are revolutionizing cloud computing by offering unparalleled scalability and independent deployment, their decentralized nature poses significant security and management challenges that can threaten system stability. We propose a framework based on MAPE-K, which leverages agentic AI, for autonomous anomaly detection and remediation to address the daunting task of highly distributed system management. Our framework offers practical, industry-ready solutions for maintaining robust and secure microservices. Practitioners and researchers can customize the framework to enhance system stability, reduce downtime, and monitor broader system quality attributes such as system performance level, resilience, security, and anomaly management, among others.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Network Topology on the Equilibria of Influence-Opinion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online social networks exert a powerful influence on public opinion. Adversaries weaponize these networks to manipulate discourse, underscoring the need for more resilient social networks. To this end, we investigate the impact of network connectivity on Stackelberg equilibria in a two-player game to shape public opinion. We model opinion evolution as a repeated competitive influence-propagation process. Players iteratively inject \textit{messages} that diffuse until reaching a steady state, modeling the dispersion of two competing messages. Opinions then update according to the discounted sum of exposure to the messages. This bi-level model captures viral-media correlation effects omitted by standard opinion-dynamics models. To solve the resulting high-dimensional game, we propose a scalable, iterative algorithm based on linear-quadratic regulators that approximates local feedback Stackelberg strategies for players with limited cognition. We analyze how the network topology shapes equilibrium outcomes through experiments on synthetic networks and real Facebook data. Our results identify structural characteristics that improve a network's resilience to adversarial influence, guiding the design of more resilient social networks.</description>

      <title>Safe Control for Nonlinear Systems Under Faults and Attacks Via Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety is one of the most important properties of control systems. Sensor faults and attacks and actuator failures may cause errors in the sensor measurements and system dynamics, which leads to erroneous control inputs and hence safety violations. In this paper, we improve the robustness against sensor faults and actuator failures by proposing a class of Fault-Tolerant Control Barrier Functions (FT-CBFs) for nonlinear systems. Our approach maintains a set of state estimators according to fault patterns and incorporates CBF-based linear constraints for each state estimator. We then propose a framework for joint safety and stability by integrating FT-CBFs with Control Lyapunov Functions. With a similar philosophy of utilizing redundancy, we proposed High order CBF-based approach to ensure safety when actuator failures occur. We propose a sum-of-squares (SOS) based approach to verify the feasibility of FT-CBFs for both sensor faults and actuator failures. We evaluate our approach via two case studies, namely, a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) system in the presence of a sensor attack and a Boeing 747 lateral control system under actuator failures.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Metropolitan Carbon Emissions with Dynamic Eco-driving at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sheer scale and diversity of transportation make it a formidable sector to decarbonize. Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Subspace Identification for Stochastic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18853v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subspace identification method (SIM) has become a widely adopted approach for the identification of discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this paper, we derive finite sample high-probability error bounds for the system matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$ and the estimation of system poles. Specifically, we demonstrate that, ignoring the logarithmic factors, for an $n$-dimensional LTI system with no external inputs, the estimation error of these matrices decreases at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2n}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we reveal that achieving a constant estimation error requires a super-polynomial sample size in $n/m $, where $n/m$ denotes the state-to-output dimension ratio. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results.</description>

      <title>Release Date Optimization Using Clearing Functions in MRP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper integrates a clearing function (CF)-based release planning approach into Material Requirements Planning (MRP) to address its limitations in modeling capacity constraints and dynamic lead times. The proposed CF-based optimization model replaces MRP's backward scheduling step while preserving its overall structure. Performance is evaluated through simulation experiments on two flow shop systems: a compact three-level system with three shared resources (PS1) and a more complex four-stage system with 32 end items and 16 machines (PS2). The experiments explore a range of demand uncertainties and utilization levels. Results show that CF-based planning consistently reduces total costs and tardiness while improving schedule feasibility, particularly under imperfect forecasts. These findings demonstrate the potential of CFs to enhance MRP by introducing workload responsiveness and dynamic adaptability, without compromising computational tractability.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for Voltage Regulation and Current Sharing in DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs), loads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where the DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the inputs, outputs, and disturbances of DGs and lines are connected in a DC MG. Each DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller. To design the controllers, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and formulate a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of this problem, we identify a set of necessary local and global conditions to enforce in a specifically developed LMI-based local controller design process. In contrast to existing DC MG control solutions, our approach proposes a unified framework for co-designing the distributed controller and communication topology. As the co-design process is LMI-based, it can be efficiently implemented and evaluated using existing convex optimization tools. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by simulating an islanded DC MG in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under different scenarios, such as load changes and topological constraint changes, and then comparing the performance with the droop control algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the problem of tracking eigenvalue trajectories in large-scale power system models as system parameters vary. A continuation-based formulation is presented for tracing any single eigenvalue of interest, which supports sparse matrix representations and accommodates both explicit and semi-implicit differential-algebraic models. Key implementation aspects, such as numerical integration, matrix updates, derivative approximations, and handling defective eigenvalues, are discussed in detail and practical recommendations are duly provided. The tracking approach is demonstrated through a comprehensive case study on the IEEE 39-bus system, as well as on a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission system.</description>

      <title>Day-Ahead Bidding Strategies for Wind Farm Operators under a One-Price Balancing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study day-ahead bidding strategies for wind farm operators under a one-price balancing scheme, prevalent in European electricity markets. In this setting, the profit-maximising strategy becomes an all-or-nothing strategy, aiming to take advantage of open positions in the balancing market. However, balancing prices are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast in the day-ahead stage and large open positions can affect the balancing price by changing the direction of the system imbalance. This paper addresses day-ahead bidding as a decision-making problem under uncertainty, with the objective of maximising the expected profit while reducing the imbalance risk related to the strategy. To this end, we develop a stochastic optimisation problem with explicit constraints on the positions in the balancing market, providing risk certificates, and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Moreover, we show how the price-impact of the trading strategy on the balancing market can be included in the ex-post evaluation. Using real data from the Belgian electricity market and an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, we demonstrate that the all-or-nothing strategy negatively impacts the balancing price, resulting in long-term losses for the wind farm. Our risk-constrained strategy, however, can still significantly enhance operational profit compared to traditional point-forecast bidding.</description>

      <title>Finite-Horizon Strategy in Infinite-Horizon Linear-Quadratic Discrete-Time Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a finite-horizon strategy, ``watching $T$ steps into the future and moving one step now,'' in an $N$-person infinite-horizon discrete-time linear-quadratic dynamic game. The game involves linear input/output/state dynamics and quadratic cost functions with heterogeneous discount factors. For the finite-horizon version, which forms the basis of the infinite-horizon game, we analyze the structure of the coupled generalized discrete Riccati difference equations related to the feedback Nash equilibrium (FNE) and derive a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the finite-horizon FNE. Under this condition, the FNE can be efficiently computed via the proposed algorithm. In the infinite-horizon game, assume all players adopt this finite-horizon strategy. If the iterations of the coupled equations related to the FNE converge, and the invertibility and stability conditions hold, we prove the convergence of each player's total cost under the finite-horizon strategy, even when players use individual prediction horizons. Furthermore, we provide an explicit upper bound on the cost difference between the finite-horizon strategy and the infinite-horizon FNE associated with the limiting matrices, expressed via the distance between their feedback strategy matrices. This bound vanishes as $T$ tends to infinity, implying convergence to the infinite-horizon FNE cost. A non-scalar numerical example illustrates the convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Stability of Primal-Dual Gradient Flow Dynamics for Multi-Block Convex Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine stability properties of primal-dual gradient flow dynamics for composite convex optimization problems with multiple, possibly nonsmooth, terms in the objective function under the generalized consensus constraint. The proposed dynamics are based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian and they provide a viable alternative to ADMM which faces significant challenges from both analysis and implementation viewpoints in large-scale multi-block scenarios. In contrast to customized algorithms with individualized convergence guarantees, we develop a systematic approach for solving a broad class of challenging composite optimization problems. We leverage various structural properties to establish global (exponential) convergence guarantees for the proposed dynamics. Our assumptions are much weaker than those required to prove (exponential) stability of primal-dual dynamics as well as (linear) convergence of discrete-time methods such as standard two-block and multi-block ADMM and EXTRA algorithms. Finally, we show necessity of some of our structural assumptions for exponential stability and provide computational experiments to demonstrate the convenience of the proposed approach for parallel and distributed computing applications.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Bearing-Only Target Pursuit via Multiagent Reinforcement Learning: Design and Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the multi-robot pursuit problem for an unknown target, encompassing both target state estimation and pursuit control. First, in state estimation, we focus on using only bearing information, as it is readily available from vision sensors and effective for small, distant targets. Challenges such as instability due to the nonlinearity of bearing measurements and singularities in the two-angle representation are addressed through a proposed uniform bearing-only information filter. This filter integrates multiple 3D bearing measurements, provides a concise formulation, and enhances stability and resilience to target loss caused by limited field of view (FoV). Second, in target pursuit control within complex environments, where challenges such as heterogeneity and limited FoV arise, conventional methods like differential games or Voronoi partitioning often prove inadequate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, enabling multiple heterogeneous vehicles to search, localize, and follow a target while effectively handling those challenges. Third, to bridge the sim-to-real gap, we propose two key techniques: incorporating adjustable low-level control gains in training to replicate the dynamics of real-world autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), and proposing spectral-normalized RL algorithms to enhance policy smoothness and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the successful zero-shot transfer of the MARL controllers to AGVs, validating the effectiveness and practical feasibility of our approach.

      <title>Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks. Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at assessing the set of pathways through which AI systems pose direct or indirect risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity bands, and explicitly documenting evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities. The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. It introduces three methodological advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3) Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for lifecycle decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI developers, evaluators, and regulators.</description>

      <title>eCAV: An Edge-Assisted Evaluation Platform for Connected Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As autonomous vehicles edge closer to widespread adoption, enhancing road safety through collision avoidance and minimization of collateral damage becomes imperative. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, which include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-cloud (V2C), are being proposed as mechanisms to achieve this safety improvement.
  Simulation-based testing is crucial for early-stage evaluation of Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) control systems, offering a safer and more cost-effective alternative to real-world tests. However, simulating large 3D environments with many complex single- and multi-vehicle sensors and controllers is computationally intensive. There is currently no evaluation framework that can effectively evaluate realistic scenarios involving large numbers of autonomous vehicles.
  We propose eCAV -- an efficient, modular, and scalable evaluation platform to facilitate both functional validation of algorithmic approaches to increasing road safety, as well as performance prediction of algorithms of various V2X technologies, including a futuristic Vehicle-to-Edge control plane and correspondingly designed control algorithms. eCAV can model up to 256 vehicles running individual control algorithms without perception enabled, which is $8\times$ more vehicles than what is possible with state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

Abstract: External factors, including urban canyons and adversarial interference, can lead to Global Positioning System (GPS) inaccuracies that vary as a function of the position in the environment. This study addresses the challenge of estimating a static, spatially-varying error function using a team of robots. We introduce a State Bias Estimation Algorithm (SBE) whose purpose is to estimate the GPS biases. The central idea is to use sensed estimates of the range and bearing to the other robots in the team to estimate changes in bias across the environment. A set of drones moves in a 2D environment, each sampling data from GPS, range, and bearing sensors. The biases calculated by the SBE at estimated positions are used to train a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. We use a Sparse Gaussian process-based Informative Path Planning (IPP) algorithm that identifies high-value regions of the environment for data collection. The swarm plans paths that maximize information gain in each iteration, further refining their understanding of the environment's positional bias landscape. We evaluated SBE and IPP in simulation and compared the IPP methodology to an open-loop strategy.</description>
