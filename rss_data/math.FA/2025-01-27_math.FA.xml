      <title>Bounded Toeplitz Products on the Hardy Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Toeplitz operator on the Hardy space of the unit circle is bounded if and only if its symbol is bounded. For two Toeplitz operators, there are no known function-theoretic conditions for their symbols, which are equivalent to the product of the Toeplitz operators being bounded. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem, by showing under certain assumptions that the product of two Toeplitz operators is bounded if and only if the product of their symbols is bounded.</description>

      <title>Left invertible quasi-isometric liftings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-isometric liftings similar to isometries, for the operators similar to contractions in Hilbert spaces, are investigated. The existence of such liftings is established, and their applications are explored for specific operator classes, including quasicontractions. A particular focus is placed on operators that admit left invertible minimal quasi-isometric liftings. These operators are characterized within the framework of $A$-contractions, and the matrix structures of their liftings are analyzed, highlighting parallels with the isometric liftings of contractions.</description>

      <title>$q$-Numerical radius of sectorial matrices and $2 \times 2$ operator matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on several significant bounds of $q$-numerical radius $w_q(A)$ for sectorial matrix $A$ which refine and generalize previously established bounds. One of the significant bounds we have derived is as follows:
  \[\frac{|q|^2\cos^2\alpha}{2} \|A^*A+AA^*\| \le w_q^2(A)\le \frac{\left(\sqrt{(1-|q|^2)\left(1+2sin^2(\alpha)\right)}+ |q|\right)^2}{2} \|A^*A+AA^*\|,\]
  where $ A $ is a sectorial matrix. Also, upper bounds for commutator and anti-commutator matrices and relations between $w_q(A^t)$ and $w_q^t(A)$ for non-integral power $t\in [0,1]$ are also obtained. Moreover, a few significant estimations of $q$-numerical radius of off-diagonal $2\times2$ operator matrices are developed.</description>

      <title>Trace of Multi-variable Matrix Functions and its Application to Function of Graph Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix extension of a scalar function of a single variable is well-studied in literature. Of particular interest is the trace of such functions. It is known that for diagonalizable matrices, $M$, the function $g(M) = \text{Tr}(f(M)) = \sum_{j=1}^n f(\mu_j)$ (where $\{\mu_j\}_{j=1,2,\cdots,n}$ are the eigenvalues of $M$) inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of $f$ ($f$ need not be operator convex for $g$ to be convex -- convexity is sufficient). In this paper we first develop the idea of matrix extension of function of multiple variables, study the monotonicity and convexity properties of the trace, and thus show that a function of form $g(M) = \sum_{j_1=1}^n \sum_{j_2=1}^n \cdots \sum_{j_m=1}^n f(\mu_{j_1}, \mu_{j_2},\cdots, \mu_{j_m})$ also inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of the multi-variable function, $f$. We apply the results to functions of the spectrum of the weighted Laplacian matrix of an undirected, simple graph.</description>

      <title>Hardy operators: In the footsteps of Brown, Halmos, and Shields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the two classical Hardy operators $\mathcal{H}_{1}$ on $L^2(0, 1)$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ on $L^2(0, \infty)$ initially studied by Brown, Halmos and Shields. Particular emphasis is given to the construction of explicit cyclic and $*$-cyclic vectors in conjunction with a characterization of their invariant and reducing subspaces. We also provide a complete description of the frame vectors for $I - \mathcal{H}_{1}^{*}$.</description>

      <title>Functions and operators of the polyharmonic and polyanalytic Clifford fine structures on the $S$-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral theory on the $S$-spectrum originated to give quaternionic quantum mechanics a precise mathematical foundation and as a spectral theory for linear operators in vector analysis.
  This theory has proven to be significantly more general than initially anticipated, naturally extending to fully Clifford operators and revealing unexpected connections with the spectral theory based on the monogenic spectrum, developed over forty years ago by A. McIntosh and collaborators.
  In recent years, we have combined slice hyperholomorphic functions with the Fueter-Sce mapping theorem, also called Fueter-Sce extension theorem, to broaden the class of functions and operators to which the theory can be applied. This generalization has led to the definition of what we call the {\em fine structures on the $S$-spectrum}, consisting of classes of functions that admit an integral representation and their associated functional calculi.
  In this paper, we focus on the fine structures within the Clifford algebra setting, particularly addressing polyharmonic functions, polyanalytic functions, holomorphic Cliffordian functions and their associated functional calculi defined via integral representation formulas.
  Moreover, we demonstrate that the monogenic functional calculus, defined via the monogenic Cauchy formula, and the $F$-functional calculus of the fine structures, defined via the Fueter-Sce mapping theorem in integral form, yield the same operator.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of the R13 Equations Using Tensor-Valued Korn Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we finally catch up with proving the well-posedness of the linearized R13 moment model, which describes, e.g., rarefied gas flows. As an extension of the classical fluid equations, moment models are robust and have been frequently used, yet they are challenging to analyze due to their additional equations. By effectively grouping variables, we identify a 2-by-2 block structure, allowing the analysis of the well-posedness within the abstract LBB framework of saddle point problems. Due to the unique tensorial structure of the equations, in addition to an interesting combination of tools from Stokes' and linear elasticity theory, we also need new coercivity estimates for tensor fields. These Korn-type inequalities are established by analyzing the symbol map of the symmetric and trace-free part of tensor derivative fields. Together with the corresponding right inverse of the tensorial divergence, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Ergodic theorems for set maps under weak forms of additivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate various relaxations of additivity for set maps into Banach spaces in the context of representations of amenable groups. Specifically, we establish conditions under which asymptotically additive and almost additive set maps are equivalent. For Banach lattices, we further show that these notions are related to a third weak form of additivity adapted to the order structure of the space. By utilizing these equivalences and reducing non-additive settings to the additive one by finding suitable additive realizations, we derive new non-additive ergodic theorems for amenable group representations into Banach spaces and streamline proofs of existing results in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Bergman projection induced by radial weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.09837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of when the Bergman projection $P_\omega$ induced by a radial weight $\omega$ on the unit disc is a bounded operator from one space into another is of primordial importance in the theory of Bergman spaces. The long-standing problem of describing the radial weights $\omega$ such that $P_\omega$ is bounded on the Lebesgue space $L^p_\omega$ had been known to experts since decades before it was formally posed by Dostani\'c in 2004. A natural limit case of this setting is when $P_\omega$ acts from $L^\infty$ to the Bloch space. The surjectivity of the operator becomes another relevant question in this limit case.
  The main findings of this study are shortly listed as follows. We establish characterizations of the radial weights $\omega$ on the unit disc such that $P_\omega:L^\infty\to\mathcal{B}$ is bounded and/or acts surjectively, or the dual of $A^1_\omega$ is isomorphic to the Bloch space $\mathcal{B}$ under the $A^2_\omega$-pairing. We also solve the problem posed by Dostani\'c under a weak regularity hypothesis on the weight involved. With regard to Littlewood-Paley estimates, we describe the radial weights $\omega$ such that the norm of any function in $A^p_\omega$ is comparable to the norm in $L^p_\omega$ of its derivative times the distance from the boundary. This last-mentioned result solves another well-known problem on the area. All characterizations can be given in terms of doubling conditions on moments and/or tail integrals $\int_r^1\omega(t)\,dt$ of $\omega$, and are therefore easy to interpret.
  We also make substantial progress about the two weight inequality
  $$
  \|P_\omega(f)\|_{L^p_\nu}\le C\|f\|_{L^p_\nu},\quad f\in L^p_\nu, \quad 1&lt;p&lt;\infty.
  $$ for radial weights $\omega$ and $\nu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Logvinenko-Sereda Theorem for vector valued functions. That is, for an arbitrary Banach space $X$, all $p \in [1,\infty]$, all $\lambda \in (0,\infty)^d$, all $f \in L^p (\mathbb{R}^d ; X)$ with $\operatorname{supp} \mathcal{F} f \in \times_{i=1}^d (-\lambda_i/2 , \lambda_i /2)$, and all thick sets $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ we have \begin{equation*} \lVert \mathbf{1}_E f \rVert_{L^p (\mathbb{R}^d)} \geq C \lVert f \rVert_{L^p (\mathbb{R}^d)} . \end{equation*} The constant is explicitly known in dependence of the geometric parameters of the thick set and the parameter $\lambda$. As an application, we study control theory for normally elliptic operators on Banach spaces whose coefficients of their symbol are given by bounded linear operators. This includes systems of coupled parabolic equations or problems depending on a parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral theory for operator pencils and operator differential-algebraic equations is studied. Special focus is laid on singular operator pencils and three different concepts of singularity of operator pencils are introduced. The concepts are analyzed in detail and examples are presented that illustrate the subtle differences. It is investigated how these concepts are related to uniqueness of the underlying algebraic-differential operator equation, showing that, in general, classical results known from the finite dimensional case of matrix pencils and differential-algebraic equations do not prevail. The results are then studied in the setting of structured operator pencils arising in dissipative differential-algebraic equations. Here, unlike to the general infinite-dimensional case, the uniqueness of solutions to dissipative differential-algebraic operator equations is closely related to the singularity of the pencil.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is about the maximally monotone and quasidense subsets of the product of a real Banach space and its dual. We discuss six subclasses of the maximal monotone sets that are equivalent to the quasidense ones. We define the Gossez extension to the dual of a maximally monotone set, and give seven equivalent characterizations of an element of this set in the quasidense case. We discuss maximally monotone sets of ``type (NI)'' (one of the six classes referred to above) and we show that the ``tail operator'' is not of type (NI), but it is the Gossez extension of a maximally monotone set that is of type (NI). We generalize Rockafellar's surjectivity theorem for maximally monotone subsets of reflexive Banach spaces to maximally monotone subsets of type (NI) of general Banach spaces. We also discuss briefly maximally monotone subsets of ``type (D)'' (another one of the six classes referred to above). In the final section of this paper, we discuss a generalization of the Brezis-Browder theorem on monotone linear subspaces of reflexive spaces to the nonreflexive situation.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of the present paper is to address multiple aspects of the Fuglede question dealing (Fourier spectra vs geometry) with a variety of $L^2$ contexts where we make precise the interplay between the three sides of the question: (i) existence of orthogonal families of Fourier basis functions (and associated spectra) on the one hand, (ii) extensions of partial derivative operators, and (iii) geometry of the corresponding domains, stressing systems of translation-tiles. We emphasize an account of old and new developments since the original 1974-paper by Bent Fuglede where the co-authors and Steen Pedersen have contributed.</description>

      <title>Weighted Shift operators on spaces of analytic functions over an annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article aims to initiate a study of the forward weighted shift operator, denoted by $F_w$, defined on the Banach spaces $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ and $c_{0,a,b}(\mathtt{A})$. Here, $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ and $c_{0,a.b}(\mathtt{A})$, respectively, are the Banach spaces of analytic functions on a suitable annulus $\mathtt{A}$ in the complex plane, having a normalized Schauder basis of the form $\{(a_n+b_nz)z^n, ~~n\in \mathbb{Z}\}$, which is equivalent to the standard basis in $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$ and $c_0(\mathbb{Z})$. We first obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for $F_w$ to be bounded, and show that, under certain conditions on $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$, the operator $F_w$ is similar to a compact perturbation of a bilateral weighted shift on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$. This also allows us to obtain the essential spectrum of $F_w$. Further, we study when $F_w$ and its adjoint $F_w^*$ are hypercyclic, supercyclic, and chaotic, and provide a class of chaotic operators that are compact perturbations of weighted shifts on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$. Finally, it is proved that the adjoint of a shift on the dual of $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ can have non-trivial periodic vectors, without being even hypercyclic. Also, the zero-one law of orbital limit points fails for $F_w^*$.</description>

Abstract: For a fixed analytic function $g$ on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$, we consider the analytic paraproducts induced by $g$, which are defined by $T_gf(z)= \int_0^z f(\zeta)g'(\zeta)\,d\zeta$, $S_gf(z)= \int_0^z f'(\zeta)g(\zeta)\,d\zeta$, and $M_gf(z)= f(z)g(z)$.
  The boundedness of these operators on various spaces of analytic functions on $\mathbb{D}$ is well understood. The original motivation for this work is to understand the boundedness of compositions of two of these operators, for example $T_g^2, \,T_gS_g,\, M_gT_g$, etc. Our methods yield a characterization of the boundedness of a large class of operators contained in the algebra generated by these analytic paraproducts acting on the classical weighted Bergman and Hardy spaces in terms of the symbol $g$. In some cases it turns out that this property is not affected by cancellation, while in others it requires stronger and more subtle restrictions on the oscillation of the symbol $g$ than the case of a single paraproduct.</description>
