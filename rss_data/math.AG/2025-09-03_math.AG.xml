      <title>Strata of Ecological Coexistence via Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lotka--Volterra system from the perspective of computational algebraic geometry, focusing on equilibria that are both feasible and stable. These conditions stratifies the parameter space in $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ with the feasible-stable semialgebraic sets. We encode them on the real Grassmannian ${\rm Gr}_{\mathbb{R}}(n,2n)$ via a parameter matrix representation, and use oriented matroid theory to develop an algorithm, combining Grassmann--Pl{\"u}cker relations with branching under feasibility and stability constraints. This symbolic approach determines whether a given sign pattern in the parameter space $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ admits a consistent extension to Pl{\"u}cker coordinates. As an application, we establish the impossibility of certain interaction networks, showing that the corresponding patterns admit no such extension satisfying feasibility and stability conditions, through an effective implementation. We complement these results using numerical nonlinear algebra with \texttt{HypersurfaceRegions.jl} to decompose the parameter space and detect rare feasible-stable sign patterns.</description>

      <title>Rank three representations of Painleve systems: III. Dolbeault structure, spectral correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a holomorphic symplectic isomorphism between the rank 2 and 3 representations of the Painleve systems in the Dolbeault complex structure, and give explicit descriptions of the corresponding elliptic fibrations. This, combined with the de Rham description given in part II, implies that the corresponding moduli spaces are hyperKaehler isometric to each other.</description>

      <title>Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism for derived Deligne-Mumford stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Hochschild-Konstant-Rosenberg theorem for general derived Deligne-Mumford (DM) stacks, extending the results of Arinkin-C\u{a}ld\u{a}raru-Hablicsek in the smooth, global quotient case although with different methods. To formulate our result, we introduce the notion of orbifold inertia stack of a derived DM stack; this supplies a finely tuned derived enhancement of the classical inertia stack, which does not coincide with the classical truncation of the free loop space. We show that, in characteristic 0, the shifted tangent bundle of the orbifold inertia stack is equivalent to the free loop space. This yields an explicit HKR equivalence between Hochschild homology and differential forms on the orbifold inertia stack, as algebras. We also construct a stacky filtered circle, leading to a filtration on the Hochschild homology of a derived DM stack whose associated graded complex recovers the de Rham theory of its orbifold inertia stack. This provides a generalization of recent work of Moulinos-Robalo-To\"en to the setting of derived DM stacks.</description>

      <title>The Balmer spectrum of Voevodsky motives and pure symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduce invariants of points of the Balmer spectrum of the Voevodsky motivic category whose values are "light Rost cycle submodules" of the module of pure symbols in Milnor's K-theory (mod 2). As an application, we show that isotropic points of the Balmer spectrum are closed. We also introduce the notion of points of a boundary type and show that this class contains isotropic points, but not the etale one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that the 2-isotropy of any projective variety is controlled by a pure symbol in the Milnor's K-theory (mod 2) of the flexible closure of the base field. We also show that such pure symbols control the 2-equivalence of field extensions as well as the numerical equivalence of algebraic cycles (with mod 2 coefficients).</description>

      <title>The Torelli locus and Newton polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript is about abelian varieties that are Jacobians of curves. I started writing it for a lecture series at the Arizona Winter School in 2024 on abelian varieties. A longer more descriptive title might be: The Torelli locus in the moduli space of abelian varieties, with applications to Newton polygons of curves in positive characteristic. To elaborate, this manuscript covers two topics: the first is about the geometry of the Torelli locus; the second is about the arithmetic invariants of abelian varieties that occur for Jacobians of smooth curves in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>A-D-E diagrams, Hodge--Tate hyperplane sections and semisimple quantum cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the semisimplicity of quantum cohomology implies the vanishing of off-diagonal Hodge numbers (Hodge--Tateness). We investigate which hyperplane sections of homogeneous varieties possess either of the two properties. We provide a new efficient criterion for non-semisimplicity of the small quantum cohomology ring of Fano manifolds that depends only on the Fano index and Betti numbers. We construct a bijection between Dynkin diagrams of types A, D or E, and complex Grassmannians with Hodge-Tate smooth hyperplane sections. By applying our criteria and using monodromy action, we completely characterize the semisimplicity of the small quantum cohomology of smooth hyperplane sections in the case of complex Grassmannians, and verify a conjecture of Benedetti and Perrin in the case of (co)adjoint Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Transverse slices and Zariski's multiplicity conjecture for quasihomogeneous surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study finitely determined, quasihomogeneous, corank 1 map germs $f$ from $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^3,0)$. We introduce the notion of the $\mu_{\boldsymbol{m},\boldsymbol{k}}$-minimal transverse slice of $f.$ Since this slice is a plane curve, we provide its (topological) normal form. In the irreducible case, under certain conditions, we prove that the number of characteristic exponents of the curve is upper semicontinuous. Furthermore, we show that every topologically trivial 1-parameter unfolding of $f=(f_1,f_2,f_3)$ (not necessarily with $\mu_{\boldsymbol{m},\boldsymbol{k}}$-minimal transverse slice) is of non-negative degree (i.e., for any additional term $\alpha$ in the deformation of $f_i$, the weighted degree of $\alpha$ is not smaller than the weighted degree of $f_i$). As a consequence, we present a proof of Zariski\' s multiplicity conjecture for families in this setting. Finally, under the $\mu_{\boldsymbol{m},\boldsymbol{k}}$-minimal transverse slice assumption, we show that Ruas\' conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Polynomiality of the Striling coefficients of $c(\mathrm{Pol}^d(\mathbb{C}^n))$ and Fano schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the $d$-dependence of $c(\mathrm{Pol}^d(\mathbb{C}^n))$, the Chern class of the $\mathrm{GL}(n)$-representation of degree $d$ homogeneous polynomials in $n$ complex variables is polynomial. We also study the asymptotics of the polynomial $d$-dependence of this Chern class. We apply these results to solve a conjecture of Manivel on the degree of varieties of hypersurfaces containing linear subspaces. We also prove new formulas for the degree and Euler characteristics of Fano schemes of lines for generic hypersurfaces.
  To prove the polynomial dependence of $c(\mathrm{Pol}^d(\mathbb{C}^n))$ we introduce the notion of Striling coefficients. This can be considered as a generalization of Stirling numbers. We express the Stirling coefficients in terms of specializations of monomial symmetric polynomials so we can deduce their polynomiality and, in certain cases, their asymptotic behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of the techniques related to classification of spherical and more general objects within triangulated categories, and its relationship with algebraic geometry, representation theory and symplectic geometry. The primary focus are the techniques of the authors within the 'finite' algebraic geometry setting in dimensions two and three, and within silting discrete algebras, but other approaches including to more general settings by Bapat-Deopurkar-Licata, Smith-Wemyss, Ishii-Ueda, Keating-Smith and Shimpi are also surveyed, in varying levels of detail. Various explicit examples are provided.</description>

We consider the versal deformations and equisingular deformations of curves with a fixed local intersection number $w$ with the boundary, and prove results on the inclusion relations between ideals describing different deformations. A classification is given of singularities expected to appear in codimension $\leq 3$ in a general family with $w\geq 8$.</description>

      <title>Cremona equivalence and log Kodaira dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two projective varieties are said to be Cremona equivalent if there is a Cremona modification sending one onto the other. In the last decade, Cremona equivalence has been investigated widely, and we now have a complete theory for non-divisorial reduced schemes. The case of irreducible divisors is completely different, and not much is known besides the case of plane curves and a few classes of surfaces. In particular, for plane curves it is a classical result that an irreducible plane curve is Cremona equivalent to a line if and only if its log-Kodaira dimension is negative. This can be interpreted as the log version of Castelnuovo's rationality criterion for surfaces. One expects that a similar result for surfaces in projective space should not be true, as it is false, the generalization in higher dimensions of Castelnuovo's Rationality Theorem. In this paper, the first example of such behaviour is provided, exhibiting a rational surface in the projective space with negative log-Kodaira dimension, which is not Cremona equivalent to a plane. This can be thought of as a sort of log Iskovkikh-Manin, Clemens-Griffith, Artin-Mumford example. Using this example, it is then possible to show that Cremona equivalence to a plane is neither open nor closed among log pairs with negative Kodaira dimension.</description>

      <title>Finite abelian groups acting on rationally connected threefolds II: groups of K3 type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite abelian groups acting on three-dimensional rationally connected varieties. We concentrate on the groups of K3 type, that is, abelian extensions by a cyclic group of groups that faithfully act on a K3 surface. In particular, if a finite abelian group faithfully acts on a threefold preserving a K3 surface (with at worst du Val singularities), then such a group is of K3 type. We prove a classification theorem for the groups of K3 type which can act on three-dimensional rationally connected varieties. We note the relation between certain groups of K3 type and K3 surfaces with higher Picard number.</description>

      <title>CM theory, maximal hyperelliptic curves, and Chebyshev polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies hyperelliptic curves $\cH_d$ corresponding to $y^2=\varphi_d(x)$ over finite fields, with $\varphi_d(x)$ a Chebyshev polynomial. Starting from the case where $d=\ell$ is an odd prime number, new cases $(d,q)$ are presented where $\cH_d$ is maximal over the finite field $\FF_{q^2}$ of cardinality $q^2$. In addition, new conditions ruling out the possibility that $\cH_d/\FF_{q^2}$ is maximal for given $(d,q)$, are presented. The arguments involve a mix of results on slopes of Frobenius, explicit descriptions of abelian subvarieties of the jacobian of $\cH_d$ with complex multiplication,
  and a technique from the theory of $2$-descent on jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. In particular, the method used here to prove maximality in characteristics $p\equiv 1\bmod 4$ for $d\equiv 1\bmod 4$ a prime number, deserves attention, as it differs from earlier maximality arguments for other curves. Using the new results as well as extensive calculations with Magma, we pose some questions. A positive answer would completely classify the pairs $(q,d)$ resulting in maximality.</description>

      <title>Spectral moduli problems for level structures and an integral Jacquet-Langlands dual of Morava E-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an E-infinity ring spectrum R, with motivation from chromatic homotopy theory, we define relative effective Cartier divisors for a spectral Deligne-Mumford stack over Spet(R) and prove that, as a functor from connective R-algebras to topological spaces, it is representable. This enables us to solve various moduli problems of level structures on spectral abelian varieties, overcoming difficulty at primes dividing the level. In particular, we obtain higher-homotopical refinement for finite levels of a Lubin-Tate tower as E-infinity ring spectra, which generalizes Morava, Hopkins, Miller, Goerss, and Lurie's spectral realization of the deformation ring at the ground level. Moreover, passing to the infinite level and then descending along the equivariantly isomorphic Drinfeld tower, we obtain a Jacquet-Langlands dual to the Morava E-theory spectrum, along with homotopy fixed point spectral sequences dual to those studied by Devinatz and Hopkins. These serve as potential tools for computing higher-periodic homotopy types from pro-etale cohomology of p-adic general linear groups.</description>

      <title>The CR Yamabe invariant and constant scalar curvature Sasaki metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to the existence of constant transversal scalar curvature Sasaki structures drawing on ideas and tools from the CR Yamabe problem, establishing a link between the CR Yamabe invariant, the existence of Sasaki structures of constant transversal scalar curvature, and the K-stability of Sasaki manifolds. Assuming that the Sasaki-Reeb cone contains a regular vector field, we show that if the CR Yamabe invariant of a compact Sasaki manifold attains a specific value determined by the geometry of the Reeb cone, then the Sasaki manifold is K-semistable. Under the additional assumption of non-positive average scalar curvature, the CR Yamabe invariant attains this topological value if the manifold admits approximately constant scalar curvature Sasaki structures, and we also show a partial converse. As an application, we provide a new numerical criterion for the K-semistability of polarised compact complex manifolds.</description>

      <title>Permutation twisted cohomology, remixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize Balmer and Gallauer's (permutation) twisted cohomology ring, working towards an alternative deduction of the Balmer spectrum of the derived category of permutation modules for any finite $p$-group. The construction comes equipped with a canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring, which we deduce is injective and an open immersion when the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian. For elementary abelian $p$-groups, the twisted cohomology ring coincides with Balmer and Gallauer's original construction.
  To perform this construction, we utilize endotrivial complexes (i.e. the invertible objects of the derived category of permutation modules) arising (up to a shift) from Bredon homology of representation spheres. This topological structure allows us to construct certain $p$-local isomorphisms, from which we build a refined open cover of the Balmer spectrum indexed by conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$. Under this open cover, every endotrivial complex is isomorphic to a shift of the tensor unit in each localization, thus verifying that all endotrivial complexes are line bundles. When the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian, this open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure.</description>

      <title>An introduction to conifold transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes introduce conifold transitions between complex threefolds with trivial canonical bundle from the differential geometric point of view, and with a particular view towards aspects of mathematical physics and string theory. The lecture notes are aimed at beginning graduate students and non-experts, emphasizing explicit calculations and examples. After a brief introduction in Section 1, we recall some basic facts about Calabi-Yau manifolds in Section 2. Section 3 studies the conifold as a Calabi-Yau manifold with singularities, and introduces the local model for a conifold transition. Section 4 discusses global conifold transitions, and recalls the famous result of Friedman concerning the existence of smoothings for nodal Calabi-Yau threefolds. We give a differential geometric proof of the necessity part of Friedman's theorem. Section 5 discusses Reid's fantasy, and the web of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Section 6 discusses metric aspects of the local conifold transition, constructing explicit asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics on the small resolution and the smoothing. Section 7 discusses the metric aspects of global conifold transitions, with a particular emphasis on the heterotic string.</description>

      <title>A Robust Numerical Method for Solving Trigonometric Equations in Robotic Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust numerical method for solving systems of trigonometric equations commonly encountered in robotic kinematics. Our approach employs polynomial substitution techniques combined with eigenvalue decomposition to handle singular matrices and edge cases effectively. The method demonstrates superior numerical stability compared to traditional approaches and has been implemented as an open-source Python package. For non-singular matrices, we employ Weierstrass substitution to transform the system into a quartic polynomial, ensuring all analytical solutions are found. For singular matrices, we develop specialized geometric constraint methods using SVD analysis. The solver demonstrates machine precision accuracy ($&lt; 10^{-15}$ error) with 100\% success rate on extensive test cases, making it particularly valuable for robotics applications such as inverse kinematics problems.</description>

      <title>The Galois Theory (a ring theoretic approach)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental concepts in the Galois Theory are separable, normal and Galois field extensions. These concepts are central in proofs of the Galois Theory. In the paper, we introduce a new approach, a ring theoretic approach, to the Galois Theory which is based on central simple algebras and none of the above concepts are used or even mentioned. The only concept which is used is `G-extension' (a finite field extension $L/K$ is called a {\em G-extension} if the endomorphism algebra ${\rm End}_K(L)$ is generated by the field $L$ and the automorphism group ${\rm Aut}_{K-{\rm alg}}(L)$). So, G-extensions are the most symmetric field extensions. In this approach, the Galois Correspondences (for subfields and Galois subfields of $L$) are deduced from the Double Centralizer Theorem which is applied to the central simple algebra ${\rm End}_K(L)$ and G-extensions. Since the class of G-extensions {\em coincides} with the class of Galois extensions, all main results of the Galois Theory are obtained from the `corresponding' results for G-extensions. This approach gives a new conceptual (short) proofs of key results of the Galois Theory. It also reveals that the `maximal symmetry' (of field extensions) is the essence of the Galois Theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $\mathfrak{a}$ be an affine scheme and (respectively) a finite-dimensional associative algebra over an algebraically-closed field $\Bbbk$, both equipped with actions by a linearly-reductive linear algebraic group $G$. We describe the simple finite-dimensional modules over the algebra of $G$-equivariant maps $X\to \mathfrak{a}$ in terms of the representation theory of the fixed-point subalgebras $\mathfrak{a}^x:=\mathfrak{a}^{G_x}\le \mathfrak{a}$, $G_x$ being the respective isotropy groups of closed-orbit $k$-points $x\in X$. This answers a question of E. Neher and A. Savage, extending an analogous result for (also linearly-reductive) finite-group actions. Moreover, the full category of finite-dimensional modules admits a direct-sum decomposition indexed by closed orbits.</description>

We prove various injectivity statements and relate precisely certain Brauer groups (more precisely, spectra) to certain $K$-theoretic strict Picard spectra or strict unit spectra. For example, we prove that for fields $F$ of characteristic $\neq p$, $\mathbf{Br}(F)[p^{\infty}] \simeq \mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{pic}}(L_{K(1)}K(F)\otimes \mathbb{S}_{W(\overline{\mathbb F_p})})[p^\infty]$ where $\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{pic}}$ is Carmeli's strict Picard spectrum, and $\mathbf{Br}(F)$ denotes the Brauer space of the field $F$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show an equivalence of categories, over general $p$-adic bases, between finite locally $p^n$-torsion commutative group schemes and $\Int/p^n\Int$-modules in perfect $F$-gauges of Tor amplitude $[-1,0]$ with Hodge-Tate weights $0,1$. By relating fppf cohomology of group schemes and syntomic cohomology of $F$-gauges, we deduce some consequences: These include the representability of relative fppf cohomology of finite flat group schemes under proper smooth maps of $p$-adic formal schemes, as well as a reproof of a purity result of \v{C}esnavi\v{c}ius-Scholze. We also give a general criterion for a classification in terms of objects closely related to Zink's windows over frames and Lau's divided Dieudonn\'e crystals, and we use this to recover several known classifications, and also give some new ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of generalized hypergeometric integrals defined on punctured Riemann surfaces of genus g. These integrals are closely related to g-loop string amplitudes in chiral splitting, where one leaves the loop-momenta, moduli and all but one puncture un-integrated. We study the twisted homology groups associated to these integrals, and determine their intersection numbers. We make use of these homology intersection numbers to write a double-copy formula for the "complex" version of these integrals -- their closed-string analogues. To verify our findings, we develop numerical tools for the evaluation of the integrals in this work. This includes the recently introduced Enriquez kernels -- integration kernels for higher-genus polylogarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a reduced, local ring $R$ and an ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ of positive height, we give a decomposition of the test module, $\tau(\omega_T, t^{-\lambda})$, of the extended Rees algebra, $T =R[\mathfrak{a} t, t^{-1}]$. In particular, the degree zero component of this test module is $\tau(R, \mathfrak{a}^\lambda)$, thereby reducing the computation of test modules for non-principal ideals to the much easier case of principal ideals. Additionally, we apply our decomposition to generalize results on the $F$-rationality of Rees and extended Rees algebras [HWY02a, Conjecture 4.1],[KK21] as well as give simplified proofs of discreteness and rationality of F-jumping numbers, among other applications.</description>

Abstract: In [KU23] were introduced hybrid pipe dreams interpolating between classic and bumpless pipe dreams, each hybridization giving a different formula for double Schubert polynomials. A bijective proof was given (following [GH23]) of the independence of hybridization, but only for nonequivariant Schubert polynomials. In this paper we further generalize to hybrid generic pipe dreams, replacing the bijective proof of hybridization-independence with a Yang-Baxter-based proof that allows one to maintain equivariance. An additional YB-based proof establishes a divided-difference type recurrence for these generic pipe dream polynomials. These polynomials compute something richer than double Schubert polynomials, namely the equivariant classes of the lower-upper varieties introduced in [Knu05]. We give two proofs of this: the easier being a proof that the recurrence relation holds on those classes, the more difficult being a degeneration of the lower-upper variety to a union of quadratic complete intersections (plus, possibly, some embedded components) whose individual classes match those of the generic pipe dreams. One new feature of the generic situation is a definition of the "flux" through an edge of the matrix; the notion of pipe dream itself can then be derived from the equalities among the fluxes.</description>

      <title>Symmetric spaces for groups over involutive algebras and applications to Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symplectic groups and indefinite orthogonal groups over involutive, possibly noncommutative, algebras $(A, \sigma)$. In the case when the algebra $(A, \sigma)$ is Hermitian, or the complexification $(A_{\mathbb{C}}, \sigma_{\mathbb{C}})$ of a Hermitian involutive algebra, one can identify maximal compact subgroups of such groups, and consider their associated Riemannian symmetric space. This new perspective allows for the realization of various geometric models for the symmetric space. We describe explicitly the complexified tangent space for each of the models, as well as the diffeomorphisms between them and their differentials.
  In an application of this theory, we introduce alternative notions of polystable Higgs bundles that can be used for the study of fundamental group representations into symplectic or into indefinite orthogonal groups over Hermitian involutive algebras. We characterize solutions to the relevant harmonicity equations with respect to these new models of the symmetric space. Reductive fundamental group representations then correspond to holomorphic pairs written with regard to these geometric incarnations of the associated symmetric space, thus allowing new insights for their study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$. We prove that for every $k \geq 4$ there exist uniform but non-homogeneous Steiner bundles on $\mathbb{P}^n$ of $k$-type with disconnected splitting type, and we further investigate almost-uniform Steiner bundles. Our approach relies on interpreting Steiner bundles as relative projective Kronecker representations and applying adjoint pairs arising from restriction, inflation, and reflection functors.</description>

      <title>Canonical Forms as Dual Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dual volume representations of canonical forms for positive geometries in projective spaces, expressing their rational canonical functions as Laplace transforms of measures supported on the convex dual of the semialgebraic set. When the measure is non-negative, we term the geometry completely monotone, reflecting the property of its canonical function. We identify a class of positive geometries whose canonical functions admit such dual volume representations, characterized by the algebraic boundary cut out by a hyperbolic polynomial, for which the geometry is a hyperbolicity region. In particular, simplex-like minimal spectrahedra are completely monotone, with representing measures related to the Wishart distribution, capturing volumes of spectrahedra or their boundaries. We explicitly compute these measures for positive geometries in the projective plane bounded by lines and conics or by a nodal cubic, revealing periods evaluating to transcendental functions. This dual volume perspective reinterprets positive geometries by replacing logarithmic differential forms with probability measures on the dual, forging new connections to partial differential equations, hyperbolicity, convexity, positivity, algebraic statistics, and convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Sparsity and Cohomological Obstructions in Weighted Projective Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the distribution of rational and algebraic points of bounded weighted height in weighted projective spaces over number fields. For a weighted projective space with weights q over a number field k of degree m, we derive an asymptotic formula for the count of such points, featuring a leading term D times X raised to m e Q, plus an error term, where e is the extension degree and Q is the sum of the weights. The constant D combines geometric aspects of the weights with an arithmetic obstruction given by the reciprocal of the gcd of the least common multiple of the weights and Euler's totient of m e. This obstruction stems from the non-surjectivity of the natural morphism from the weighted space to ordinary projective space on rational points, linked to nontrivial torsors under groups of roots of unity. We provide a cohomological interpretation, analogous to the Brauer-Manin obstruction. These findings refine a weighted version of the Batyrev-Manin conjecture and open avenues for applications in moduli theory and arithmetic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use tropicalization to study the duals to cones of nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares on a semialgebraic set $S$. The truncated cones of moments of measures supported on the set $S$ is dual to nonnegative polynomials on $S$, while "pseudo-moments" are dual to sums of squares approximations to nonnegative polynomials. We provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of tropicalizations of the moment and pseudo-moment cones, and demonstrate their usefulness in distinguishing between nonnegative polynomials and sums of squares. We give examples that show new limitations of sums of squares approximations of nonnegative polynomials. When the semialgebraic set is defined by binomial inequalites, its moment and pseudo-moment cones are closed under Hadamard product. In this case, their tropicalizations are polyhedral cones that encode all binomial inequalities on the moment and pseudo-moment cones.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a normal projective variety admitting a polarized endomorphism $f$, i.e., $f^*H\sim qH$ for some ample divisor $H$ and integer $q&gt;1$. It was conjectured by Broustet and Gongyo that $X$ is of Calabi-Yau type, i.e., $(X,\Delta)$ is lc for some effective $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor such that $K_X+\Delta\sim_{\mathbb{Q}} 0$. In this paper, we establish a general guideline based on the equivariant minimal model program and the canonical bundle formula. In this way, we prove the conjecture when $X$ is a smooth projective threefold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a Seshadri stratification on an embedded projective variety provides a flat degeneration of the variety to a union of projective toric varieties, called a semi-toric variety. Such a stratification is said to be normal when each irreducible component of the semi-toric variety is a normal toric variety. In this case, we show that a Gr\"obner basis of the defining ideal of the semi-toric variety can be lifted to define the embedded projective variety. Applications to Koszul and Gorenstein properties are discussed. Relations between LS-algebras and certain Seshadri stratifications are studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14711v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probability that a zero of a random real polynomial of increasing degree is real tends to zero. However, passing from polynomials to Laurent polynomials yields a surprising result: the probability that a root is real tends not to zero, but to $1/\sqrt{3}$. A similar phenomenon has also been observed for systems of Laurent polynomials in several variables. By considering Laurent polynomials as functions associated with torus representations, we describe an analogous phenomenon for representations of any reductive linear group. In the case of a simple group, we provide a formula for the aforementioned limiting probability.</description>

Abstract: In recent work, for a triangulated category $\cT$, the author introduced a topological space $\tSpec(\cT)$ which we call the triangular spectrum of $\cT$ as a tensor-free analog of the Balmer spectrum for a tensor triangulated category. In this paper, we use the triangular spectrum to reconstruct a noetherian scheme $X$ from its perfect derived category $\dpf(X)$. As an application, we give an alternative proof of the Bondal-Orlov-Ballard reconstruction theorem in the special case (when both varieties have ample or anti-ample canonical bundles). Moreover, we define the structure sheaf on $\tSpec(\cT)$ and compare the triangular spectrum and the Balmer spectrum as ringed spaces.</description>

This was suggested in a survey paper by M.Micha{\l}ek. We discuss how this polynomial encodes properties of the matroid by looking at special evaluations. We further introduce an equivariant generalization of the reduced characteristic polynomial of a matroid.</description>

Abstract: We define and study Jacobians of Hodge structures with weight greater than 1. Jacobians of weight 2 naturally come up in the context of the Brauer group and the Tate conjecture. They were previously studied in a special case by Beauville in his work on surfaces of maximal Picard number, and are related to the work of Totaro on Hodge structures with no middle pieces. Higher-weight Jacobians are complex tori, and it is generally quite difficult to tell if they are algebraic. After discussing some general theory, we compute numerous examples of Jacobians of various weights for special classes of varieties: abelian varieties of maximal Picard number, Kummer varieties, and singular K3 surfaces. It turns out that all of these Jacobians are algebraic. We compute their fields of definition.</description>

      <title>On the Hodge and V-filtrations of mixed Hodge modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a Beilinson-type formula for the V-filtration of Kashiwara and Malgrange on a complex mixed Hodge module, using Hodge filtrations on the localization. Our formula expresses the V-filtration as the filtered D-module underlying a pro-mixed Hodge module.
  We apply this to the theory of higher multiplier and Hodge ideals. Our first result shows that higher multiplier ideals can be obtained directly from Hodge ideals by taking a suitable limit. As a corollary, we deduce that Hodge ideals are left semi-continuous if and only if they coincide with higher multiplier ideals, thereby improving results of Saito and Musta\c{t}\u{a}-Popa and resolving a folklore question. We further prove a birational transformation formula for higher multiplier ideals, generalizing the classical formula for multiplier ideals and answering a question of Schnell and the second author. Finally, we provide very quick proofs of the main vanishing theorems for higher multiplier and Hodge ideals, and strengthen a result of B. Chen.</description>

Abstract: Given a complex reductive group $G$ and a $G$-representation $\mathbf{N}$, there is an associated Coulomb branch algebra $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima. In this paper, we provide a new interpretation of $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ as the largest subcomodule of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian on which shift operators (and their deformations induced by flavour symmetries) admit non-equivariant limits. The proofs of the main theorems involve showing that the defining equations of the Coulomb branch algebras reflect the properness of moduli spaces required for defining shift operators.
  As a main application, we give a very general definition of shift operators, and show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $f \colon X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH^\bullet_G(X)$ defines a family of closed Lagrangians in the Coulomb branch $\mathrm{Spec}\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}$, yielding a transformation of 3d branes in 3d mirror symmetry.
  We further apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing formula for Coulomb branches and to derive new generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathsf{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ and Noether-Lefschetz theory of $\mathcal{A}_g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the genus 1 Gromov-Witten theory of the Hilbert scheme $\mathsf{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ of points in the plane. The fundamental 1-point invariant (with a divisor insertion) is calculated using a correspondence with the families local curve Gromov-Witten theory over the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}$. The answer exactly matches a parallel calculation related to the Noether-Lefschetz geometry of the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$ of principally polarized abelian varieties. As a consequence, we prove that the associated cycle classes satisfy a homomorphism property for the projection operator on $\mathsf{CH}^*(\mathcal{A}_g)$. The fundamental 1-point invariant determines the full genus 1 Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathsf{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ modulo a nondegeneracy conjecture about the quantum cohomology. A table of calculations is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Schur classes of ample vector bundles on smooth projective varieties satisfy Hodge-Riemann relations on $H^{p,q}$ under the assumption that $H^{p-2,q-2}$ vanishes. More generally, we study Hodge-Riemann polynomials, which are partially symmetric polynomials that produce cohomology classes satisfying the Hodge-Riemann property when evaluated at Chern roots of ample vector bundles. In the case of line bundles and in bidegree $(1,1)$, these are precisely the nonzero dually Lorentzian polynomials. We prove various properties of Hodge-Riemann polynomials, confirming predictions and answering questions of Ross and Toma. As an application, we show that the derivative sequence of any product of Schur polynomials is Schur log-concave, confirming conjectures of Ross and Wu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in any sequence of a general type MMP, the minimal log discrepancy of singularities takes at most finitely many values, and the fibers of all the extremal contractions and flips belong to a bounded family. A key ingredient in the proof is an analysis of the behavior of local volumes in the MMP.</description>

Abstract: We show that for flat morphisms between varieties with rational singularities, the higher direct images of the structure sheaf are locally free. As a consequence, the identity component of the relative Picard scheme is a smooth algebraic group scheme. v.2. Bhatt pointed out that Lemma 9 was incorrect; it is now replaced. The main theorem is unchanged.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a recent conjecture of the fourth named author with P. Norbury that states a system of universal polynomial relations among the kappa classes on the moduli spaces of algebraic curves. The proof involves localization and materialization analysis of the spin Gromov-Witten theory of the projective line and is dictated by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant topological recursion.</description>

      <title>Bumpless pipe dreams encode Gr\"obner geometry of Schubert polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.08370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their study of infinite flag varieties, Lam, Lee, and Shimozono (2021) introduced bumpless pipe dreams in a new combinatorial formula for double Schubert polynomials. These polynomials are the TxT-equivariant cohomology classes of matrix Schubert varieties and of their flat degenerations. We give diagonal term orders with respect to which bumpless pipe dreams index the irreducible components of diagonal Gr\"obner degenerations of matrix Schubert varieties, counted with scheme-theoretic multiplicity.
  This indexing was conjectured by Hamaker, Pechenik, and Weigandt (2022). This result establishes that bumpless pipe dreams are dual to and as geometrically natural as classical pipe dreams, for which an analogous anti-diagonal theory was developed by Knutson and Miller (2005).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric trees and metric tree arrangements index cones in the polyhedral fan structure in the Dressian $Dr(2,n)$ and $Dr(3,n)$ respectively. We introduce the notion of generalized metric tree arrangements which parameterize points in $Dr(k,n)$ and extend previously known results to $Dr(k,n)$ along with providing explicit examples of these generalized metric tree arrangements. We study the adjacency of cones in the positive Dressian $Dr_{&gt;0}(3, n)$ and introduce generalized Whitehead moves which provide a condition for adjacency of maximal cones in $Dr_{&gt;0}(3,n)$ in terms of the associated metric tree arrangements.</description>

      <title>Topological recursion on transalgebraic spectral curves and Atlantes Hurwitz numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a spectral curve with exponential singularities (which we call a "transalgebraic spectral curve"), we extend the definition of topological recursion to include contributions from the exponential singularities in a way that is compatible with limits of sequences of spectral curves. This allows us to prove the topological recursion/quantum curve correspondence for a large class of transalgebraic spectral curves. As an application, we find that Atlantes Hurwitz numbers, which were previously thought to fall outside the scope of topological recursion, satisfy (our extended version of) topological recursion, and we construct the corresponding quantum curve directly from topological recursion.</description>

Abstract: We provide a quiver description for Cherkis bow varieties in arbitrary type. We explain how this generalizes the construction of Nakajima quiver varieties. We give criteria for stability, non-emptiness, smoothness and discuss deformations. In the appendix, we discuss the relation between the quiver description and the original Cherkis' construction of bow varieties.</description>

      <title>Strength is bounded linearly by Birch rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a homogeneous polynomial over a field. For many fields, including number fields and function fields, we prove that the strength of $f$ is bounded above by a constant multiple of the Birch rank of $f.$ The constant depends only on the degree of $f$ and the absolute transcendence degree of the field. This is the first linear bound obtained for forms of degree greater than three, partially resolving a conjecture of Adiprasito, Kazhdan and Ziegler.
  Our result has applications for the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. The circle method yields an asymptotic formula for counting integral zeros of (collections of) homogeneous polynomials, provided the Birch rank is sufficiently large -- a natural geometric condition. Our main theorem implies that these formulas hold even if we only assume a similar lower bound on the strength of the (collection of) homogeneous polynomials -- an arithmetic condition which is a priori weaker. This answers questions of Cook-Magyar and Skinner, and also yields a new proof of a seminal result of Schmidt as a consequence of Birch's earlier work.
  Over finite fields we obtain a quasi-linear bound for partition rank of tensors in terms of analytic rank, improving Moshkovitz-Zhu's state of the art bound.</description>

      <title>Tropicalizing Principal Minors of Positive Definite Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the tropicalization of the image of the cone of positive definite matrices under the principal minors map. It is a polyhedral subset of the set of $M$-concave functions on the discrete $n$-dimensional cube. We show it coincides with the intersection of the affine tropical flag variety with the submodular cone. In particular, any cell in the regular subdivision of the cube induced by a point in this tropicalization can be subdivided into base polytopes of realizable matroids. We use this tropicalization as a guide to discover new algebraic inequalities among the principal minors of positive semidefinite matrices of a fixed size. We also extend our results to positive semidefinite matrices via taking closures in the tropical semifield $\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}$.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of directed-cycle and catenary linear compartment models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parameter of a mathematical model is structurally identifiable if it can be determined from noiseless experimental data. Here, we examine the identifiability properties of two important classes of linear compartmental models: directed-cycle models and catenary models (models for which the underlying graph is a directed cycle or a bidirected path, respectively). Our main result is a complete characterization of the directed-cycle models for which every parameter is (generically locally) identifiable. Additionally, for catenary models, we give a formula for their input-output equations. Such equations are used to analyze identifiability, so we expect our formula to support future analyses into the identifiability of catenary models. Our proofs rely on prior results on input-output equations, and we also use techniques from linear algebra and graph theory.</description>

      <title>Self-composition of Frobenius a real number of times, and some conjectures around Weil's Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety defined on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On $X$ there is a special morphism $Fr_X$, which raises coordinates to exponent $q$: $t\mapsto t^q$. The two main results in this paper are:
  Result 1: If Standard conjecture D holds on $X\times X$, then all polarised endomorphisms on $X$ are semisimple.
  Result 2: Being an endomorphism of $X$, we can compose $Fr_X$ a \textbf{positive integer} of times, for example $Fr_X^2=Fr_X\circ Fr_X$, $Fr_X^3=Fr_X\circ Fr_X\circ Fr_X$. On the cohomological level, we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all integers $s$. What if we can define $(Fr_X^*)^s$ for all \textbf{real numbers} $s$, in a good way (to be made precise later)? This short note presents an approach towards so-called Dynamical degree comparison conjecture and Norm comparison conjecture (allowing to bound the growth of the pullback of iterations of an endomorphism on cohomology groups in terms of that on algebraic cycles), for dominant rational maps and more generally dynamical correspondences, proposed previously by Fei Hu and the author, via such a possibility. The main upshot is a heuristic argument to show that the mentioned conjectures should follow from Standard conjecture D. All this discussion also holds if we replace $Fr_X$ by another polarised endomorphism on $X$.</description>
