      <title>New X-ray Supernova Remnants in NGC 7793</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the detection of X-ray Supernova Remnants (SNRs) in the galaxy NGC 7793 and the study of their properties. X-ray SNRs in galaxies beyond the Local Group are rare, mainly due to the limited sensitivity of current X-ray instruments. Additionally, their identification requires an optical counterpart, making incomplete optical identification methods an extra challenge. Detecting X-ray SNRs in other galaxies is crucial for understanding their feedback in different evolutionary phases and gaining insights into their local interstellar medium. In NGC 7793, only one X-ray SNR was previously known, while a recent study reported nearly 240 optical SNRs. The discovery of a new, larger optical SNR sample motivated a re-examination of the X-ray SNR population by comparing optical SNRs with X-ray sources. To identify X-ray SNRs, we utilised Chandra's spatial resolution and analysed all available archival data of NGC 7793, totaling 229.9 ks over 19 years. After data reduction, we performed source detection and analysis, searching for X-ray sources coinciding with optical SNRs. We also used XMM-Newton for spectral analysis of the confirmed and candidate SNRs. We detected 58 X-ray sources down to an observed luminosity of $\sim 1.5\times 10^{36}\, erg\, s^{-1}$. Among them, five X-ray counterparts to optical SNRs were identified, all presenting soft emission (&lt;1.2 keV) with no short- or long-term variability. One corresponds to the previously known X-ray SNR, while four are newly detected. Spectral modeling of two SNRs shows thermal spectra exceeding 2.5 million K, with strong OVII, OVIII, and NeIX emission lines. A correlation between density, X-ray luminosity, and source softness was observed. We also report X-ray emission from supernova 2008bk, refining its position, and suggest two candidate X-ray SNRs with soft, non-variable spectra, one resembling the identified X-ray SNRs.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit misalignment and residual eccentricity are evidence that neutron star-black hole mergers form through triple star evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing evidence that a substantial fraction of the neutron star-black holes (NSBHs) detected through gravitational waves merge with non-zero eccentricity or large BH spin-orbit misalignment. This is in tension with the leading formation scenarios to date. Residual eccentricity rules out formation through isolated binary star evolution, while NS natal kicks and the unequal masses of NSBHs inhibit efficient pairing in dense stellar environments. Here, we report that all observed properties-NSBH merger rate, eccentricity, and spin-orbit misalignment-are explained by the high prevalence of massive stellar triples in the field. Modelling their evolution from the ZAMS, we investigate NSBH mergers caused by gravitational perturbations from a tertiary companion. We show that the formation of the NS decisively impacts the triple stability, preferentially leaving behind surviving NSBHs in compact triple architectures. The rich three-body dynamics of compact, unequal-mass triples enables mergers across a wide range of orbital parameters without requiring fine-tuned highly inclined tertiary orbits and provides a natural explanation for an abundance of residual eccentricity and spin-orbit misalignment. We infer a total NSBH merger rate of $R\sim1-23\,\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}$, with more than a few 10% exhibiting eccentricity $e_{20}&gt;0.1$ or large spin-orbit misalignment $\cos\theta_{\rm BH}&lt;0$, consistent with current observations. Tertiary-driven NSBH mergers closely track the cosmic star formation rate due to their short delay times, include a substantial fraction of burst-like highly eccentric systems ($e_{20} &gt; 0.9$), and almost universally retain eccentricities $e_{20}&gt;10^{-3}$, potentially detectable by next-generation detectors. If evidence for eccentric and misaligned events solidifies, our results suggest that triple dynamics is the dominant formation channel of NSBH mergers.</description>

      <title>Speed-dependent Threshold for Electron Injection into Diffusive Shock Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the injection threshold for diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of electrons in collisionless shocks has been a longstanding unsolved problem. Using first-principles kinetic simulations, we identify the conditions for electron injection into DSA and quantify the evolution of the nonthermal tail in self-generated electromagnetic turbulence. By analyzing electron trajectories and their momentum gain during shock-recrossing cycles, we demonstrate that electrons start participating in DSA when their speed is large enough to overrun the shock. We develop a minimal model showing that speed-dependent injection reproduces nonthermal electron spectra observed in kinetic simulations. Our findings establish a new criterion for electron DSA, which has broad implications for the nonthermal emission of shock-powered space/astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Can repeating and non-repeating FRBs be drawn from the same population?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do all Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources repeat? We present evidence that FRB sources follow a Zipf-like distribution, in which the number density of sources is approximately inversely proportional to their burst rate above a fixed energy threshold-even though both the burst rate and number density span many orders of magnitude individually. We introduce a model-independent framework that predicts the distribution of observed fluences and distances, and repetition rates of an FRB population based on an assumed burst rate distribution per source. Using parameters derived directly from observations, this framework simultaneously explains several key features of the FRB population: (i) The observed ratio of repeaters to apparent non-repeaters; (ii) The much lower ratio of apparent non-repeaters to the total number of Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) sources within the observable Universe; And (iii) the slightly smaller average distances of known repeaters compared to non-repeaters. We further explore how survey parameters, such as radio sensitivity and observation time, influence these statistics. Notably, we find that the fraction of repeaters rises only mildly with improved sensitivity or longer exposure. This weak dependence could be misinterpreted as evidence that not all FRBs repeat. Overall, our results support the idea that a single population-likely magnetars-can account for the full observed diversity of FRB activity, from very inactive FRB sources like SGR 1935+2154 to the most active repeaters.</description>

      <title>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Inferring the pair-instability mass gap from gravitational wave data using flexible models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian inference with non-parametric Gaussian process models to investigate the effective inspiral spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, as a function of primary black hole mass in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3). Our analysis reveals a transition in the population at a primary mass of $46^{+7}_{-5}\,M_\odot$. Beyond this mass, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution broadens, becomes consistent with being symmetric around zero, and has a median of $-0.03^{+0.36}_{-0.59}$ (90\% credibility). These results are consistent with the presence of a pair-instability mass gap that is repopulated by black holes that are the remnant of a previous merger, formed in dense star clusters. However, asymmetric distributions skewed toward positive $\chi_{\rm eff}$ are not excluded by current data. Below the inferred transition mass, we constrain the fraction of second-generation black holes to be $\lesssim 10\%$. These results provide model-independent support for a high-mass and high-spin population of black holes in the data, consistent with earlier work using parametric models. Imminent gravitational-wave data releases will be essential to sharpen constraints on spin symmetry and clarify the origin of the black holes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic signatures from pulsar remnants of binary neutron star mergers: prospects for unique identification using multi-wavelength signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can result in the formation of long-lived magnetar remnants which can enhance neutrino and electromagnetic (EM) emissions. In this work, we study the resulting multi-wavelength EM emissions and the prospects of their detectability in the current and upcoming EM telescopes. We model the pulsar-wind neubla system where the long-lived pulsar with dipolar magnetic fields of $10^{13} - 10^{15}$ G (magnetar) spins down and is surrounded by an outward expanding nebula and kilonova ejecta. Although at early times post the merger, the EM signatures are unobservable due to heavy attenuation, they become observable on timescales of $\mathcal{O}(1 - 10)$ days after the merger. We find that the survey and follow-up observations have horizon distances $\gtrsim 1\ \rm Gpc$ for most of the wavebands and conclude that the detection prospects for such long-lived remnants in the electromagnetic channel are promising. This is of crucial importance for multi-messenger observations from BNS mergers to constrain the physical parameters of the remnants. Furthermore, we highlight how observations across the electromagnetic band can uniquely identify magnetar-powered transients resulting from BNS mergers and establish concrete associations of the detected gravitational wave signatures with such transients.</description>

      <title>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM. I. Kinematic and ionization structure of the highly ionized outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our study of the XRISM observation of the Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3783. For the first time, XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter enables a detailed characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along with their ionization parameter $\xi$ and column density $N_{\rm H}$. The high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum uncover six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow absorption lines, with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). This component carries a kinetic luminosity of 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically broader than those of lower ionization species, indicating that the turbulent velocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases with $\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\rm H}$ of the outflows generally declines with $\xi$ up to $\log \xi = 3.2$, but rises beyond this point, suggesting a complex ionization structure. Examination of the absorption profile of the Fe XXV resonance line reveals intriguing similarities to UV absorption lines (Ly$\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a 'hybrid wind' scenario, in which the outflows have multiple origins and driving mechanisms. We explore various interpretations of our findings within AGN wind models.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Burial in Millisecond Magnetars and Late GRB Afterglow Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond magnetars, one of the potential candidates for the central engine of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), can experience significant magnetic field enhancement shortly after their formation. In some cases, this evolution is further influenced by the accretion of stellar debris, which modifies the dipole magnetic field strength. During a hypercritical accretion phase that lasts seconds or longer after the progenitor explosion, a thin crust may form, submerging the magnetic field (the so-called magnetic burial scenario). Once hypercritical accretion ceases, the buried field can diffuse back through the crust, delaying the external dipole's reactivation. On the other hand, observations have shown that relativistic outflows ejected by these objects and decelerated by the circumburst environment cause a late and temporary emission known as afterglow. This work investigates how the submergence and subsequent reemergence of the magnetar magnetic field, on a few years timescales, affect the GRB afterglow dynamics. Specifically, we apply this phenomenological scenario to the late-time X-ray excess observed approximately three years post-burst in GW170817/GRB 170817A, exploring how the evolving magnetic field strength may contribute to this emission. Our modelling of GRB 170817A indicates that $\gtrsim90$ percent of the external dipole flux was initially buried, re-emerging on a timescale $\tau_{B}=3-40$ yr and restoring a surface field $B\simeq(2-5)\times10^{15}\,$G; the late-time X-ray brightening is far better reproduced by this scenario than by models without burial.</description>

      <title>X-ray linear polarization prediction in Black-Hole binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei and its measurements by IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the formation of X-ray linear polarization in black hole (BH) source. The X-ray linear polarization originates from up-scatterings of initially soft photons within a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) characterized by a flat geometry. The IXPE observations of several BHs X-ray binaries and of one Seyfert-1 galaxy confirm our theoretical prediction regarding values of the linear polarization P. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the main physical parameters of these Galactic and extragalactic sources can be derived without any free parameter using the polarization and X-ray spectral measurements. We estimate the CC optical depth, {\tau}0 for all BHs observed by IXPE, using the plot of P vs {\mu} = cos i, where i is an observer inclination with respect to the normal, and considering the values P for a given source. Using X ray spectral analysis, we obtain the photon index {\Gamma} and, analytically determined the CC plasma temperature kBTe. Different BHs (Cyg X 1, 4U 1630 47, LMC X 1, 4U 1957+115, Swift J1727.8 1613, GX 339 4) and the Seyfert 1 NGC 4151 exhibited polarization between 1 and 8 percent level nearly independently of energy. kBTe is in the range between 5 and 90 keV with a smaller value in High/Soft State with respect to Low/Hard State. We find a similarity between the physical parameter and the IXPE findings and we provide evidence suggesting that the CC exhibits a flat geometry.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dual Periodic Signatures in PKS 0805-07 from Multi-technique Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the identification of two statistically significant quasi-periodic oscillations in the weekly binned $\gamma$-ray light curve of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0805$-$07, observed by Fermi-LAT over the period MJD 59047.5-59740.5. By applying a suite of complementary time-series analysis techniques, we identify periodic signatures at approximately 255 and 112 days. These techniques include the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), REDFIT, Date-Compensated Discrete Fourier Transform (DCDFT), Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM), and the String-length method. The reliability of these signals is supported by high local significance (&gt; 99) in all methods and reinforced through phase-folding. Model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly supports a two-component periodic model. The detection of dual QPOs is rare among blazars and suggests complex variability mechanisms. Although a binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) scenario could be considered given the sources high redshift (z = 1.837), the short periodicities are difficult to reconcile with orbital motion unless invoking extreme parameters. Double-sine model fitting reveals that the oscillatory components have comparable amplitudes but are out of phase, suggesting a potential beating phenomenon due to interference. This amplitude-modulated variability is consistent with a geometric origin, most plausibly jet precession driven by Lense-Thirring torques, superimposed with a secondary process such as polar jet oscillation. Doppler factor modulation arising from these effects can account for the observed flux variations without requiring an unrealistically compact binary.</description>

      <title>The intermediate-mass black hole 2XMM J123103.2+110648: a varying disc accretion rate during possible X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fit the evolving X-ray spectra of the variable and fading source 2XMM J123103.2+110648 (J1231), which is an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate. Recent X-ray timing studies have proposed that J1231's quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) observed at the peak of its X-ray lightcurve is a variant of the quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) observed in other sources. Here, we fit X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton, Swift, and Chandra using a slim disc model for the black hole's accretion disc, obtaining a best-fit black hole mass of ($6\pm3)\times10^{4}$ $M_\odot$ and spin of $&gt;0.6$ at 2$\sigma$ confidence. This mass is consistent with past estimates, supporting the IMBH interpretation, and the spin measurement is new. Yet the nature of J1231 remains uncertain: its long-term variability (decade-long continuum evolution) could signal a tidal disruption event or active galactic nuclear variability. We find that the spectral evolution within the first three years after the source's detection can be well explained by either a varying disc accretion rate $\dot m$ or a varying disc inclination $\theta$. Meanwhile, we find that during the short-term variability (the QPO with a ~3.8hr period), each oscillation does not show the "hard-rise-soft-decay" typical of QPEs. We fit the average spectrum at the QPO lightcurve maxima and the average spectrum at its minima, finding that the spectral difference is well explained by $\dot m$ decreasing from peaks to valleys if $\theta&lt;30^{\circ}$ and constant between all data epochs. This result suggests that the short-term QPO behaviour might also be driven by a varying disc $\dot m$.</description>

      <title>Average Power-Density Spectrum of short and long Fermi-GBM Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful electromagnetic outbursts in the Universe and emit a vast amount of their energy in the form of gamma rays. Their duration is extremely short on cosmic timescales, but they show a wealth of time variability in their light curves. Properties of this variability may carry information about the processes the gamma rays emerge from, which are still poorly understood. This research investigates the redshift-corrected gamma-ray light curves of 159 long GRBs, observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope between 2008 and 2023. We calculate the average power-density spectrum (PDS) of different groups of GRBs that are distinguished based on fluence, peak rate, duration, redshift, and the different GRB phases. Almost all redshift-corrected spectra reveal a power-law behavior with high-frequency power-law indices distributed around $\sim -1.9$. The precursor phase and redshift-corrected short bursts exhibit a shallower power law with index $\sim -1.3$, potentially due to the limited statistics that these samples represent. Only in some cases, the high-frequency index is still consistent with the $-5/3$ (Kolmogorov) slope, found by earlier studies and linked to the appearance of fully developed turbulence.</description>

      <title>Searching for sub-TeV IceCube neutrinos correlated to sub-threshold GW events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is active in multi-messenger follow-ups of Gravitational Wave (GW) events. Since the release of the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogue (GWTC)-2.1 by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, sub-threshold GW candidates have been made publicly available. However, they were not followed up in real-time to search for neutrino counterparts. For a deeper understanding of these sub-threshold candidates, archival searches are essential. Finding evidence for a neutrino counterpart will enhance the astrophysical significance of these sub-threshold GW candidates and improve their localisation. Additionally, it will aid in better understanding possible thresholds on specific GW parameters, beyond which the sub-threshold GW candidates could also be promising multi-messenger sources. Thus, the search contributes to the ongoing efforts to establish correlations between astrophysical neutrinos and GW sources. Here, we present the current status of this ongoing work with the IceCube neutrino data.</description>

      <title>AMUSE-Antlia. II. Intracluster X-ray Population in the Antlia Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic survey of X-ray sources in the inner ($r\sim200$ kpc) region of the Antlia cluster based on \Chandra observations, down to a source detection limit of $ L(0.5\text{--}8\ \mathrm{keV})\sim4.2\times10^{-7}\ \mathrm{ph\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ ($2\times10^{38}\ \mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$). We present an X-ray source catalog with 202 sources and provide their coordinates, multi-band flux information and hardness ratios. We find a statistically significant excess at a significance level of $4.2\sigma$ with 37.6 excess sources beyond three times the mean effective radius of the two BCGs. This implies that these excess sources could be a genuine intracluster X-ray population that is not associated with the bulk stellar component. Also, the increased number of excess sources in the fields containing a BCG implies a potential connection between the excess sources and BCGs. The discovery of these sources in the Antlia cluster, together with previous research of similar findings in other two nearby clusters, Virgo and Fornax, indicates that the intracluster X-ray population could be universal in nearby galaxy clusters. Furthermore, we discuss the candidate origins of the excess sources, including low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with intracluster light (ICL-LMXBs), LMXBs in globular clusters (GC-LMXBs) and supernova-kicked LMXBs (SN-kicked LMXBs). We estimate the contribution of ICL-LMXBs, which should include the LMXBs relating with the stellar halo surrounding BCGs, are unlikely to dominate the intracluster X-ray population in Antlia. Meanwhile, GC-LMXBs and SN-kicked LMXBs, each component could contribute $\sim30\%$ to the total excess sources.</description>

      <title>Enhancing air-shower observations: Results from an IceCube Surface Array Prototype Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Surface Array Enhancement of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is set to equip the existing surface cosmic-ray array of ice-Cherenkov detectors, IceTop, with radio antennas and scintillation detectors. This can lower the energy threshold of detection and increase the measurement accuracy of IceTop. The antenna readout uses a multiplicity trigger from the scintillation detectors. A fully functioning prototype station of the enhancement was deployed at the South Pole in 2020 and upgraded in 2023, and provides a pathway for the future IceCube-Gen2 surface array detector. Previous results include air-shower searches with existing data using traditional and machine learning methods and a preliminary estimation of $X_\mathrm{max}$. The detection methods for radio involving multi-detector components are described and the latest results are presented.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric Cooling of Neutron Stars with Strong Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cooling evolution of neutron stars with strong poloidal magnetic fields (with strength not far from observed values) using the full general relativity 2-dimensional \textit{Astreus} code, which solves consistently Einstein's and Maxwell's equations. We find that central magnetic fields with strengths $3-4\times10^{17}$ G, corresponding to surface magnetic fields $7-8\times10^{16}$, can significantly modify the cooling behavior of neutron stars, leading to stars with similar masses but different magnetic fields to exhibit different thermal evolution. We show a non-linear increase in the thermal relaxation time with increasing magnetic fields and that this behavior is associated with the reduction of the Direct Urca process in stars with strong magnetic fields. This is a novel result in which we can observe the magnetic field influence on the thermal evolution of stars, even if it is not strong enough to affect the Fermi distribution of particles.</description>

      <title>The Fast and the Frame-Dragging: Efficient waveforms for asymmetric-mass eccentric equatorial inspirals into rapidly-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational-wave signals emitted by compact binary inspirals provide unique insights into their properties, but their analysis requires accurate and efficient waveform models. Intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 10^2$, are promising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is challenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to millions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses this need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly compute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes. In this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black holes with spin magnitudes $|a| \leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities $e &lt; 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p &lt; 200$, enabling the generation of long-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\sim 100$ ms with hardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our model attains mismatches of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect to error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that kludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as $^{+60\%}_{-40\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\sim 1\sigma$ in parameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies significantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs) with only minor $(\sim10\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20. For signals with SNR $\sim 50$, spin and eccentricity-at-plunge are measured with uncertainties of $\delta a \sim 10^{-7}$ and $\delta e_f \sim 10^{-5}$. This work advances the state-of-the-art in waveform generation for asymmetric-mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>The ATLAS Virtual Research Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Virtual Research Assistant (VRA) of the ATLAS sky survey which performs preliminary eyeballing on our clean transient data stream. The VRA uses Histogram Based Gradient Boosted Decision Tree Classifiers trained on real data to score incoming alerts on two axes: "Real" and "Galactic". The alerts are then ranked using a geometric distance such that the most "Real" and "Extra-galactic" receive high scores; the scores are updated when new light curve data is obtained on subsequent visits. To assess the quality of the training we use the Recall at rank K, which is more informative to our science goal than general metrics such as accuracy or F1-Scores. We also establish benchmarks for our metric based on the pre-VRA eyeballing strategy, to ensure our models provide notable improvements before being added to the ATLAS pipeline. Finally, policies are defined on the ranked list to select the most promising alerts for humans to eyeball and to automatically remove the bogus alerts. In production the VRA method has resulted in a reduction in eyeballing workload by 85% with a loss of follow-up opportunity &lt;0.08%. It also allows us to automatically trigger follow-up observations with the Lesedi telescope, paving the way to automated methods that will be required in the era of LSST.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts Inferred from the CHIME/FRB Baseband Catalog 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of $-1.94^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. $31^{+31}_{-21}$% of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of $1.94^{+1.54}_{-1.31}$ Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at $&gt; 2\sigma$ confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. The furthest FRB detection with planned radio facilities is expected to be at $z \approx 5$. A radio telescope operating at 200 MHz with a system-equivalent flux density of $\leq 0.07$ Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 1 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of $\gtrsim 400$ square degrees should be able to detect $630^{+730}_{-485}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z \gtrsim 6$ and $53^{+83}_{-43}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z\gtrsim 8$, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy signal of UHECRs from a structured magnetized Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surprising isotropy of the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) sky makes it difficult to identify their sources. Observables such as energy spectrum, mass composition and arrival directions are affected by interactions with background photon fields and by deflection in the extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields (EGMF and GMF). In this work, we simulate the propagation of UHECRs with energy above 8 EeV in magnetized replicas of the local Universe, obtained from constrained simulations of the Large Scale Structure. We obtain the real magnetic deflection in structured EGMF models with realistic three-dimensional simulations. We investigate different scenarios for the UHECR source distributions and densities. The effect of the GMF can be different depending on the field model considered. In this work we consider the JF12 model by mapping the arrival directions at the edge of the galaxy to those at Earth. We study the arrival direction distribution of the propagated UHECRs, and in particular their angular power spectrum, dipole and quadrupole moments. We find that the properties of the source distribution affect the cosmic ray anisotropy more than the EGMF model considered. In particular, the low multipole components depend on both the source distribution and the density. We also find that it is difficult to simultaneously reproduce the observed dipole and quadrupole values above EeV. In general, we predict too large a quadrupole strength, incompatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining the redshift of PG 1553+113 using the photohadronic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Between 2005 and 2015, the BL Lacertae object PG 1553+113 exhibited multiple very high-energy (VHE; &gt; 100 GeV) gamma-ray flares, which were detected by the Cherenkov telescopes, High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS), Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC), and the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). Despite the uncertainty surrounding its redshift (z), various studies have sought to estimate this value. In this study, seventeen independently observed VHE gamma-ray spectra of PG 1553+113 are analyzed using four distinct extragalactic background light (EBL) models alongside the photohadronic framework. A global $\chi^2$ fit is applied to all observational data to determine the best-fitting redshift for each EBL model. Additionally, confidence level (CL) intervals for the redshift are calculated across all EBL models. The findings demonstrate that the photohadronic framework effectively describes all observed spectra. Among the EBL models, the lowest total $\chi^2$ value of 58.82 (with 58 degrees of freedom) was obtained using the model from Saldana-Lopez et al. (2021), while the highest value of 75.67 was associated with the model from Dominguez et al. (2011). The 95 per cent CL intervals for the statistical error of the redshift of PG 1553+113 are 0.500 &lt; z &lt; 0.537 for the Saldana-Lopez et al. (2021) model and 0.491 &lt; z &lt; 0.527 for the Dominguez et al. (2011) model. These results highlight the consistency of the photohadronic approach in interpreting the observed VHE gamma-ray spectra.</description>

      <title>A generalized method to measure the Lorentz factor from gamma-ray burst photospheric emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are inferred from observations depend on the value of the bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$. Consequently, accurately estimating it is an important aim. In this work, we present a method of measuring $\Gamma$ based on observed photospheric emission, which can also be used for highly dissipative flows that may lead to non-thermal spectral shapes. For the method to be applicable, two conditions need to be met: the photon number should be conserved in the later stages of the jet, and the original photon temperature must be inferred from the data. The case of dissipation via subphotospheric shocks is discussed in detail, and we show that the method is particularly efficient when a low-energy spectral break is identified. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by applying it to two different GRB spectra. From one of the spectra, we obtain a value for $\Gamma$ with statistical uncertainties of only $\sim 15$\%, while for the other spectrum we only obtain an upper limit.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Shock X-ray Emission in Novae from Turbulent Mixing with Cool Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shock interaction in classical novae occurs when a fast outflow from the white dwarf &gt; 1000 km s/s collides with a slower, cooler shell of gas released earlier in the outburst. The shocks radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio synchrotron to GeV gamma-rays. The hot shocked gas also emits &gt;~ keV thermal X-rays, typically peaking weeks after the eruption, once the ejecta becomes transparent to photoelectric absorption. However, the observed hard X-ray luminosities are typically &gt;4 orders of magnitude smaller than would be naively expected given the powerful shocks implied by the gamma-rays. We argue that a key missing piece to this puzzle is turbulence behind the shock, driven, e.g., by thin-shell and/or thermal instabilities. Turbulence efficiently mixes the hot X-ray emitting gas with cooler gas, sapping the hot gas of energy faster than it can directly radiate. Using analytic arguments motivated by numerical simulations, we show that energy losses due to turbulent mixing can easily balance shock heating, greatly reducing the volume of the hot gas and suppressing the X-ray luminosity. Equating the characteristic thickness of the X-ray emitting region to the minimum outer length scale of the turbulence capable of cooling the hot gas through mixing, we obtain X-ray luminosities consistent with nova observations if only ~1% of the shock's kinetic power goes into turbulent motions. A similar process may act to suppress thermal X-rays from other shock powered transients, such as interacting supernovae.</description>

Abstract: The structure and stability of quark stars (QSs) made of interacting quark matter are discussed in this study, taking color superconductivity and perturbative QCD corrections into account. By combining this EoS with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, we explore the mass-radius ($M-R$) relations of QSs. The analysis is conducted within the framework of $R^2$ gravity, where the gravity model is described by $f(R) = R + a R^2$. Our primary goal is to investigate how variations in the $R^2$ gravity parameter $a$ affect the mass-radius and mass-central density ($M-\rho_c$) relationships of QSs. Furthermore, we study the dynamical stability of these stars by analyzing the impact of anisotropy parameters $\beta$ and the interaction parameter $\lambda$ derived from the EoS, on their stability. Our results demonstrate that the presence of pressure anisotropy plays a significant role in increasing the maximum mass of QSs, with potential implications for the existence of super-massive pulsars. These findings are in agreement with recent astronomical observations, which suggest the possibility of neutron stars exceeding $2M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in X-rays: Revised XMM-Newton Limits and New Constraints from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of dark matter (DM) candidates, sub-GeV particles and primordial black holes (PBHs), that can inject low-energy electrons and positrons into the Milky Way and leave observable signatures in the X-ray sky. In the case of sub-GeV DM, annihilation or decay into $e^+e^-$ contributes to the diffuse sea of cosmic-ray (CR) leptons, which can generate bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (IC) emission on Galactic photon fields, producing a broad spectrum from X-rays to $\gamma$-rays detectable by instruments such as eROSITA and XMM-Newton. For PBHs with masses below $\sim10^{17}$ g, Hawking evaporation similarly yields low-energy $e^\pm$, leading to comparable diffuse emission. Using the first data release from eROSITA and incorporating up-to-date CR propagation and diffusion parameters, we derive new constraints on both scenarios. For sub-GeV DM, we exclude thermally averaged annihilation cross sections in the range $\sim 10^{-27}-10^{-25} \ \mathrm{cm^3/s}$ and decay lifetimes of $\sim 10^{24}-10^{25}$ s for masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, with eROSITA outperforming previous X-ray constraints below $\sim$ 30 MeV. For asteroid-mass PBHs, we set new bounds on the DM fraction based on their Hawking-induced emission. Finally, we revisit earlier constraints from XMM-Newton, finding that they were approximately four orders of magnitude too stringent due to the use of the instrument's geometric solid angle rather than its exposure-weighted solid angle. Upon using the exposure-weighted solid angle, we show that the revised XMM-Newton limits are slightly weaker than those from eROSITA.</description>
