      <title>Charged-Current Elastic Scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the measurement of the charged-current elastic scattering process $e^-p\rightarrow\nu_e n$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This process provides sensitivity to the poorly constrained axial form factor of the nucleon, which encodes the spatial distribution of weak charge. Collisions of electrons with polarized protons enable measuring the axial form factor via the $e^{-\!}\,\vec{p} \to \nu_e\,n$ target-spin asymmetry for the first time. We conclude that a measurement of charged-current elastic scattering at the EIC will prove very challenging.</description>

      <title>Roper Resonance Structure and Exploration of Emergent Hadron Mass from CLAS Electroproduction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $N(1440)1/2^+$ nucleon resonance, first identified in 1964 by L.D. Roper and collaborators in analyses of $\pi N$ hadroproduction data have continued to provide pivotal insights that serve to advance our understanding of nucleon excited states. In this contribution, we present results from studies of the structure of the Roper resonance based on exclusive $\pi N$ and $\pi^+\pi^-p$ electroproduction data measured with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab. These analyses have revealed the Roper resonance as a complex interplay between an inner core of three dressed quarks and an external meson--baryon cloud. Analyses of the CLAS results on the evolution of the Roper resonance electroexcitation amplitudes with photon virtuality $Q^2$, within the framework of the Continuum Schwinger Method, have conclusively demonstrated the capability to gain insight into the strong interaction dynamics responsible for generating more than 98\% of hadron mass. Further extension of such studies to higher $Q^2$--through experiments currently underway with the CLAS12 detector and in the future with a potential CEBAF energy upgrade to 22 GeV--offers the only foreseeable opportunity to explore the full range of distances where the dominant portion of hadron mass and resonance structure emerges.</description>

      <title>Production of High-Specific-Activity Radioisotopes Using High-Energy Fusion Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that transmutation driven by high-energy neutrons from deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion can produce many medically important radioisotopes-including $^{99}$Mo/${}^{99\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Tc}$, $^{131}$I, $^{177}$Lu, $^{153}$Sm, $^{111}$In, $^{133}$Xe, $^{32}$P, $^{64}$Cu, $^{60}$Co, $^{103}$Pd, $^{89}$Sr, $^{188}$Re, $^{117}$In/$^{117\mathrm{m}1}$Sn, $^{90}$Y, and $^{166}$Ho - and emerging isotopes such as $^{161}$Tb, $^{195\mathrm{m}1}$Ir/$^{195\mathrm{m}}$Pt, $^{47}$Sc, ${}^{103}\mathrm{Ru}/{}^{103\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Rh}$, ${}^{103}\mathrm{Pd}/{}^{103\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Rh}$, and $^{119}$Sb with high specific activity and in large quantities. These reactions involve stable, abundant feedstocks and non-fission transmutation channels that change the proton number, enabling chemical rather than isotopic separation. Fusion-based transmutation could provide a flexible and proliferation-resistant platform for supply of high-purity isotopes. A D-T neutron source operating at a few megawatts of fusion power could meet or exceed global demand for most major radioisotopes. Further research is required to develop tailored approaches for feedstock processing and product extraction.</description>

      <title>Search for Double Beta Plus Decays with NuDoubt++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double beta plus decay is a rare nuclear disintegration process. Difficulties in its measurement arise from suppressed decay probabilities, experimentally challenging decay signatures and low natural abundances of suitable candidate nuclei. In this presentation, we propose NuDoubt++, a new detector concept to overcome these challenges. It is based on the first-time combination of hybrid and opaque scintillation detector technology paired with novel light read-out techniques. This approach is particularly suitable detecting positron (beta plus) signatures. We expect to discover two-neutrino double beta plus decay modes within 1 tonne-week exposure and are able to probe neutrinoless double beta plus decays at several orders of magnitude improved significance compared to current experimental limits.</description>

      <title>Incoherent Particle Production in Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first complete treatment of incoherent photon-initiated production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions, focussing on the dilepton and diphoton final states. In the former case we compare to the ATLAS measurement of dielectron production and find that our predictions match the data very well. In the latter case we show that this contribution is too small to explain the observed broad in diphoton acoplanarity background to the purely coherent light-by-light scattering signal. We in addition consider a new `quark emission' topology, which while naively might be expected to dominate the incoherent diphoton production channel, is in fact found to be kinematically suppressed. Finally, we revisit QCD-initiated diphoton production and issue of theoretical uncertainties in this case. We find that this again cannot explain the observed size of the higher acoplanarity background. The production mechanism leading to this background to light-by-light production, and the reason for its observed enhancement in comparison to the dilepton case, therefore remains unclear.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the three-kaon interaction and its relation with $K(1460)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the hypothesis of $K(1460)$ being a hadronic $J^P=0^-$ molecule through nonperturbative $S$-wave $K K\bar K$, $K\pi\pi$, $K\pi\eta$ coupled-channel dynamics in a three-body unitary isobar approach. The scalar two-body coupled-channel resonances $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$, $a_0(980)$ and $K^*_0(700)$ are generated in the subsytems in amplitudes that match phase shifts from experiment. In a first step, previous results in the limit of mass-degenerate, stable $f_0$ and $a_0$ isobars are reproduced. Once the full seven-coupled channel model is switched on, other $S$-matrix effects obscure and modify the resonance signal, including complex thresholds, a two-body cusp, and a triangle singularity at threshold.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Iterative Deblurring: No Explicit Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Iterative deblurring, notably the Richardson-Lucy algorithm with and without regularization, is analyzed in the context of nuclear and high-energy physics applications. In these applications, probability distributions may be discretized into a few bins, measurement statistics can be high, and instrument performance can be well understood. In such circumstances, it is essential to understand the deblurring first without any explicit noise considerations. We employ singular value decomposition for the blurring matrix in a low-count pixel system. A strong blurring may yield a null space for the blurring matrix. Yet, a nonnegativity constraint for images built into the deblurring may help restore null-space content in a high-contrast image with zero or low intensity for a sufficient number of pixels. For low-contrast images, control over null-space content can be achieved through regularization. When regularization is applied, the blurred image is, in practice, restored to one that is still blurred but less than the starting image.</description>

      <title>Investigating event-shape methods in the search for the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the measured anisotropy $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method fulfills the general premise of measuring the CME but is statistically hungry. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background-contributing sources, because of statistical fluctuations of intertwining variables used in the method, and is thus not practically useful or clean to measure the CME.</description>

      <title>Statistical research on determining sensitivity of neutrinoless double beta decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of experimental sensitivity is a key step in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$), providing a quantitative benchmark for detector design. Two commonly used statistical approaches are the counting method, which estimates sensitivity from the number of events in a predefined region of interest, and the fitting method, which extracts the signal contribution by fitting the full energy spectrum. In this work, we investigate both discovery sensitivity and exclusion sensitivity within these two approaches. Through statistical derivation and simulation verification, we show that the relative performance of the methods depends on both energy resolution and exposure, while at higher exposures the fitting method consistently yields more stringent sensitivity. These results provide guidance for selecting the optimal statistical method in future $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments.</description>
