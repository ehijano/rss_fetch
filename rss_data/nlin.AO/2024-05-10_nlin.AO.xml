      <title>Dynamical properties of a small heterogeneous chain network of neurons in discrete time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonlinear bidirectionally coupled heterogeneous chain network whose dynamics evolve in discrete time. The backbone of the model is a pair of popular map-based neuron models, the Chialvo and the Rulkov maps. This model is assumed to proximate the intricate dynamical properties of neurons in the widely complex nervous system. The model is first realized via various nonlinear analysis techniques: fixed point analysis, phase portraits, Jacobian matrix, and bifurcation diagrams. We observe the coexistence of chaotic and period-4 attractors. Various codimension-1 and -2 patterns for example saddle-node, period-doubling, Neimark-Sacker, double Neimark-Sacker, flip- and fold-Neimark Sacker, and 1:1 and 1:2 resonance are also explored. Furthermore, the study employs two synchronization measures to quantify how the oscillators in the network behave in tandem with each other over a long number of iterations. Finally, a time series analysis of the model is performed to investigate its complexity in terms of sample entropy.</description>

      <title>Topological bifurcations in a mean-field game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field games (MFG) provide a statistical physics inspired modeling framework for decision making in large-populations of strategic, non-cooperative agents. Mathematically, these systems consist of a forward-backward in time system of two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), namely the Fokker-Plank and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, governing the agent state and control distribution, respectively. In this work, we study a finite-time MFG with a rich global bifurcation structure using a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM is a 4D two-point boundary value problem obtained by restricting the controlled dynamics to first two moments of the agent state distribution, i.e., the mean and the variance. Phase space analysis of the ROM reveals that the invariant manifolds of periodic orbits around the so-called `ergodic MFG equilibrium' play a crucial role in determining the bifurcation diagram, and impart a topological signature to various solution branches. We show a qualitative agreement of these results with numerical solutions of the full-order MFG PDE system.</description>

      <title>Adaptability and Homeostasis in the Game of Life interacting with the evolved Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of homeostasis in a two-layer system of the Game of Life, in which the Game of Life in the first layer couples with another system of cellular automata in the second layer. Homeostasis is defined here as a space-time dynamic that regulates the number of cells in state-1 in the Game of Life layer. A genetic algorithm is used to evolve the rules of the second layer to control the pattern of the Game of Life. We discovered that there are two antagonistic attractors that control the numbers of cells in state-1 in the first layer. The homeostasis sustained by these attractors are compared with the homeostatic dynamics observed in Daisy World.</description>
