      <title>On the Hodge and V-filtrations of mixed Hodge modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove a filtered version of Beilinson-type formula for the V-filtration of Kashiwara and Malgrange for any D-module underlying a complex mixed Hodge module along a hypersurface, using Hodge filtrations on the localization.
  We give some applications to the theory of higher multiplier and Hodge ideals. The main result is that the higher multiplier ideals can be deduced directly from the Hodge ideals by taking a suitable limit. As a corollary, we conclude that the Hodge ideals are left semi-continuous if and only if they coincide with the higher multiplier ideals.
  In an appendix, we make some general observations about Hodge and higher multiplier ideals. We observe that results of Saito and Chen-Musta\c{t}\u{a} give a birational formula for higher multiplier ideals, answering a question of Schnell and the second author, and that the Kodaira vanishing theorem for twisted Hodge modules gives a short proof of the vanishing theorem for Hodge ideals, strengthening a result of B. Chen.</description>

      <title>Some contributions of Edoardo Ballico to Moduli spaces and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a contribution to the Special Volume in Celebration of the 70th Birthday of Edoardo Ballico.
  First, I describe how some results of Ballico on moduli of vector bundles and categories coherent sheaves were useful for solving problems in a variety of areas: Homological Mirror Symmetry, symplectic geometry, Hodge theory, mathematical physics, noncommutative geometry.
  Second, I summarise some strong results of Ballico about the number of components of moduli scheme of sheaves and about the existence of singularities on moduli of vector bundles.
  Third, the text includes a section written by Wojciech Kucharz, about the work of Ballico on moduli flexibility of real manifolds.</description>

      <title>Weak admissibility of exponentially twisted cohomology associated with some nondegenerate functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the filtered $\Phi$-modules canonically attached to the exponentially twisted cohomology associated with some nondegenerate functions. Inspired by $p$-adic Hodge theory, we conjecture that those filtered $\Phi$-modules are weakly admissible. We show that this expectation is correct under some assumptions using the theory of Adolphson and Sperber.</description>

      <title>A note on elliptic curves on toric surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Severi varieties parametrizing integral curves of geometric genus one on polarized toric surfaces in characteristic zero and describe their irreducible components. We show that the irreducible components are in natural bijection with certain affine sublattices of the lattice of characters of the toric surface. The sublattices are described explicitly in terms of the polygon defining the polarization of the toric surface.</description>

      <title>Weighted Heights and GIT Heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between GIT heights and weighted heights, exploring their definitions and applications to weighted projective spaces and binary forms. Drawing on prior weighted height frameworks, we relate them to Zhang's GIT height via the Veronese map, showing that for a semistable cycle Z in a weighted projective space over the algebraic closure of Q, the GIT height h(Z) equals L(Z) plus an Archimedean Chow metric term. For binary forms f in V_d, we define an invariant height H(f) with respect to the Chow metric and establish that the moduli weighted height L(xi(f)) of f's invariants equals H(f) plus the field degree times the Chow height h_Ch(f), linking arithmetic and moduli properties.</description>

      <title>On the Milnor fibres of initial forms of topologically equivalent holomorphic functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Budur, Fernandes de Bobadilla, Le and Nguyen (2022) conjectured that if two germs of holomorphic functions are topologically equivalent, then the Milnor fibres of their initial forms are homotopy equivalent. In this note, we give affirmative answers to this conjecture in the case of plane curves. We show also that a positive answer to this conjecture implies in a positive answer to the famous Zariski multiplicity conjecture both in the case of right equivalence or in the case of hypersurfaces with isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>Real subrank of order-three tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the subrank of real order-three tensors and give an upper bound to the subrank of a real tensor given its complex subrank. Using similar arguments to those used by Bernardi-Blekherman-Ottaviani, we show that all subranks between the minimal typical subrank and the maximal typical subrank, which equals the generic subrank, are also typical. We then study small tensor formats with more than one typical subrank. In particular, we construct a $3 \times 3 \times 5$-tensor with subrank $2$ and show that the subrank of the $4 \times 4 \times 4$-quaternion multiplication tensor is $2$. Finally, we consider the tensor associated to componentwise complex multiplication in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and show that this tensor has real subrank $n$ - informally, no more than $n$ real scalar multiplications can be carried out using a device that does $n$ complex scalar multiplications. We also prove a version of this result for other real division algebras.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi--Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein--Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi--Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi--Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi--Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose--type blow--ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi--Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow--up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi--Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge--Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi--Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>On defect in finite extensions of valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, the defect of finite extensions of valued fields has emerged as the main obstacle in several fundamental problems in algebraic geometry such as the local uniformization problem. Hence, it is important to identify defectless fields and study properties related to defect. In this paper we study the relations between the following properties of valued fields: simply defectless, immediate-defectless and algebraically maximal. The main result of the paper is an example of an algebraically maximal field that admits a simple defect extension. For this, we introduce the notion of quasi-finite elements in the generalized power series field $k\left(\left(t^\Gamma\right)\right)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02759v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class of polynomials whose Hessians evaluated at any point of a closed convex cone have Lorentzian signature. This class is a generalization to the remarkable class of Lorentzian polynomials. We prove that hyperbolic polynomials and conic stable polynomials belong to this class, and the set of polynomials with Lorentzian signature is closed. Finally, we develop a method for computing permanents of nonsingular matrices which belong to a class that includes nonsingular $k$-locally singular matrices via hyperbolic programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the spectrum of the quantum (or Dubrovin) connection of smooth projective surfaces under blow-ups. Our main result is that for small values of the parameters, the quantum spectrum of such a surface is asymptotically the union of the quantum spectrum of a minimal model of the surface and a finite number of additional points located "close to infinity", that correspond bijectively to the exceptional divisors. This proves a conjecture of Kontsevich in the surface case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study smooth complex quasi-projective surfaces whose fundamental group is a free product of cyclic groups. In particular, we prove the existence of an admissible map from the quasi-projective surface to a smooth complex quasi-projective curve. Associated with this result, we prove addition-deletion Lemmas for fibers of the admissible map which describe how these operations affect the fundamental group of the quasi-projective surface. Our methods also allow us to produce curves in smooth projective surfaces whose fundamental groups of their complements are free products of cyclic groups, generalizing classical results on $C_{p,q}$ curves and torus type projective sextics, and showing how general this phenomenon is.</description>

      <title>On the topology of fiber-type curves: a Zariski pair of affine nodal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore conditions for a curve in a smooth projective surface to have a free product of cyclic groups as the fundamental group of its complement. It is known that if the surface is $\mathbb P^2$, then such curves must be of fiber type, i.e. a finite union of fibers of an admissible map onto a complex curve. In this setting, we exhibit an infinite family of Zariski pairs of fiber-type curves, that is, pairs of plane projective fiber-type curves whose tubular neighborhoods are homeomorphic, but whose embeddings in $\mathbb P^2$ are not. This includes a Zariski pair of curves in $\mathbb C^2$ with only nodes as singularities (and the same singularities at infinity) whose complements have non-isomorphic fundamental groups, one of them being free. Our examples show that the position of nodes also affects the topology of the embedding of projective curves. Twisted Alexander polynomials with respect to finite $SU(2)$ representations show to be useful for this purpose, since all their abelian invariants are the same for both fundamental groups.</description>

      <title>Absolute calculus and prismatic crystals on cyclotomic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, $W$ the ring of Witt vectors of a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p$ and $\zeta$ a primitive $p$th root of unity. We introduce a new notion of calculus over $W$ that we call absolute calculus. It may be seen as a singular version of the $q$-calculus used in previous work, in the sense that the role of the coordinate is now played by $q$ itself. We show that what we call a weakly nilpotent $\mathbb\Delta$-connection on a finite free module is equivalent to a prismatic vector bundle on $W[\zeta]$. As a corollary of a theorem of Bhatt and Scholze, we finally obtain that a $\mathbb\Delta$-connection with a frobenius structure on a finite free module is equivalent to a lattice in a crystalline representation. We also consider the case of de Rham prismatic crystals as well as Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method for constructing virtual cycles for rank-2 Higgs sheaves $(E,\phi)$ on a smooth projective surface $S$. Using this, we redefine the $\mathbf{SU}(2)$-perfect obstruction theory previously constructed by Tanaka-Thomas. The key step in our construction involves modifying the $\mathbf{C}^\times$-localisation formula of Graber-Pandharipande by replacing the torus action with an involution $(E,\phi) \mapsto (E,-\phi^*)$.</description>

      <title>Approximation of maps from algebraic polyhedra to real algebraic varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a real algebraic variety $Y,$ by a $\mathcal{K}$-regular map $|\mathcal{K}|\rightarrow Y$ we mean a continuous map whose restriction to every simplex in $\mathcal{K}$ is a regular map. A simplified version of our main result says that if $Y$ is a uniformly retract rational variety and if $k, l$ are integers satisfying $0\leq l\leq k,$ then every $\mathcal{C}^l$ map $|\mathcal{K}|\rightarrow Y$ can be approximated in the $\mathcal{C}^l$ topology by $\mathcal{K}$-regular maps of class $\mathcal{C}^k.$ By definition, $Y$ is uniformly retract rational if for every point $y\in Y$ there is a Zariski open neighborhood $V\subset Y$ of $y$ such that the identity map of $V$ is the composite of regular maps $V\rightarrow W\rightarrow V,$ where $W\subset\mathbb{R}^p$ is a Zariski open set for some $p$ depending on $y.$</description>

      <title>Principalization on logarithmically foliated orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In characteristic zero, we construct principalization of ideals on smooth orbifolds endowed with a normal crossings divisor and a foliation. We then illustrate how the method can be used in the general study of foliations via two applications. First, we provide a resolution of singularities of Darboux totally integrable foliations in arbitrary dimensions -- including rational and meromorphic Darboux foliations. Second, we show how to transform a generically transverse section into a transverse section.</description>

      <title>On the module of derivations of a line arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To each multiple point $p$ in a line arrangement $\mathcal A$ in the complex projective plane we associate a derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$. We show first that these derivations span a large subspace of $D_0(\mathcal A)$. To each such derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0(\mathcal A)$ we associate a polynomial $g_p$ which seems to play a key role in the characterization of the freeness of $\mathcal A$, as well as in the study of the position of the multiple points of $\mathcal A$ with respect to unions of lines.</description>

      <title>Partially Hyperbolic Compact Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and investigate two types, the latter with two variants, of notions of partial hyperbolicity accounting for several classes of compact complex manifolds behaving hyperbolically in certain directions, defined by a vector subbundle of the holomorphic tangent bundle, but not necessarily in the other directions. A key role is played by certain entire holomorphic maps, possibly from a higher-dimensional space, into the given manifold $X$. The dimension of the origin $\C^p$ of these maps is allowed to be arbitrary, unlike both the classical $1$-dimensional case of entire curves and the $1$-codimensional case introduced in previous work of the second-named author with S. Marouani. The higher-dimensional generality necessitates the imposition of certain growth conditions, very different from those in Nevanlinna theory and those in works by de Th\'elin, Burns and Sibony on Ahlfors currents, on the entire holomorphic maps $f:\C^p\longrightarrow X$. The way to finding these growth conditions is revealed by certain special, possibly non-K\"ahler, Hermitian metrics in the spirit of Gromov's K\"ahler hyperbolicity theory but in a higher-dimensional context. We then study several classes of examples, prove implications among our partial hyperbolicity notions, give a sufficient criterion for the existence of an Ahlfors current and a sufficient criterion for partial hyperbolicity in terms of the signs of two curvature-like objects introduced recently by the second-named author.</description>

      <title>Sesquilinear pairings on elliptic curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by a ring $R$, where $R$ is an order in an imaginary quadratic field or quaternion algebra. We define sesquilinear pairings ($R$-linear in one variable and $R$-conjugate linear in the other), taking values in an $R$-module, generalizing the Weil and Tate-Lichtenbaum pairings.</description>

      <title>Reductions of GKZ Systems and Applications to Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful approach to computing Feynman integrals or cosmological correlators is to consider them as solution to systems of differential equations. Often these can be chosen to be Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) systems. However, their naive construction introduces a significant amount of unnecessary complexity. In this paper we present an algorithm which allows for reducing these GKZ systems to smaller subsystems if a parameter associated to the GKZ systems is resonant. These simpler subsystems can then be solved separately resulting in solutions for the full system. The algorithm makes it possible to check when reductions happen and allows for finding the associated simpler solutions. While originating in the mathematical theory of D-modules analyzed via exact sequences of Euler-Koszul homologies, the algorithm can be used without knowledge of this framework. We motivate the need for such reduction techniques by considering cosmological correlators on an FRW space-time and solve the tree-level single-exchange correlator in this way. It turns out that this integral exemplifies an interesting relation between locality and the reduction of the differential equations.</description>
