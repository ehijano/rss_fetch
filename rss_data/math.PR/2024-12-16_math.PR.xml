      <title>The Critical Beta-splitting Random Tree III: The exchangeable partition representation and the fringe tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the critical beta-splitting model of a random $n$-leaf rooted tree, clades are recursively split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto 1/(i(m-i))$. Study of structure theory and explicit quantitative aspects of the model is an active research topic. It turns out that many results have several different proofs, and detailed studies of analytic proofs are given elsdewhere (via analysis of recursions and via Mellin transforms). This article describes two core probabilistic methods for studying $n \to \infty$ asymptotics of the basic finite-$n$-leaf models.
  (i) There is a canonical embedding into a continuous-time model, that is a random tree CTCS(n) on $n$ leaves with real-valued edge lengths, and this model turns out to be more convenient to study. The family (CTCS(n), $n \ge 2)$ is consistent under a ``delete random leaf and prune" operation. That leads to an explicit inductive construction (the {\em growth algorithm}) of (CTCS(n), $n \ge 2)$ as $n$ increases, and then to a limit structure CTCS$(\infty)$ which can be formalized via exchangeable partitions, in some ways analogous to the Brownian continuum random tree.
  (ii) There is an explicit description of the limit fringe distribution relative to a random leaf, whose graphical representation is essentially the format of the cladogram representation of biological phylogenies.</description>

      <title>Critical threshold for weakly interacting log-correlated focusing Gibbs measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study log-correlated Gibbs measures on the $d$-dimensional torus with weakly interacting focusing quartic potentials whose coupling constants tend to $0$ as we remove regularization. In particular, we exhibit a phase transition for this model by identifying a critical threshold, separating the weakly and strongly coupling regimes; in the weakly coupling regime, we show that the frequency-truncated measures converge to the base Gaussian measure (possibly with a renormalized $L^2$-cutoff), whereas, in the strongly coupling regime, we prove non-convergence of the frequency-truncated measures, even up to a subsequence. Our result answers an open question posed by Brydges and Slade (1996).</description>

      <title>Averaging principles for time-inhomogeneous multi-scale SDEs via nonautonomous Poisson equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish asymptotic behaviors of time-inhomogeneous multi-scale stochastic differential equations (SDEs). To achieve them, we analyze the evolution system of measures for time-inhomogeneous Markov semigroups, and investigate regular properties of nonautonomous Poisson equations. The strong and the weak averaging principle for time-inhomogeneous multi-scale SDEs, as well as explicit convergence rates, are provided. Specifically, we show the slow component in the multi-scale stochastic system converges strongly or weakly to the solution of an averaged equation, whose coefficients retain the dependence of the scaling parameter. When the coefficients of the fast component exhibit additional asymptotic or time-periodic behaviors, we prove the slow component converges strongly or weakly to the solution of an averaged equation, whose coefficients are independent of the scaling parameter. Finally, two examples are given to indicate the effectiveness of all the averaged equations mentioned above.</description>

      <title>On the Markov transformation of Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Gaussian process $(X_t)_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$, we construct a Gaussian \emph{Markov} process with the same one-dimensional marginals using sequences of transformations of $(X_t)_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ "made Markov" at finitely many times. We prove that there exists at least such a Markov transform of $(X_t)_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$. In the case the instantaneous decorrelation rate of $(X_t)_{t \in \mathbb{R}}$ is continuous, we prove that the Markov transform is uniquely determined and characterized through the same instantaneous decorrelation rate.</description>

      <title>Regional Fractional Stochastic Burgers from random interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to derive the crossover from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to energy solutions of the stochastic Burgers equation with characteristic operators given in terms of fractional operators, such as the regional fractional Laplacian. The approach is to consider a boundary driven exclusion process with long jumps and asymmetric jump rates. Depending on the strength of the asymmetry we prove the convergence to stationary solutions of either the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation, or the stochastic Burgers equation. In the later setting, the convergence in some regimes is guaranteed by the recent proof of uniqueness of energy solutions derived in [16].</description>

      <title>The Critical 2d Stochastic Heat Flow and Related Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we review recent progress in the study of the stochastic heat equation and its discrete analogue, the directed polymer model, in spatial dimension 2. It was discovered that a phase transition emerges on an intermediate disorder scale, with Edwards-Wilkinson (Gaussian) fluctuations in the sub-critical regime. In the critical window, a unique scaling limit has been identified and named the critical 2d stochastic heat flow. This gives a meaning to the solution of the stochastic heat equation in the critical dimension 2, which lies beyond existing solution theories for singular SPDEs. We outline the proof ideas, introduce the key ingredients, and discuss related literature on disordered systems and singular SPDEs. A list of open questions is also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the non-trivial function obtained by Ferrari and Liu for the persistence probability of the Airy$_1$ process has a strikingly similar form as a large deviation function found earlier by the author for current fluctuations of the totally asymmetric exclusion process with periodic boundaries conditioned on flat initial and final states. A proposed explanation for this observation, which relates similar yet clearly distinct quantities, is that both results pertain to conditioning on the same kind of rare events where a current larger than typical is maintained throughout the system.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for full space-time splitting discretizations of semi-linear SPDEs -- with a focus on dG domain decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a fully discretized numerical scheme for parabolic stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative noise. Our abstract framework can be applied to formulate a non-iterative domain decomposition approach. Such methods can help to parallelize the code and therefore lead to a more efficient implementation. The domain decomposition is integrated through the Douglas-Rachford splitting scheme, where one split operator acts on one part of the domain. For an efficient space discretization of the underlying equation, we chose the discontinuous Galerkin method as this suits the parallelization strategy well. For this fully discretized scheme, we provide a strong space-time convergence result. We conclude the manuscript with numerical experiments validating our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Learning payoffs while routing in skill-based queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in service systems, we consider queueing systems where each customer must be handled by a server with the right skill set. We focus on optimizing the routing of customers to servers in order to maximize the total payoff of customer--server matches. In addition, customer--server dependent payoff parameters are assumed to be unknown a priori. We construct a machine learning algorithm that adaptively learns the payoff parameters while maximizing the total payoff and prove that it achieves polylogarithmic regret. Moreover, we show that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic terms by deriving a regret lower bound. The algorithm leverages the basic feasible solutions of a static linear program as the action space. The regret analysis overcomes the complex interplay between queueing and learning by analyzing the convergence of the queue length process to its stationary behavior. We also demonstrate the performance of the algorithm numerically, and have included an experiment with time-varying parameters highlighting the potential of the algorithm in non-static environments.</description>

      <title>The Stein-log-Sobolev inequality and the exponential rate of convergence for the continuous Stein variational gradient descent method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stein Variational Gradient Descent method is a variational inference method in statistics that has recently received a lot of attention. The method provides a deterministic approximation of the target distribution, by introducing a nonlocal interaction with a kernel. Despite the significant interest, the exponential rate of convergence for the continuous method has remained an open problem, due to the difficulty of establishing the related so-called Stein-log-Sobolev inequality. Here, we prove that the inequality is satisfied for each space dimension and every kernel whose Fourier transform has a quadratic decay at infinity and is locally bounded away from zero and infinity. Moreover, we construct weak solutions to the related PDE satisfying exponential rate of decay towards the equilibrium. The main novelty in our approach is to interpret the Stein-Fisher information, also called the squared Stein discrepancy, as a duality pairing between $H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, which allows us to employ the Fourier transform. We also provide several examples of kernels for which the Stein-log-Sobolev inequality fails, partially showing the necessity of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of the n-th Degree Bounded Stochastic Dominance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic dominance orders are widely used in risk management and decision-making under uncertainty. We provide a novel characterization of the $n$-th degree bounded stochastic dominance (BSD) order, linking it to the risk tolerance of decision-makers and providing a decision-theoretic foundation for these stochastic orders. Our results reveal two contrasting implications: on the positive side, they clarify how BSD can be tailored to reflect specific risk preferences through the choice of the interval $[a,b]$. On the negative side, they highlight limitations of BSD, including the dependence of BSD on the chosen interval and the peculiar risk aversion behavior of decision-makers included in the generator of BSD. We illustrate our results through a portfolio optimization model with stochastic dominance constraints. Additionally, using our characterization, we present comparative statics results for decision-making under uncertainty with globally bounded risk aversion measures and savings decisions under globally bounded prudence measures, and derive inequalities for $n$-convex functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Gibbs measures associated with Euclidean quantum field theory with polynomial-type of interactions on the torus. We observe the (non-)normalizability of the multivariate version of $P(\Phi)_2$ models by the variational method. Moreover, we extend this setting to the "fractional model" in the "Wick renormalizable regime": the base Gaussian measure has the inverse of the fractional power of the Laplacian as its covariance with the restriction that the Wick products that appear during the renormalization procedure are all well-defined. After working on the issue in a general setting, we also examine some specific examples as an application.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the application of Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization to the construction of random fields within the sublinear expectation framework. Using the semigroup approach and the infinite dimensional $G$-Ornstein Uhlenbeck process, we derive the unique mild solution to the robust Langevin dynamics of bosonic free field -- a parabolic linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by cylindrical $G$-Brownian motions. Mimicking the linear expectation case, we show the equilibrium distribution of the mild solution is the sublinear expectation analog of the massive Gaussian free field.</description>

      <title>Probing the transition from polynomial to exponential complexity in spin glasses via N-particle branching Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) is a Gaussian process indexed by a binary tree of depth $T$, introduced by Derrida and Spohn, then Bovier and Kurkova, as a toy model of a spin glass. Addario-Berry and the second author have established the existence of an algorithmic hardness threshold $x_*$ in the CREM: finding a state of energy lower than $-x T$ is possible in polynomial time if $x &lt; x_*$, and takes exponential time if $x &gt; x_*$, with high probability. In this article, we are interested in the nature of the transition from polynomial to exponential complexity near the algorithmic hardness threshold. We do this by studying in detail the performance of a certain beam-search algorithm of beam width $N = N(T)$ depending on $T$ -- we believe this algorithm to be natural and asymptotically optimal. The algorithm turns out to be essentially equivalent to the time-inhomogeneous version of the so-called $N$-particle branching Brownian motion ($N$-BBM), which has seen a lot of interest in the last two decades. Studying the performance of the algorithm then amounts to investigating the maximal displacement at time $T$ of the time-inhomogeneous $N$-BBM. In doing so, we are able to quantify precisely the nature of the transition from polynomial to exponential complexity, proving that the transition happens when the log-complexity is of the order of $T^{1/3}$. This result appears to be the first of its kind and we believe that this phenomenon should extend to other models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider convergence properties of the long-term behaviors with respect to the coefficient of the stochastic term for a nonautonomous stochastic $p$-Laplacian lattice equation with multiplicative noise. First, the upper semi-continuity of pullback random $(\ell^2,\ell^q)$-attractor is proved for each $q\in[1,+\infty)$. Then, a convergence result of the time-dependent invariant sample Borel probability measures is obtained in $\ell^2$. Next, we show that the invariant sample measures satisfy a stochastic Liouville type equation and a termwise convergence of the stochastic Liouville type equations is verified. Furthermore, each family of the invariant sample measures is turned out to be a sample statistical solution, which hence also fulfills a convergence consequence.</description>

      <title>Risk aggregation and stochastic dominance for a class of heavy-tailed distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of heavy-tailed distributions for which any weighted average of independent and identically distributed random variables is larger than one such random variable in (usual) stochastic order. We show that many commonly used extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) distributions, such as the Pareto, Fr\'echet, and Burr distributions, belong to this class. The established stochastic dominance relation can be further generalized to allow negatively dependent or non-identically distributed random variables. In particular, the weighted average of non-identically distributed random variables dominates their distribution mixtures in stochastic order.</description>

      <title>Uniform in Time Propagation of Chaos for Mean Field Particle System with Interacting Noise and Partially Dissipative Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, uniform in time quantitative propagation of chaos in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for mean field interacting particle system is derived, where the diffusion coefficient is allowed to be interacting and the drift is assumed to be partially dissipative. The main tool relies on reflection coupling, the gradient estimate of the decoupled SDEs, and the Duhamel formula for two semigroups associated to two time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes on $(\R^d)^N$. Moreover, the uniform in time quantitative propagation of chaos in $L^\eta$($\eta\in(0,1)$)-Wasserstein distance is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of tree-type diagrams assembled from oriented chains of edges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of tree-type diagrams that arise in studies of the cumulant expansion in discrete Erd\H os-R\'enyi random matrix models. Using a version of the Pr\" ufer code, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of tree-type diagrams assembled from $k$ oriented chains of $q$ edges. Using this modified Pr\"ufer codification, we get an explicit expression for sum overs weighted tree-type diagrams with a weight depending on multiplicity of edges. We describe similar results for tree-type diagrams assembled from chains that are not necessarily regular.</description>

      <title>Modeling frequency distribution above a priority in presence of IBNR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinsurance, Poisson and Negative binomial distributions are employed for modeling frequency. However, the incomplete data regarding reported incurred claims above a priority level presents challenges in estimation. This paper focuses on frequency estimation using Schnieper's framework for claim numbering. We demonstrate that Schnieper's model is consistent with a Poisson distribution for the total number of claims above a priority at each year of development, providing a robust basis for parameter estimation. Additionally, we explain how to build an alternative assumption based on a Negative binomial distribution, which yields similar results. The study includes a bootstrap procedure to manage uncertainty in parameter estimation and a case study comparing assumptions and evaluating the impact of the bootstrap approach.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations of a self-interacting diffusion on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations in the average speed or current of a self-interacting diffusion (SID) on a ring, mimicking the non-Markovian behaviour of an agent influenced by its own path. We derive the SID's phase diagram, showing a delocalisation-localisation phase transition from self-repelling to self-attracting. Current fluctuations are analysed using: (i) an adiabatic approximation, where the system reaches its stationary distribution before developing current fluctuations, and (ii) an original extension of level 2.5 large deviations for Markov processes combined with perturbation theory. Both methods provide lower bounds to current fluctuations, with the former tighter than the latter in all localised regimes, and both equally tight in the self-repelling region. Both methods accurately estimate the asymptotic variance and suggests a phase transition at the onset of the localised regime.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Reduced Models to Unravel Transitions in Non-equilibrium Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a general framework for capturing noise-driven transitions in spatially extended non-equilibrium systems and explains the emergence of coherent patterns beyond the instability onset. The framework relies on stochastic parameterizations to reduce the original equations' complexity while capturing the key effects of unresolved scales. It works for both Gaussian and Levy-type noise. Our parameterizations offer two key advantages. First, they approximate stochastic invariant manifolds when the latter exist. Second, even when such manifolds break down, our formulas can be adapted by a simple optimization of its constitutive parameters. This allows us to handle scenarios with weak time-scale separation where the system has undergone multiple transitions, resulting in large-amplitude solutions not captured by invariant manifold or other time-scale separation methods. The optimized stochastic parameterizations capture how small-scale noise impacts larger scales through the system's nonlinear interactions. This effect is achieved by the very fabric of our parameterizations incorporating non-Markovian coefficients into the reduced equation. Such coefficients account for the noise's past influence using a finite memory length, selected for optimal performance. The specific "memory" function, which determines how this past influence is weighted, depends on the noise's strength and how it interacts with the system's nonlinearities. Remarkably, training our theory-guided reduced models on a single noise path effectively learns the optimal memory length for out-of-sample predictions, including rare events. This success stems from our "hybrid" approach, which combines analytical understanding with data-driven learning. This combination avoids a key limitation of purely data-driven methods: their struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, also known as the "extrapolation problem."</description>

      <title>Some observations on Erd\H{o}s matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper in 1959, Marcus and Ree proved that every $n\times n$ bistochastic matrix $A$ satisfies $\|A\|_{\operatorname{F}}^2\leq \max_{\sigma\in S_n}A_{i,\sigma(i)}$ where $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $\{1, \ldots, n\}$. Erd\H{o}s asked to characterize the bistochastic matrices for which the equality holds in the Marcus--Ree inequality. We refer to such matrices as Erd\H{o}s matrices. While this problem is trivial in dimension $n=2$, the case of dimension $n=3$ was only resolved recently in~\cite{bouthat2024question} in 2023. We prove that for every $n$, there are only finitely many $n\times n$ Erd\H{o}s matrices. We also give a characterization of Erd\H{o}s matrices that yields an algorithm to generate all Erd\H{o}s matrices in any given dimension. We also prove that Erd\H{o}s matrices can have only rational entries. This answers a question of~\cite{bouthat2024question}.</description>

      <title>Mathematical description of continuous time and space replicator-mutator equations for quadratic fitness landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The replicator-mutator equation is a model for populations of individuals carrying different traits, with a fitness function mediating their ability to replicate, and a stochastic model for mutation. We derive analytical solutions for the replicator-mutator equation in continuous time and for continuous traits for a quadratic fitness function. Using these results we can explain and quantify (without the need for numerical in-silico simulations) a series of evolutionary phenomena, in particular the flying kite effect, survival of the flattest, and the ability of a population to sustain itself while tracking an optimal feature which may be fixed, moving with bounded velocity in trait space, oscillating, or randomly fluctuating.</description>
