      <title>Coarse non-wandering sets and their filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates recurrence properties of dynamical systems under the restriction that control is available only through inputs and outputs. We introduce the concept of ``coarse non-wandering'', a generalization of the classical non-wandering concept, and construct an associated filtration based on levels that quantify the closeness of recurrence behavior under input/output-only control. The forward direction of this filtration describes how the level of control relates to recurrence properties, whereas the backward direction captures the robustness of such behaviors and, in particular, guarantees controllability through control applied only at the observation points when the observational noise is sufficiently small. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existence of a wandering domain is equivalent to the presence of an orbit reachable within finite error but unable to return within any slightly enlarged error bound.</description>

      <title>A simple criterion for identifying slow-fast relaxation oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple conditions have been developed in [Zhang, Wahl and Yu, SIAM Rev. 2014; Yu and Wang, Math. Biosci. Eng. 2019], which are used to identify the existence of slow-fast relaxation oscillations that appear in differential systems, where the geometric singular perturbation theory is not applicable. In this study, we present seven models which fail to satisfy these conditions, yet still show recurrence phenomena, which motivate us to generalize these conditions to establish new simple hypothetical conditions for identifying slow-fast relaxation oscillations and providing arguments towards the development of a mathematical theory.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of strong and weak foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a perturbation $f$ of a hyperbolic toral automorphism $L$. We study rigidity related to exceptional properties of the strong and weak stable foliations for $f$. If the strong foliation is mapped to the linear one by the conjugacy $h$ between $f$ and $L$, we obtain smoothness of $h$ along the weak foliation and regularity of the joint foliation of the strong and unstable foliations. We also establish a similar global result. If the weak foliation is sufficiently regular, we obtain smoothness of the conjugacy along the strong foliation and regularity of the joint foliation of the weak and unstable foliations. If both conditions hold then we get smoothness of $h$ along the stable foliation. We also deduce a rigidity result for the symplectic case. The main theorems are obtained in a unified way using our new result on relation between holonomes and normal forms.</description>

      <title>Topological Entropy of Nonlinear Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two general upper bounds on the topological entropy of nonlinear time-varying systems are established: one using the matrix measure of the system Jacobian, the other using the largest real part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix with off-diagonal entries replaced by their absolute values. A general lower bound is constructed using the trace of the Jacobian matrix. For interconnected systems, an upper bound is first derived by adapting one of the general upper bounds, using the matrix measure of an interconnection matrix function. A new upper bound is then developed using the largest real part of the eigenvalues of this function. This new bound is closely related to the individual upper bounds for subsystems and implies each of the two general upper bounds when the system is viewed as one of two suitable interconnections. These entropy bounds all depend only on upper or lower limits of the Jacobian matrix along trajectories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Perturbing and $C^*$-algebra Lifting Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of a new kind of topological-dynamical stability by investigating when permutations of finite sets within a metric space which are close to being actions by a group can be perturbed to genuine actions. We show these perturbing problems can have solutions in the case of dynamics on the Cantor set, and develop a theoretical framework for potentially producing examples of other perturbing problems with no solution. We also investigate connections with semiprojectivity of $C^*$-algebras. In doing so, we define a notion of conditional semiprojectivity and show that maps of finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebras are conditionally semiprojective, but that the inclusion of $C(S^1)$ into $C(S^1)\rtimes \Gamma$ (for any non-trivial action) is not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for analyzing the relationship between the supports of conditional measures and their geometric arrangement in Wasserstein space via the disintegration map. Our method establishes criteria to determine when such conditional measures arise from a metric measure foliation. Additionally, we provide a concrete example demonstrating how this framework can be applied to study deformations (or perturbations) of disintegration-induced foliations.</description>

      <title>Data Denoising and Derivative Estimation for Data-Driven Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems is often hampered by measurement noise. We propose a denoising framework, called Runge-Kutta and Total Variation Based Implicit Neural Representation (RKTV-INR), that represents the state trajectory with an implicit neural representation (INR) fitted directly to noisy observations. Runge-Kutta integration and total variation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is a trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The trained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation. These denoised states and derivatives are then supplied to Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to recover the governing equations. Experiments demonstrate effective noise suppression, precise derivative estimation, and reliable system identification.</description>

      <title>Matings, holomorphic correspondences, and a Bers slice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two frameworks for mating Kleinian groups with rational maps on the Riemann sphere: the algebraic correspondence framework due to Bullett-Penrose-Lomonaco \cite{BP94,BL20} and the simultaneous uniformization mating framework of \cite{MM23a}. The current paper unifies and generalizes these two frameworks. To achieve this, we extend the mating framework of \cite{MM23a} to genus zero hyperbolic orbifolds with at most one orbifold point of order $\nu \geq 3$ and at most one orbifold point of order two. We give an explicit description of the resulting conformal matings in terms of uniformizing rational maps. Using these rational maps, we construct correspondences that are matings of such hyperbolic orbifold groups (including punctured spheres and Hecke groups) with polynomials in real-symmetric hyperbolic components. We also define an algebraic parameter space of correspondences and construct an analog of a Bers slice of the above orbifolds in this parameter space.</description>

      <title>Lemon limbs of the cubic connectedness locus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a primary limb structure in the connectedness locus of complex cubic polynomials, where the limbs are indexed by the periodic points of the doubling map $t \mapsto 2t \ (\operatorname{mod} {\mathbb Z})$. The main renormalization locus in each limb is parametrized by the product of a pair of (punctured) Mandelbrot sets. This parametrization is the inverse of the straightening map and can be thought of as a tuning operation that manufactures a unique cubic of a given combinatorics from a pair of quadratic hybrid classes.</description>

Abstract: We determine weak asymptotics of counting functions on generic surfaces in a component of a stratum of $k$-differentials when $k$ is prime and genus is greater than $2$. In order to do so, we classify the $GL^+(2,\mathbb{R})$-orbit closure of holonomy covers of components and apply Eskin-Mirzakhani-Mohammadi generalized to translation surfaces. We show that the $GL^+(2,\mathbb{R})$-orbit closure of these holonomy covers is generically a component of a stratum of translation surfaces or a hyperelliptic locus therein.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for a standard Lebesgue space $X$, the strong operator closure of the semigroup generated by conditional expectations on $L^\infty(X)$ contains the group of measure-preserving automorphisms. This is based on a solution to the following puzzle: given $n$ full water tanks, each containing one unit of water, and $n$ empty ones, how much water can be transferred from the full tanks to the empty ones by repeatedly equilibrating the water levels between pairs of tanks?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of codes with overlapping code words, that we call SPO-codes. The SPO-codes are related to the Markov codes that were introduced in: G. Keller, J. Combinatorial Theory 56, (1991),pp.\ 75--83. The process of generating a coded system from a code extends to SPO-codes. We describe a family of intrinsically ergodic synchronized SPO-coded systems that is closed under topological conjugacy. We construct synchronized subshifts with salient structural features by means of SPO-codes. We construct SPO-coded systems that are not semisynchronized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the geodesic flow on a closed rank one manifold of nonpositive curvature. For certain H\"{o}lder continuous potential, there exists a unique equilibrium state by \cite{BCFT}. In this paper, we introduce the notions of core limit set, regular radial limit set and uniformly recurrent and regular vectors, and then construct a family of Patterson-Sullivan measures on the boundary at infinity in two separate settings. Then we give an explicit construction of the above unique equilibrium state using Patterson-Sullivan measures. This enables us to prove the Bernoulli property of the equilibrium states. Using the Patterson-Sullivan construction and mixing properties of equilibrium states, we count the number of free homotopy classes with weights in nonpositive curvature.</description>

      <title>Gap distribution of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ and the circle method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of the properly renormalized gaps of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ with $n &lt; N$ converges (when $N\rightarrow \infty$) to a non-standard limit distribution, as Elkies and McMullen proved in 2004 using techniques from homogeneous dynamics. In this paper we give an essentially self-contained proof based on the circle method. Our main innovation consists in showing that a new type of correlation functions of $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ converge. To define these correlation functions we restrict, smoothly, to those $\sqrt{n} \,\mathrm{mod}\, 1$ that lie in minor arcs, i.e. away from rational numbers with small denominators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important implication of Rademacher's Differentiation Theorem is that every Lipschitz curve $\Gamma$ infinitesimally looks like a line at almost all of its points in the sense that at $\mathcal{H}^1$-almost every point of $\Gamma$, the only tangent to $\Gamma$ is a straight line through the origin. In this article, we show that, in contrast, the infinitesimal structure of H\"older curves can be much more extreme. First we show that for every $s&gt;1$ there exists a $(1/s)$-H\"older curve $\Gamma_s$ in a Euclidean space with $\mathcal{H}^s(\Gamma_s)&gt;0$ such that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many topologically distinct tangents. Second, we study the tangents of self-similar connected sets (which are canonical examples of H\"older curves) and prove that the curves $\Gamma_s$ have the additional property that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many homeomorphically distinct tangents to $\Gamma_s$ which are not admitted as (not even bi-Lipschitz to) tangents to any self-similar set at typical points.</description>

      <title>The Small-Gain Condition for Infinite Networks Modeled on $\ell^{\infty}$-Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03925v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, attempts have been made to extend nonlinear small-gain theorems for input-to-state stability (ISS) from finite networks to countably infinite networks with finite indegrees. Under specific assumptions about the interconnection gains and the ISS formulation, corresponding infinite-dimensional small-gain results have been proven. However, concerning these assumptions, the results are still too narrow to be considered a full extension of the state-of-the-art for finite networks. We take a step to closing this gap by developing a general technical framework within which the small-gain condition for both finite and infinite networks can be analyzed. This includes a thorough investigation of various monotone operators associated with a network and a specific ISS formulation. Our results extend and generalize the existing theory for finite networks, yield complete characterizations of the small-gain condition for specific ISS formulations, and show which obstacles still have to be overcome to obtain a complete theory for the most general infinite case.</description>

      <title>Enabling Local Neural Operators to perform Equation-Free System-Level Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.</description>

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of probability distributions from time-dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including digital health. The goal is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, changes over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases such as diabetes. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a Gaussian mixture that captures the evolution of a continuous-time stochastic process. Our approach combines a nonparametric estimate of the distribution, obtained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that governs the temporal evolution of the mixture weights. The model is highly interpretable, detects subtle distribution shifts, and remains computationally efficient. We illustrate the broad utility of our approach in a 26-week clinical trial that treats all continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) time series as the primary outcome. This method enables rigorous longitudinal comparisons between the treatment and control arms and yields characterizations that conventional summary-based clinical trials analytical methods typically do not capture.</description>

      <title>The Single Ring Theorem and a Question of Shub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an orthogonally invariant probability measure on $GL(d,\mathbb{R})$, Mike Shub asked whether the average product of the $k$ top eigenvalues in the ensemble can be lower bounded by the average distortion along $k$ dimensional Grassmanians. Recently, Armentano, Chinta, Sahi, and Shub provided partial progress, however they attach a constant $c_{d,k} \to 0 as d \to \infty$. In this paper, by invoking the Single Ring Theorem and sequels, we show the conjecture asymptotically for the spectral radius, in particular, $c_{d,k} \to 1$ as $d \to \infty$, and $k = 1$.</description>
