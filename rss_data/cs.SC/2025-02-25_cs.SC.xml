      <title>A Generalized Inverse Matrix Theorem via Relational Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Invertible Matrix Theorem (IMT) characterizes equivalent notions of invertibility for square matrices. Moreover, for rectangular matrices, the IMT splits into separate characterizations of injectivity and surjectivity. In this work, we extend this result to linear relations, a generalization of linear maps that encode the solution sets of simultaneous linear systems. We develop a relational decomposition that structurally reveals the fundamental properties of linear relations: totality, determinism, injectivity, and surjectivity. These properties form a hierarchy, which we represent through a directed graph illustrating their logical dependencies. This leads to a natural generalization of the IMT to linear relations. Moreover, this relational decomposition also induces a decomposition for pairs of matrices that explicitly constructs bases for subspaces relevant to the images of both matrices, including their sum and intersection. In this sense, it is an analog of the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) requiring no assumptions on the underlying scalar field. This paper makes use of a graphical notation appropriate for the manipulation of relations. Although not strictly necessary, these diagrams enable equational reasoning and facilitate algebraic manipulations.</description>

      <title>Regular singular Mahler equations and Newton polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though Mahler equations have been introduced nearly one century ago, the study of their solutions is still a fruitful topic for research. In particular, the Galois theory of Mahler equations has been the subject of many recent papers. Nevertheless, long is the way to a complete understanding of relations between solutions of Mahler equations. One step along this way is the study of singularities. Mahler equations with a regular singularity at 0 have rather "nice" solutions: they can be expressed with the help of Puiseux series and solutions of equations with constant coefficients. In [FP22] the authors described an algorithm to determine whether an equation is regular singular at 0 or not. Exploiting information from the Frobenius method and Newton polygons, we improve this algorithm by reducing significantly its complexity, by providing some simple criterion for an equation to be regular singular at 0 and by extending its scope to equations with Puiseux coefficients.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Uncertainty of LLM Explanations: A Perspective Based on Reasoning Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the uncertainty in large language model (LLM) explanations is important for evaluating their faithfulness and reasoning consistency, and thus provides insights into the reliability of LLM's output regarding a question. In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies uncertainty in LLM explanations through a reasoning topology perspective. By designing a structural elicitation strategy, we guide the LLMs to frame the explanations of an answer into a graph topology. This process decomposes the explanations into the knowledge related sub-questions and topology-based reasoning structures, which allows us to quantify uncertainty not only at the semantic level but also from the reasoning path. It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process. Our method offers a systematic way to interpret the LLM reasoning, analyze limitations, and provide guidance for enhancing robustness and faithfulness. This work pioneers the use of graph-structured uncertainty measurement in LLM explanations and demonstrates the potential of topology-based quantification.</description>

      <title>FMplex: Exploring a Bridge between Fourier-Motzkin and Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03138v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a quantifier elimination method for conjunctions of linear real arithmetic constraints. Our algorithm is based on the Fourier-Motzkin variable elimination procedure, but by case splitting we are able to reduce the worst-case complexity from doubly to singly exponential. The adaption of the procedure for SMT solving has strong correspondence to the simplex algorithm, therefore we name it FMplex. Besides the theoretical foundations, we provide an experimental evaluation in the context of SMT solving. This is an extended version of the authors' work previously published at the fourteenth International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logics, and Formal Verification (GandALF 2023).</description>

      <title>Computation of classical and $v$-adic $L$-series of $t$-motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design an algorithm for computing the $L$-series associated to an Anderson $t$-motives, exhibiting quasilinear complexity with respect to the target precision. Based on experiments, we conjecture that the order of vanishing at $T=1$ of the $v$-adic $L$-series of a given Anderson $t$-motive with good reduction does not depend on the finite place $v$.</description>
