      <title>Rosetta Stone of Neural Mass Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain dynamics dominate every level of neural organization -- from single-neuron spiking to the macroscopic waves captured by fMRI, MEG, and EEG -- yet the mathematical tools used to interrogate those dynamics remain scattered across a patchwork of traditions. Neural mass models (NMMs) (aggregate neural models) provide one of the most popular gateways into this landscape, but their sheer variety -- spanning lumped parameter models, firing-rate equations, and multi-layer generators -- demands a unifying framework that situates diverse architectures along a continuum of abstraction and biological detail. Here, we start from the idea that oscillations originate from a simple push-pull interaction between two or more neural populations. We build from the undamped harmonic oscillator and, guided by a simple push-pull motif between excitatory and inhibitory populations, climb a systematic ladder of detail. Each rung is presented first in isolation, next under forcing, and then within a coupled network, reflecting the progression from single-node to whole-brain modeling. By transforming a repertoire of disparate formalisms into a navigable ladder, we hope to turn NMM choice from a subjective act into a principled design decision, helping both theorists and experimentalists translate between scales, modalities, and interventions. In doing so, we offer a \emph{Rosetta Stone} for brain oscillation models -- one that lets the field speak a common dynamical language while preserving the dialectical richness that fuels discovery.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Spectral Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate crystalline-like behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unitary quantum systems with extremely strong eigenvalue repulsion. Using a low-temperature Coulomb gas as a model of repulsive eigenvalues, we derive the Debye-Waller factor suppressing periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate the order of its singularities at multiples of the Heisenberg time. We also reproduce this crystalline-like behavior using perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles associated with Lax matrices. Our results lay a foundation for future studies of quantum systems that exhibit intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.</description>

      <title>Diffusion as a Signature of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While classical chaos is defined via a system's sensitive dependence on its initial conditions (SDIC), this notion does not directly extend to quantum systems. Instead, recent works have established defining both quantum and classical chaos via the sensitivity to adiabatic deformations and measuring this sensitivity using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP). Building on this formalism, we introduce the ``observable drift" as a probe of chaos in generic, non-Hamiltonian, classical systems. We show that this probe correctly characterizes classical systems that exhibit SDIC as chaotic. Moreover, this characterization is consistent with the measure-theoretic definition of chaos via weak mixing. Thus, we show that these two notions of sensitivity (to changes in initial conditions and to adiabatic deformations) can be probed using the same quantity, and therefore, are equivalent definitions of chaos. Numerical examples are provided via the tent map, the logistic map, and the Chirikov standard map.</description>

      <title>Regime identification and control of extremes in the non-autonomous Lorenz model with chaos and intransitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive chaos control has been studied extensively for autonomous systems. For real world, non-autonomous systems, such as the planetary weather, observations of the system state in response to seasonally and diurnally varying forcing are available only at discrete times and locations, over which system trajectories are likely to have diverged given uncertainties in initial conditions. We consider a stochastic representation of such systems, as a building block for adaptive control, and develop and test control strategies in an idealized setting. We present the first example of finite time adaptive chaos control for a seasonally forced and noise-perturbed Lorenz84 model. We demonstrate two strategies for triggering control: (1) local Lyapunov exponents (LLE), and (2) transition probabilities for the latent states of a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (NHMM). The second approach is motivated by thinking of future applications to a latent embedding space of planetary atmospheric circulation that would get us closer to real world analyses. The NHMM triggers are found to coincide with strongly positive LLE regimes, confirming their dynamical interpretability. These results provide a conceptual bridge towards the use of deep learning based weather and climate foundation models, whose hidden states could be leveraged for adaptive control to mitigate extreme weather events.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian of polymatrix zero-sum games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The understanding of a dynamical system's properties can be significantly advanced by establishing it as a Hamiltonian system and then systematically exploring its inherent symmetries. By formulating agents' strategies and cumulative payoffs as canonically conjugate variables, we identify the Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics of poly-matrix zero-sum games. We reveal the symmetries of our Hamiltonian and derive the associated conserved quantities, showing how the conservation of probability and the invariance of the Fenchel coupling are intrinsically encoded within the system. Furthermore, we propose the dissipation FTRL (DFTRL) dynamics by introducing a perturbation that dissipates the Fenchel coupling, proving convergence to the Nash equilibrium and linking DFTRL to last-iterate convergent algorithms. Our results highlight the potential of Hamiltonian dynamics in uncovering the structural properties of learning dynamics in games, and pave the way for broader applications of Hamiltonian dynamics in game theory and machine learning.</description>
