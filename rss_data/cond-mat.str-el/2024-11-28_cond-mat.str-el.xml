      <title>Analytic Continuation by Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic continuation aims to reconstruct real-time spectral functions from imaginary-time Green's functions; however, this process is notoriously ill-posed and challenging to solve. We propose a novel neural network architecture, named the Feature Learning Network (FL-net), to enhance the prediction accuracy of spectral functions, achieving an improvement of at least $20\%$ over traditional methods, such as the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), and previous neural network approaches. Furthermore, we develop an analytical method to evaluate the robustness of the proposed network. Using this method, we demonstrate that increasing the hidden dimensionality of FL-net, while leading to lower loss, results in decreased robustness. Overall, our model provides valuable insights into effectively addressing the complex challenges associated with analytic continuation.</description>

      <title>Singularity with and without disorder at AKLT points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) point of the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain is a cornerstone example of a disorder point where short-range correlations become incommensurate, and correlation lengths and momenta are non-analytic. While the presence of singularities appears to be generic for AKLT points, we show that for a family of SU(N) models, the AKLT point is not a disorder point: It occurs entirely within an incommensurate phase yet the wave vector remains singular on both sides of the AKLT point. We conjecture that this new possibility is generic for models where the representation is not self-conjugate and the transfer matrix non-Hermitian, while for self-conjugate representations the AKLT points remain disorder points.</description>

      <title>Metastability in Coexisting Competing Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical phase transition of a system with two coexisting competing order parameters is studied using the time-dependent-Ginzburg-Landau framework. The dynamics are induced by parameters capturing the physics of driving the system with an ultrafast laser pulse. A remarkable enhancement of the order parameter with a smaller mean-field value following the pump and the emergence of an induced metastable state is investigated through analytical and numerical studies. The effect of order parameter fluctuations on the exploration of the nonequilibrium free energy landscape reveals important information about the impact of both thermal and nonthermal fluctuations on the dynamics of the metastable state. Our results provide an interpretation of previously unexplained ultrafast experiments on superconductors with competing charge density wave order. Our formalism is relevant across broad classes of out-of-equilibrium systems beyond the condensed matter context, such as the Kibble-Zurek cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Structural and magnetic characterization of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with two-dimensional pseudospin-1/2 triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triangular lattice antiferromagnets are prototypes for frustrated magnetism and may potentially realize novel quantum magnetic states such as a quantum spin liquid ground state. A recent work suggests NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with rare-earth triangular lattice is a quantum spin liquid candidate and highlights the large family of rare-earth heptatantalates as a framework for quantum magnetism investigation. In this paper, we report the structural and magnetic characterization of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$. Both compounds are isostructural to NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with no detectable structural disorder. For CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$, the crystal field energy levels and parameters are determined by inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Based on the crystal field result, the magnetic susceptibility data could be well fitted and explained, which reveals that CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a highly anisotropic Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet ($g_z$/$g_{xy}$$\sim$3) with very weak exchange interaction (J$\sim$0.22~K). For YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$, millimeter sized single crystals could be grown. The anisotropic magnetization and electron spin resonance data show that YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ has a contrasting in-plane magnetic anisotropy with $g_z$/$g_{xy}$$\sim$0.67 similar as that of YbMgGaO$_4$. The above results indicate that CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with pseudospin-1/2 ground states might either be quantum spin liquid candidate materials or find applications in adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration due to the weak exchange interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing of a frustrated magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing, which involves quantum tunnelling among possible solutions, has state-of-the-art applications not only in quickly finding the lowest-energy configuration of a complex system, but also in quantum computing. Here we report a single-crystal study of the frustrated magnet $\alpha$-CoV$_2$O$_6$, consisting of a triangular arrangement of ferromagnetic Ising spin chains without evident structural disorder. We observe quantum annealing phenomena resulting from time-reversal symmetry breaking in a tiny transverse field. Below $\sim$ 1 K, the system exhibits no indication of approaching the lowest-energy state for at least 15 hours in zero transverse field, but quickly converges towards that configuration with a nearly temperature-independent relaxation time of $\sim$ 10 seconds in a transverse field of $\sim$ 3.5 mK. Our many-body simulations show qualitative agreement with the experimental results, and suggest that a tiny transverse field can profoundly enhance quantum spin fluctuations, triggering rapid quantum annealing process from topological metastable Kosterlitz-Thouless phases, at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Majorana Functional Renormalization for Frustrated XXZ-Z Spin-1/2 Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Nature of metallic and insulating domains in the CDW system 1T-TaSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure of bulk 1T-TaSe$_2$ in the charge density wave phase at low temperature. Our spatially and angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) data show insulating areas coexisting with metallic regions characterized by a chiral Fermi surface and moderately correlated quasiparticle bands. Additionally, high-resolution laser ARPES reveals variations in the metallic regions, with series of low-energy states, whose energy, number and dispersion can be explained by the formation of quantum well states of different thicknesses. Dynamical mean field theory calculations show that the observed rich behaviour can be rationalized by assuming occasional stacking faults of the charge density wave. Our results indicate that the diverse electronic phenomena reported previously in 1T-TaSe$_2$ are dictated by the stacking arrangement and the resulting quantum size effects while correlation effects play a secondary role.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid induced by U(1) gauge field interactions: a functional renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-Fermi-liquid state formed by an isotropic, degenerate Fermi gas in two spatial dimensions interacting with a U(1) gauge field. Our calculation uses the functional renormalization group (fRG) with a soft frequency cutoff for the fermions. The fRG scheme we employ takes account of the gauge symmetry, which imposes relations (modified Ward-Takahashi identities) between the couplings which constrain the RG flow. The critical exponents and couplings we find for the resulting non-Fermi liquid are mostly insensitive to whether or not we enforce the gauge symmetry constraints, which signifies either that the constraints are superfluous or that the frequency-cutoff scheme is particularly robust. The exception is the gauge-boson mass term, which is RG-relevant about the fixed point without the constraints, but is irrelevant when they are enforced. The latter is physically accurate, as a gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken. In addition, we find $z=2$ and $\Sigma(\omega,k_F)\sim\omega^{1/2}$ for the boson dynamical exponent and scaling of the fermion self-energy, respectively. These results differ considerably from those of past works on the model, though we argue for their plausibility.</description>

      <title>Chemo-Structural Disorder in the kagom\'e spin $S$ = 1/2 systems ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$ and YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6}$Br$_{2}$[Br$_x$(OH)$_{1-x}$]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By single crystal diffraction we characterize the chemo-structural disorder introduced by Zn-Cu site mixing in the kagom\'e spin $S$-1/2 systems herbertsmithite ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$ and YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6}$Br$_{2}$[Br$_x$(OH)$_{1-x}$]. For an untwinned single crystal of herbertsmithite of composition Zn$_{0.95(1)}$Cu$_{2.99(3)}$O$_{5.9(1)}$H$_{5.8(1)}$Cl$_2$ we find substitution by Cu of the Zn atoms in the layers separating the kagom\'e layers as well as substantial Zn substitution for Cu in the kagom\'e layers. In YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6}$Br$_{2}$[Br$_x$(OH)$_{1-x}$] site mixing disorder is present for intermediate $x$. Analogous to the Cl homologous system in crystals with $x = 1/3$ disorder is absent and a low-temperature structural transition emerges driven by strong magneto-phonon coupling as a release of frustration. Apart from this structural anomaly we find the physical properties of these crystals unchanged compared to intermediate $x$ and closely resembling the Cl homologue where long-range magnetic order was observed.</description>

      <title>Advancing Natural Orbital Functional Calculations Through Deep Learning-Inspired Techniques for Large-Scale Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural orbital functional (NOF) theory offers a promising approach for studying strongly correlated systems at an affordable computational cost, with an accuracy comparable to highly demanding wavefunction-based methods. However, its widespread adoption in cases involving a large number of correlated electrons has been limited by the extensive iterations required for convergence. In this work, we present a disruptive approach that embeds the techniques used for optimization in deep learning within the NOF calculation, representing a substantial advance in the scale of accessible systems. The revamped procedure is based on the adaptive momentum technique for orbital optimization, alternated with the optimization of the occupation numbers, significantly improving the computational feasibility of challenging calculations. We demonstrate this with three examples that involve a large number of electrons: (i) the symmetric dissociation of a large hydrogen cluster, (ii) an analysis of occupancies distribution in fullerenes, and (iii) a study of the singlet-triplet energy gap in linear acenes. Notably, the first example serves as an ideal model for a strongly correlated Mott insulator, featuring 1000 electrons and illustrating a metal-to-insulator transition, surpassing the largest calculations of strongly correlated electrons reported to date. We anticipate that this work will enable the practical application of NOFs to increasingly complex and intriguing systems, leveraging the method's inherent scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spin liquid properties of the kagome material Cu$_3$(HOTP)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal-organic-framework (MOF) compound Cu$_3$(HOTP)$_2$, a.k.a. Cu$_3$(HHTP)$_2$, is a small-gap semiconductor containing a kagome lattice of antiferromagnetically coupled $S$=1/2 Cu$^\mathrm{II}$ spins with intra-layer nearest-neighbor exchange coupling $J \sim $ 2 K. The intra-layer $J$ value obtained from DFT+U calculations is shown to match with the experimental value for reasonable values of U. Muon spin relaxation confirms no magnetic ordering down to 50~mK and sees spin fluctuations diffusing on a 2D lattice, consistent with a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state being present within highly decoupled kagome layers. Reduction of the spin diffusion rate on cooling from the paramagnetic region to the low-temperature QSL region reflects quantum entanglement. It is also found that the layers become more strongly decoupled in the low-temperature QSL region. Comparison of results for the spin diffusion, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat in the QSL region suggests close proximity to a quantum critical point and a large density of low energy spinless electronic excitations. A Z$_2$-linear Dirac model for the spin excitations of the QSL is found to provide the best match with experiment.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field tuned superconducting and normal phase magnetism in CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By tuning superconductivity with an applied magnetic field, we use neutrons to compare the magnetic ordered phases in superconducting and normal states of CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$. At zero field, CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$ displays both superconductivity ($T_{c}$=1.3 K) and spatially long-ranged commensurate $\uparrow\downarrow\uparrow\downarrow$ antiferromagnetism ($T_{N}$=2.5 K, $\vec{Q}_{0}=({1\over 2}, {1\over 2}, {1\over 2})$). Neutron spectroscopy fails to measure propagating magnetic excitations with only temporally overdamped fluctuations observable. On applying a magnetic field we find anisotropic behavior in the static magnetism. When the field is along the crystallographic $c$-axis, no change in the static magnetic response is observable. However when the field is oriented within the $a-b$ plane, an increase in $T_{N}$ and change in the critical response are measured. At low temperatures in the superconducting phase, the elastic magnetic intensity increases linearly ($\propto |H|$) with small $a-b$ oriented fields. However, this trend is interrupted at intermediate fields where commensurate block $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ magnetism with propagation vector $\vec{Q}=({1\over 2}, {1\over 2}, {1\over 4})$ forms. For large applied fields in the [1 $\overline{1}$ 0] direction which completely suppresses superconductivity, weakly incommensurate magnetic order along $L$ is observed to replace the commensurate response present in the superconducting and vortex phases. We suggest field-induced incommensurate static magnetism, present in the normal state of superconducting and antiferromagnetic CeCo$_{0.5}$Rh$_{0.5}$In$_{5}$ for $a-b$ plane oriented magnetic fields. We speculate that these field dependent properties are tied to the field induced anisotropy associated with the local Ce$^{3+}$ crystal field environment of the tetragonal `115' structure.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface and pseudogap in highly doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. Our findings reveal that the Fermi surface evolves smoothly with doping. Notably, the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, while nodal quasiparticle coherence increases monotonously. This demonstrates that the sharp increase in Hall carrier density recently observed above $x^{*}=0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1596 (2024)] cannot be attributed to the closure of the pseudogap. Further, we determine a temperature boundary of the pseudogap of $T^{*}\simeq~200~\textrm{K}$ for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates. Our results suggest that pseudogaps are a generic feature of doped quasi-2D antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, likely related to short range magnetic correlations.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry of Tilted Non-Hermitian Dirac Semimetals at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac materials, hosting linearly dispersing quasiparticles at low energies, exhibit an emergent Lorentz symmetry close to a quantum critical point (QCP) separating semimetallic state from a strongly-coupled gapped insulator or superconductor. This feature appears to be quite robust even in the open Dirac systems coupled to an environment, featuring non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac fermions: close to a strongly coupled QCP, a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry emerges in terms of a unique terminal velocity for both the fermion and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations, while the system can either retain non-Hermiticity or completely decouple from the environment thus recovering Hermiticity as an emergent phenomenon. We here show that such a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry can emerge at the quantum criticality even when the NH Dirac Hamiltonian includes a tilt term at the lattice scale. As we demonstrate by performing a leading order $\epsilon=3-d$ expansion close to $d=3$ upper critical dimension of the theory, a tilt term becomes irrelevant close to the QCP separating the NH Dirac semimetal and a gapped (insulating or superconducting) phase. Such a behavior also extends to the case of the linear-in-momentum non-tilt perturbation, introducing the velocity anisotropy for the Dirac quasiparticles, which also becomes irrelevant at the QCP. These predictions can be numerically tested in quantum Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the NH Hubbard-like models hosting low-energy NH tilted Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using time-dependent disorder in optical cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</description>

      <title>Localized obstructed pairs with zero superfluid stiffness from doping an antiferromagnetic insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic interactions play an important role in the pairing mechanism of strongly correlated superconductors, many of which share the layered oxide structure characteristic of the cuprate, nickelate, osmate, cobaltate, ruthenate, iridate family of high-temperature superconductors. We explore the consequences of strong magnetic interactions in a lattice model of strongly-interacting d-electrons separated by weakly-interacting p-electrons. In contrast with conventional t-J models where magnetic exchange emerges in the strong-coupling expansion of Hubbard-type models, in this framework Coulomb blockade emerges in the strong-coupling limit of spin-spin interactions. This results in an insulator at fractional filling without Hubbard interactions. Doping this correlated insulator creates localized Cooper pairs that live on the edges of a square lattice, with a d-wave form-factor. They realize the flat-band eigenfunction of the checkerboard lattice Hamiltonian, and have zero kinetic energy. We present a mean-field theory of superconductivity interpolating between this interaction-localized strong-pairing limit with d-wave Bose-Einstein condensation and a weak-pairing limit with a nodal Fermi surface gap, where the superfluid stiffness scale is controlled by the electron hopping integrals and the density, as usual. The pair wavefunction connects d-wave and s-wave molecular orbitals, so that the intra-band gap on the Fermi surface is parametrically smaller than the off-shell inter-band gap. We provide experimental predictions for this scenario of local pairing on link-orbitals, and strong incentive for ab-initio calculation of the relevant local energy scales in the strongly correlated materials tied together by the structural motif of ligands on links.</description>

      <title>Interplay of superconductivity and charge-density-wave order in kagome materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the \textit{A}V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (\textit{A}~$=$~K,~Rb,~Cs) kagome materials, superconductivity coexists with a charge density wave (CDW), constituting a new platform to study the interplay of these two orders. Despite extensive research, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter remains disputed, with experiments seemingly supporting different conclusions. As key aspects of the physics might lie in the intertwining of electronic orders, a better understanding of the impact of the CDW on superconductivity is crucial. In this work, we develop a phenomenological framework to study the interplay of superconductivity and CDW order. In particular, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau free energy for both superconducting and CDW order parameters. Given the unclear nature of the superconducting state, we discuss general pairing symmetries with a focus on $s$-wave, $d$-wave, and pair-density-wave order parameters. Motivated by experiments, we consider the additional breaking of time-reversal or point-group symmetries of the CDW and determine in detail the consequences for the superconducting state. Our results show how the superconducting state mimics the broken symmetries of the CDW and can guide future microscopic calculations, as well as the experimental identification of the superconducting state in the \textit{A}V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ compounds.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral properties of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional lattices: Anomalous Fermi singularities and polaron quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the exact spectral function of a single impurity repulsively interacting with a bath of fermions in one-dimensional lattices, by deriving the explicit expression of the form factor for both regular Bethe states and the irregular spin-flip state and $\eta$-pairing state, based on the exactly solvable Lieb-Wu model. While at low impurity momentum $Q\sim0$ the spectral function is dominated by two power-law Fermi singularities, at large momentum we observe that the two singularities develop into two-sided distributions and eventually become anomalous Fermi singularities at the boundary of the Brillouin zone (i.e., $Q=\pm\pi$), with the power-law tails extending towards low energy. Near the quarter filling of the Fermi bath, we also find two broad polaron peaks at large impurity momentum, collectively contributed by many excited many-body states with non-negligible form factors. Our exact results of those distinct features in one-dimensional Fermi polarons, which have no correspondences in two and three dimensions, could be readily probed in cold-atom laboratories by trapping highly imbalanced two-component fermionic atoms into one-dimensional optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Probing topological degeneracy on a torus using superconducting altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of topological order (TO) can be defined through the characteristic ground state degeneracy of a system placed on a manifold with non-zero genus $g$, such as a torus. This ground state degeneracy has served as a key tool for identifying TOs in theoretical calculations but it has never been possible to probe experimentally because fabricating a device in the requisite toroidal geometry is generally not feasible. Here we discuss a practical method that can be used to overcome this difficulty in a class of topologically ordered systems that consist of a TO and its time reversal conjugate $\overline{\rm TO}$. The key insight is that a system possessing such ${\rm TO}\otimes\overline{\rm TO}$ order fabricated on an annulus behaves effectively as TO on a torus, provided that one supplies a symmetry-breaking perturbation that gaps out the edge modes. We illustrate this general principle using a specific example of a spin-polarized $p_x\pm ip_y$ chiral superconductor which is closely related to the Moore-Read Pfaffian fractional quantum Hall state. Specifically, we introduce a simple model with altermagnetic normal state which, in the presence of an attractive interaction, hosts a helical $(p_x-ip_y)^\uparrow\otimes(p_x+ip_y)^\downarrow$ superconducting ground state. We demonstrate that when placed on an annulus with the appropriate symmetry-breaking edge perturbation this planar two-dimensional system, remarkably, exhibits the same pattern of ground state degeneracy as a $p_x+ ip_y$ superconductor on a torus. We discuss broader implications of this behavior and ways it can be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Detecting Standard Model Gauge Group from Generalized Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics stands as one of the most profound and successful frameworks for describing the fundamental workings of nature. The global form of the Standard Model gauge group, however, remains an open question: it can be $\left(SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\right)/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma=1,\mathbb{Z}_2,\mathbb{Z}_3$ or $\mathbb{Z}_6$. The work introduces the fractional topological transport coefficient $\xi$ involving the $U(1)$ B-L symmetry and the $U(1)$ one-form magnetic symmetry of the renormalizable Standard Model, and show that it distinguishes the global form of the Standard Model gauge group. The gauge group is fully determined for specific values of $\xi$, which also depends on the choice of action of the B-L symmetry on the Standard Model known as a fractionalization class. This transport coefficient can be measured in a contact term for the two-point function of the B-L symmetry current with the magnetic one-form symmetry current of the Standard Model. This parallels topological transport in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, with quarks and the B-L symmetry playing the role of anyons and the $U(1)$ electromagnetic global symmetry respectively.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Ising model on square-triangle tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square-triangle tilings to explore how the hyperuniformity, which characterizes long-range behavior of the point pattern, influences critical phenomena where long-range correlations play a crucial role. The square-triangle tilings are spatially random structures in two dimensions constructed by densely packing the plane with squares and triangles. The growth rule with a parameter $p$ proposed in our previous paper enables systematic generations of hyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, and antihyperuniform tilings. Classical Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model on these tilings show that critical behavior always belongs to the two-dimensional Ising universality class. It is clarified that the critical temperature is higher for the tiling with higher regularity in terms of hyperuniformity. Critical phenomena in the Ising models on the periodic and quasiperiodic tilings composed of the square and triangle tiles are also addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum field theories are a promising tool to study open quantum systems. These theories preserve unitarity if PT-symmetry is respected, and in that case an equivalent Hermitian description exists via the so-called Dyson map. Generically, PT-symmetric non-Hermitian theories can also feature phases where PT-symmetry is broken and unitarity is lost. We review the construction of holographic duals to strongly coupled PT-symmetric quantum field theories and the study of their phase diagram. We next focus on spacetime-dependent non-Hermitian couplings: non-Hermitian quenches and lattices. They violate the null energy condition in the gravity dual. The lattices realize phases supporting an imaginary current that breaks PT-symmetry spontaneously. Remarkably, these non-Hermitian lattices flow to a PT-symmetric fixed point in the IR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate the partition function and energy density of a massive scalar on a 2-sphere of radius $r$ and at finite temperature $\beta$ as power series in $\frac{\beta}{r}$. Each term in the power series can be written in terms of polylogarithms. We use this result to obtain the gap equation for the large $N$, critical $O(N)$ model with a quartic interaction on $S^1\times S^2$ in the large radius expansion. Solving the gap equation perturbatively we obtain the leading finite size corrections to the expectation value of stress tensor for the $O(N)$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$. Applying the Euclidean inversion formula on the perturbative expansion of the thermal two point function we obtain the finite size corrections to the expectation value of the higher spin currents of the critical $O(N)$ model. Finally we show that these finite size corrections of higher spin currents tend to that of the free theory at large spin as seen earlier for the model on $S^1\times R^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\mathrm{Ba}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$, a structural-analogue to the iron-based parent compound $\mathrm{Ba}\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$, offers a unique platform to study the interplay between superconductivity, charge density waves and, possibly, electronic nematicity. Here, we report on the growth and characterization of $\mathrm{Ba}_{1-x}\mathrm{Ca}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ single crystals with $0 \leq x \leq 0.1$, using a combination of x-ray diffraction, diffuse x-ray scattering, heat capacity, and electronic transport measurements. Our results demonstrate that calcium substitution affects the structural, electronic and thermodynamic properties of $\mathrm{Ba}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ in a way that is strongly reminiscent of moderate hydrostatic pressures albeit with marked differences. In particular Ca-substitution efficiently suppresses both the triclinic structural transition and the associated commensurate charge density wave formation, while increasing the superconducting transition temperature. We found that the substitution range in which the crystals remain homogeneous is limited as for concentrations $x \geq 0.04$ intense diffuse x-ray scattering indicates the formation of stacking faults, which, despite the preserved integrity of the NiAs layers, prevents investigation up to concentrations at which the chemical pressure would completely suppress the structural instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important property of neutron scattering data is that they can be normalised in absolute intensity units. In practice, however, such normalisation is often not performed, since it can be time-consuming and subject to systematic uncertainties. Here, a straightforward approach is presented for absolute intensity normalisation of neutron scattering data from polycrystalline samples. This approach uses the intensity scale factor obtained from a Rietveld refinement to normalise the data to the nuclear Bragg profile of the sample. Factors to convert the Rietveld scale factor into an absolute normalisation factor are tabulated for constant-wavelength and time-of-flight data refined using the popular programs Fullprof and GSAS-II. An example of the application of this method to experimental data is presented. Advantages, disadvantages, and extensions of this approach to spectroscopic data are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan anomaly using holography, finding that the $U(1)$ axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We also compute the thermal response of the Nieh-Yan term, revealing its characteristic $T^2$ dependence.</description>

Abstract: We study two related universal anomalies of the spectral function of cuprates, so called waterfall and high-energy kink features, by a combined cellular dynamical mean-field theory and angle-resolved photoemission study for the oxychloride Na$_x$Ca$_{2-x}$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (Na-CCOC). Tracing their origin back to an interplay of spin-polaron and local correlation effects both in undoped and hole-doped (Na-)CCOC, we establish them as a universal crossover between regions differing in the momentum dependence of the coupling and not necessarily in the related quasiparticles' energies. The proposed scenario extends to doping levels coinciding with the cuprate's superconducting dome and motivates further investigations of the fate of spin-polarons in the superconducting phase.</description>

      <title>Revelation of new magnetic domain wall category and spin-density-wave boundary state in itinerant magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional magnetic domain walls are typically characterized by the reorientation of local moments. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic boundaries of spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we observed that the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation, which generated a double-Q SDW state accompanied by a second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. The screw dislocations induced "half" vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. We find the spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls; while for the first time, we observed intriguing SDW in-gap states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new category of magnetic domain wall - the "interference wall", with a mechanism rooted in itinerant nature of the system.</description>

      <title>Loss-induced quantum information jet in an infinite temperature Hubbard chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information propagation in the one-dimensional infinite temperature Hubbard model with a dissipative particle sink at the end of a semi-infinite chain is studied. In the strongly interacting limit, the two-site mutual information and the operator entanglement entropy exhibit a rich structure with two propagating information fronts and superimposed interference fringes. A classical reversible cellular automaton model quantitatively captures the transport and the slow, classical part of the correlations, but fails to describe the rapidly propagating information jet. The fast quantum jet resembles coherent free particle propagation, with the accompanying long-ranged interference fringes that are exponentially damped by short-ranged spin correlations in the many-body background.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>

      <title>Enhanced localization in the prethermal regime of continuously measured many-body localized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localized systems exhibit a unique characteristic of avoiding thermalization, primarily attributed to the presence of a local disorder potential in the Hamiltonian. In recent years there has been an interest in simulating these systems on quantum devices. However, actual quantum devices are subject to unavoidable decoherence that can be modeled as coupling to a bath or continuous measurements. The quantum Zeno effect is also known to inhibit thermalization in a quantum system, where repeated measurements suppress transport. In this work we study the interplay of many-body localization and the many-body quantum Zeno effect. In a prethermal regime, we find that signatures of many-body localization are enhanced when the system is coupled to a bath that contains measurements of local fermion population, subject to the appropriate choice of system and bath parameters.</description>

      <title>Problem-tailored Simulation of Energy Transport on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <title>Entanglement smectic and stripe order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking and more recently entanglement are two cornerstones of quantum matter. We introduce the notion of anisotropic entanglement ordered phases, where the spatial profile of spin-pseudospin entanglement spontaneously lowers the four-fold rotational symmetry of the underlying crystal to a two-fold one, while the charge density retains the full symmetry. The resulting phases, which we term $\textit{entanglement smectic}$ and $\textit{entanglement stripe}$, exhibit a rich Goldstone mode spectrum and a set of phase transitions as a function of underlying anisotropies. We discuss experimental consequences of such anisotropic entanglement phases distinguishing them from more conventional charge or spin stripes. Our discussion of this interplay between entanglement and spontaneous symmetry breaking focuses on multicomponent quantum Hall systems realizing textured Wigner crystals, as may occur in graphene or possibly also in moir\'e systems, highlighting the rich landscape and properties of possible entanglement ordered phases.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and Hyperuniformity in Quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard Models with and without Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of local superfluid amplitude and boson density. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a significant increase of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. The order metric clarifies if the distribution of a physical quantity reflects the point distribution or not, and quantifies how complex the distribution is in comparison with the point distribution. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

Abstract: We review recent progress regarding the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and other $p$-local quantum mechanical random Hamiltonians. These models exhibit an expansion using chord diagrams, which can be solved by combinatorial methods. We describe exact results in these models, including their spectrum, correlation functions, and Lyapunov exponent. In a certain limit, these techniques manifest the relation to the Schwarzian quantum mechanics, a theory of quantum gravity in $AdS_2$. More generally, the theory is controlled by a rigid algebraic structure of a quantum group, suggesting a theory of quantum gravity on non-commutative $q$-deformed $AdS_2$. We conclude with discussion of related universality classes, and survey some of the current research directions.</description>

Abstract: We report the crystal structures and superconductivity (SC) of LaPt$_{x}$Si$_{2-x}$ ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1.0$) that are solid solutions of LaSi$_{2}$ and LaPtSi with centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}/amd$, $D_{4h}^{19}$, \#141) and non-centrosymmetric tetragonal ($I4_{1}md$, $C_{4v}^{11}$, \#109) structures, respectively. It was found that at $0.86 \leq x \leq 1.00$, the non-centrosymmetric tetragonal symmetry is preserved, while partial disorder appears in alternating Pt and Si of the hyper-honeycomb network. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ was drastically reduced from 3.9 K to 1.5 K as $x$ varies from 1.0 to 0.86. Additionally, a hexagonal phase with an AlB$_{2}$-type structure ($P6/mmm$, $D_{6h}^{1}$, \#191) has been discovered at $0.50 \leq x \leq 0.71$ with a honeycomb network of statistically distributed Pt and Si atoms. The hexagonal phase exhibited SC at $T_{\rm c} = 0.38$ K. This system provides an opportunity to investigate the relationship between topological electronic states, SC, and disorders</description>

      <title>An effective framework for strange metallic transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-holography, originally proposed as a model for conducting lattice electrons coupled to a holographic critical sector, leads to an effective theory of non-Fermi liquids with only a few relevant interactions on the Fermi surface in the large $N$ limit. A refined version of such theories has only two effective couplings which give holographic and Fermi-liquid-like contributions to the self-energy, respectively. We show that a low co-dimension sub-manifold exists in the space of refined semi-holographic theories in which strange metallic behavior is manifested, and which can be obtained just by tuning the ratio of the two couplings. On this sub-manifold, the product of the spectral function and the temperature is approximately independent of the critical exponent, the Fermi energy, and the temperature at all frequencies and near the Fermi surface when expressed in terms of suitably scaled momentum and frequency variables. This quasi-universal behavior leads to linear-in-$T$ dc resistivity and Planckian dissipation over a large range of temperatures, and we also obtain $T^{-3}$ scaling of the Hall conductivity at higher temperatures. The quasi-universal spectral function also fits well with photoemission spectroscopic data without varying the critical exponent with the doping. Combining with the results for optical conductivity, we construct a generalized version of Drude phenomenology for strange-metallic behavior which satisfies non-trivial consistency tests. Finally, we discuss a possible dynamical mechanism for the fine-tuning of the ratio of the two couplings necessary to realize the strange metallic behavior in a typical state.</description>

      <title>Giant Heat Flux Effect in Non-Chiral Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of heat transport in non-chiral transmission lines (TLs) of quantum Hall edge channels coupled to Ohmic contacts (OCs) that accounts for a dynamical accumulation of charge in the reservoirs. As a consequence, heat transport is driven by charge fluctuations in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. This framework challenges conventional paradigms by revealing a giant heat flux effect-a significant amplification in heat transport arising from non-trivial fluctuation-dissipation relations. Through a Langevin-based approach, we derive the effective noise power in the chiral currents, which underlies this enhanced heat flux. Our findings predict clear experimental signatures unique to non-chiral TLs, as well as provide insights into finite-frequency effects, showing crossovers to more conventional diffusive behavior. This work offers a perspective on feedback mechanisms in quasi-1D heat transport with implications for dissipation control in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fully nonequilibrium Hall response from Berry curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.</description>
