      <title>NEXUS: Efficient and Scalable Multi-Cell mmWave Baseband Processing with Heterogeneous Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of 5G New Radio (NR), particularly in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, imposes stringent demands on the flexibility, scalability, and efficiency of baseband processing. While virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRANs) enable dynamic spectrum sharing across cells, compute resource allocation for baseband processing, especially in multi-cell deployments with heterogeneous workloads, remains underexplored. In this paper, we present NEXUS, the first system to realize real-time, virtualized multi-cell mmWave baseband processing on a single server with heterogeneous compute resources. NEXUS integrates software-based digital signal processing pipelines with hardware-accelerated LDPC decoding, and introduces a novel framework for sharing Intel's ACC100 eASIC across multiple CPU cores via virtual functions (VFs). For single-cell operation, NEXUS employs a random forest (RAF)-based model that predicts the most energy-efficient resource allocation for the given cell configuration with microsecond-level inference latency and high accuracy. For multi-cell scenarios, NEXUS introduces a power-aware scheduler that incorporates a lightweight contention model to adjust resource allocation strategies under concurrent execution. Through extensive evaluation across various Frequency Range 2 (FR2) cell configurations, we show that NEXUS supports up to 16 concurrent cells under full load, achieving 5.37Gbps aggregate throughput, while reducing the multi-cell scheduling search space by orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that virtualized, resource-aware baseband processing is both practical and efficient for next-generation vRAN systems.</description>

      <title>Path Dynamics in a Deployed Path-Aware Network: A Measurement Study of SCIONLab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path-aware networks promise enhanced performance and resilience through multipath transport, but a lack of empirical data on their real-world dynamics hinders the design of effective protocols. This paper presents a longitudinal measurement study of the SCION architecture on the global SCIONLab testbed, characterizing the path stability, diversity, and performance crucial for protocols like Multipath QUIC (MPQUIC). Our measurements reveal a dynamic environment, with significant control-plane churn and short path lifetimes in parts of the testbed. We identify and characterize path discrepancy, a phenomenon where routing policies create asymmetric path availability between endpoints. Furthermore, we observe a performance trade-off where concurrent multipath transmissions can improve aggregate throughput but may degrade the latency and reliability of individual paths. These findings demonstrate that protocols such as MPQUIC should explicitly account for high churn and path asymmetry, challenging common assumptions in multipath protocol design.</description>

      <title>Where Have All the Firewalls Gone? Security Consequences of Residential IPv6 Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IPv4 NAT has limited the spread of IoT botnets considerably by default-denying bots' incoming connection requests to in-home devices unless the owner has explicitly allowed them. As the Internet transitions to majority IPv6, however, residential connections no longer require the use of NAT. This paper therefore asks: has the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 ultimately made residential networks more vulnerable to attack, thereby empowering the next generation of IPv6-based IoT botnets? To answer this question, we introduce a large-scale IPv6 scanning methodology that, unlike those that rely on AI, can be run on low-resource devices common in IoT botnets. We use this methodology to perform the largest-scale measurement of IPv6 residential networks to date, and compare which devices are publicly accessible to comparable IPv4 networks. We were able to receive responses from 14.0M distinct IPv6 addresses inside of residential networks (i.e., not the external-facing gateway), in 2,436 ASes across 118 countries. These responses come from protocols commonly exploited by IoT botnets (including telnet and FTP), as well as protocols typically associated with end-user devices (including iPhone-Sync and IPP). Comparing to IPv4, we show that we are able to reach more printers, iPhones, and smart lights over IPv6 than full IPv4-wide scans could. Collectively, our results show that NAT has indeed acted as the de facto firewall of the Internet, and the v4-to-v6 transition of residential networks is opening up new devices to attack.</description>

      <title>Temporal Spectrum Analysis for Multi-Constellation Space Domain Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space Domain Awareness (SDA) system has different major aspects including continues and robust awareness from the network that is crucial for an efficient control over all actors in space. The observability of the space assets on the other hand requires efficient analysis on when and how observed space objects can be controlled. This becomes crucial when real-world spatial dynamics are taken into account as it introduces complexities into the system. The real-world dynamics can reveal the structure of the network including isolated and dominant stations. We propose a Temporal Spectrum Analysis (TSA) scheme that takes into account a set of real-world parameters including actual dynamics of the objects in space to analyze the structure of a ground-space network that inherits temporal spectrum as the key element of design. We study the potential interactions between multiple constellations using TSA and conduct a comprehensive real-world simulations to quantify the structure of the network. Numerical results show how the temporal spectrum of each satellite affects the intra- and inter-constellation network structure including interactions between ground stations and constellations.</description>

      <title>MULTI-SCOUT: Multistatic Integrated Sensing and Communications in 5G and Beyond for Moving Target Detection, Positioning, and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are extracted for every target. For a single target, bistatic delays are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account for receiver clock synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.</description>

      <title>Overlapping IPv4, IPv6, and TCP data: exploring errors, test case context and multiple overlaps inside network stacks and NIDSes with PYROLYSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IP fragmentation and TCP segmentation allow for splitting large data packets into smaller ones, e.g., for transmission across network links of limited capacity. These mechanisms permit complete or partial overlaps with different data on the overlapping portions. IPv4, IPv6, and TCP reassembly policies, i.e., the data chunk preferences that depend on the overlap types, differ across protocol implementations. This leads to vulnerabilities, as NIDSes may interpret the packet differently from the monitored host OSes. Some NIDSes, such as Suricata or Snort, can be configured so that their policies are consistent with the monitored OSes. The first contribution of the paper is PYROLYSE, an audit tool that exhaustively tests and describes the reassembly policies of various IP and TCP implementation types. This tool ensures that implementations reassemble overlapping chunk sequences without errors. The second contribution is the analysis of PYROLYSE artifacts. We first show that the reassembly policies are much more diverse than previously thought. Indeed, by testing all the overlap possibilities for n &lt;= 3 test case chunks and different testing scenarios, we observe from 14 to 20 different behaviors out of 23 tested implementations depending on the protocol. Second, we report eight errors impacting one OS, two NIDSes, and two embedded stacks, which can lead to security issues such as NIDS pattern-matching bypass or DoS attacks. A CVE was assigned to a NIDS error. Finally, we show that implemented IP and TCP policies obtained through chunk pair testing are usually inconsistent with the observed triplet reassemblies. Therefore, contrarily to what they currently do, NIDSes or other network traffic analysis tools should not apply n = 2 pair policies when the number of overlapping chunks exceeds two.</description>

      <title>A Modular and Scalable Simulator for Connected-UAVs Communication in 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular-connected UAV systems have enabled a wide range of low-altitude aerial services. However, these systems still face many challenges, such as frequent handovers and the inefficiency of traditional transport protocols. To better study these issues, we develop a modular and scalable simulation platform specifically designed for UAVs communication leveraging the research ecology in wireless communication of MATLAB. The platform supports flexible 5G NR node deployment, customizable UAVs mobility models, and multi-network-interface extensions. It also supports multiple transport protocols including TCP, UDP, QUIC, etc., allowing to investigate how different transport protocols affect UAVs communication performance. In addition, the platform includes a handover management module, enabling the evaluation of both traditional and learning-based handover strategies. Our platform can serve as a testbed for the development and evaluation of advanced transmission strategies in cellular-connected UAV systems.</description>

      <title>Using Causality for Enhanced Prediction of Web Traffic Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting web service traffic has significant social value, as it can be applied to various practical scenarios, including but not limited to dynamic resource scaling, load balancing, system anomaly detection, service-level agreement compliance, and fraud detection. Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</description>
