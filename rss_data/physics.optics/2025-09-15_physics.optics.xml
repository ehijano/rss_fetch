      <title>Generation of UV-Vis correlated photon pairs using PP-LaBGeO5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SHG and SPDC output of a periodically poled bulk LBGO crystal is measured. The SHG efficiency is measured to be (3.52 +/- 0.04) x 10^-3 %/W. The SPDC output is temporally characterized by a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometer; a maximum CAR of 244 and pair generation rate of (1.45 +/- 0.47) x 10^6 pairs s^-1 mW^-1 is measured. An EMICCD spectrometer is used to measure the spectral characteristics of the PP-LBGO source. Of the four gratings tested, one operational grating (poling period = 2.10 um) of the PP-LBGO device outputs a temperature tunable spectrum of entangled photon pairs centered at 532 nm with signal and idler photons being tunable from 507 to 556 nm, respectively. The work paves the way for future waveguided entangled photon sources reaching UV wavelengths using periodic poling.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Microwave-to-Optics Conversion Utilizing a Hybrid Photonic-Phononic Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and coherent conversion between microwave and optical signals is crucial for a wide range of applications, from quantum information processing to microwave photonics and radar systems. However, existing conversion techniques rely on cavity-enhanced interactions, which limit the bandwidth and calability. Here, we demonstrate the first multi-channel microwave-to-optics conversion by introducing a traveling-wave architecture that leverages a hybrid photonic-phononic waveguide on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). Our approach exploits continuous phase-matching rather than discrete resonances, enabling unprecedented operational bandwidths exceeding 40 nm in the optical domain and 250 MHz in the microwave domain. By harnessing the strong piezoelectric and photoelastic effects of TFLN, we achieve coherent conversion between 9 GHz microwave photons and 1550 nm telecom photons via traveling phonons, with an internal efficiency of 2.2% (system efficiency 2.4 *10^-4 ) at room temperature. Remarkably, we demonstrate simultaneous operation of nine conversion channels in a single device. Our converter opens up new opportunities for seamless integration of microwave and photonic technologies, enabling the quantum interface for distributed quantum computing with superconducting quantum processors, high efficient microwave signal processing, and advanced radar applications.</description>

      <title>Optical tweezers assisted coupling of nematic droplets to gold nanoparticle cluster: Effect on whispering gallery modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dye doped liquid crystal (LC) microdroplets exhibit tunable optical resonances modulated by size, shape, temperature, and external perturbations. When a dye-doped nematic microdroplet is coupled to a gold nanoparticle cluster, near-field interactions enhance local electric fields, boosting fluorescence emission. Optical tweezers serve as a tool for the parking of dye doped nematic microdroplets on gold nanoparticle clusters, enabling the dynamic coupling and excitation of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). This configuration resulted in amplified WGMs, with a clearly detectable shift in the spectral position. Resonance mode red shifts confirmed efficient photonic plasmonic coupling, with up to seven nm tunability achieved without significant degradation of the Q-factor. The magnitude of tunability depends on the size of the gold nanoparticle cluster. Also, the WGM emission spectrum of the nematic microdroplet can be reversibly tuned by decoupling from the gold nanoparticle cluster.</description>

      <title>Low-Frequency Scattering of TE and TM Waves by an Inhomogeneous Medium with Planar Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stationary scattering of TE and TM waves propagating in an isotropic medium with planar symmetry is described by Bergmann's equation in one dimension. This is a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer matrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency scattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the scattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the construction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose time-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct the low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and transmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of Brewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive analytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of this method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when the carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary conditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space. Because acoustic waves propagating in a compressible fluid with planar symmetry are also described by Bergmann's equation, our results apply to the low-frequency scattering of these waves.</description>

      <title>Detection of the laser induced damage using a He Ne laser reflective imaging technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced damage is a serious challenge for optical components; therefore, determining the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) is a crucial step in the manufacturing process. In many cases, such as for space applications, it is also necessary to account for the vacuum environment. Since conventional damage detection methods face limitations under vacuum conditions, an alternative approach is required. This article introduces a He-Ne laser imaging system designed for in-situ damage detection within a LIDT station. The system enables fourfold magnification imaging of the test sample and its surroundings without placing imaging optics inside the vacuum chamber, thereby preserving the cleanliness of the chamber. The detection method can be applied to both transparent and opaque samples; in transparent optics, damage is observable from either side. To verify the system's functionality, two sample types were investigated: a silica wafer (non-transparent for He-Ne radiation) and a commonly used dielectric mirror for 1030 nm (transparent for He-Ne radiation). Particular attention was devoted to determining the minimum damage size that can be reliably recognized. The system successfully distinguished damage features as small as 35 ${\mu}$m.</description>

      <title>Digital holographic imaging of superfluid helium free surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualising the free surface of superfluid helium offers a rare opportunity to explore wave dynamics in the limit of vanishing viscosity. Such measurements are nonetheless challenging due to helium's low refractive index contrast, restricted optical access to the cryogenic setups required to maintain helium in its superfluid phase, and mechanical vibrations from the various cooling stages. Overcoming these limitations will enable quantitative studies of surface-wave dynamics with applications in fluid mechanics, quantum simulation, and quantum optomechanics. Here we report the first implementation of off-axis digital holography for full-field imaging of the free surface of superfluid $^{\text{4}}$He. We perform non-contact measurements of nanometre- to micrometre-scale interface fluctuations in two cryogenic systems: a traditional helium bath cryostat and a cryogen-free refrigerator. We employ machine-learning-based analysis to isolate noise-driven normal modes and their spatial structure in both systems. This enables reconstruction of the dispersion relation for gravity-capillary waves in macroscopic samples and, for thick films, determination of the film thickness from the measured dispersion, providing a quantitative benchmark for our approach. These proof-of-concept experiments show that digital holography is a powerful and versatile tool for high-resolution, minimally invasive studies of superfluid surfaces, with strong potential for integration into diverse experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Sculpting Topological Modes on Photonic Chips by Artificial Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant efforts have been devoted to manipulating topological states, which often manifest as localized modes at interfaces between distinct topological phases. In this work, we demonstrate a versatile approach to sculpting topological modes (TMs) into any desired shapes by incorporating various artificial gauge fields (AGFs), including scalar, vector, and imaginary gauge potentials, and leveraging the power of artificial neural networks (ANNs). These AGFs enable precise tuning of the dissipation of the TMs across that of bulk modes, facilitating a transition from localized to fully delocalized states. Moreover, ANNs allow precise engineering of these eigenmodes to achieve tailored profiles of topological states, which remain spectrally isolated within the bandgap and exhibit minimal loss compared to other modes. Our theoretical results are experimentally validated on silicon photonic platforms, demonstrating flexible manipulation of TM profiles. This approach enables the design of topological states with customized properties, offering significant potential for diverse applications in photonics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift of normally incident beam on magneto-optical meta-grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift of normally incident optical beam to meta-grating consisted of magneto-optical material are studied. The meta-grating is consisted of compound grating of magneto-optical rod on top of a dielectric slab, which induces zone-folding quasi-bound states in the continuum at the $\Gamma$ point with non-zero group velocity. By applying stationary-phase theory, the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift of normally incident quasi-plane wave are found to be enhanced at the reflection peak. Simulations of normally incident Gaussian beam with finite beam width show that the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift is dependent on the beam width.</description>

      <title>Optical branched flow in nonlocal nonlinear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When light propagates through a randomly correlated, slowly varying medium, it generates optical branched flow. Previous studies have demonstrated that the self-focusing effect in optical media can accelerate the appearance of the first branching points and sharpen the filaments of branched flow. In this study, we investigate the influence of the nonlocality of the nonlinear response on branched flow. We find that, due to its averaging effect, as the range of nonlocality increases, the first branching point shifts to a greater distance, and the flow structures broaden, thus nonlocality ultimately restores the branched flow to its linear condition. We have developed a semi-analytical formula and confirmed the screening of the self-focusing effect on branching flow by nonlocality.</description>

      <title>No oscillating subradiant correlations in a strongly driven quantum emitter array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study time-dependent correlations in a strongly driven array of $N$ two-level atoms, coupled to photons in a waveguide. We focus on the spectrum $\{\lambda\}$ of the Liouvillian superoperator, which determines the correlation decay rates $-\Re \lambda$ and the frequencies $\Im\lambda$. Our main finding is the suppression of subradiant oscillating correlations between atomic states by a strong coherent of amplitude $\Omega$: $|\Re \lambda|\ge m\gamma/2$, where $\gamma$ is the single-atom spontaneous decay rate and $m=|\Im \lambda/(2\Omega)|$ is a nonzero integer for correlations oscillating in time $\propto \exp(\pm 2i m|\Omega| t)$. This limit is independent of the number of atoms $N$; it holds both for small arrays and in the macroscopic limit. We demonstrate the suppression of subradiance numerically and provide a rigorous proof based on the analytical decomposition of the Liouvillian using spectral theory of simplicial complexes and posets.</description>

      <title>Bistability of optical properties of cesium vapor due to collective interaction of alignment and orientation under strong spin exchange conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-like alkali atoms with a single valence electron are the most common objects in quantum optics and, at the same time, serve as essential tools of the field. Under conditions of optical pumping, strong spin-exchange and ultra-weak magnetic field (spin-exchange relaxation free mode, SERF), ensembles of such atoms in the gas phase can demonstrate not only the absence of spin-exchange relaxation, but also nonlinear collective effects. We present experimental evidence that the alignment, i.e. the quadrupole momentum, can not only be preserved under SERF conditions, but also coexist and interact with the orientation, i.e. the dipole momentum. We also show that this interaction leads to bistability: a small change in conditions can cause the medium to transition to a different steady state, an effect characterized by hysteresis. The combination of properties of this effect opens up a wide range of applications as optical keys or memory elements with a storage time of hundreds of seconds in tasks of quantum information and cryptography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution equations for the moments of a photonic quantum state propagating through atmospheric turbulence are derived. These evolution equations are obtain from an evolution equation for the characteristic functional of the state, incorporating all spatiotemporal degrees of freedom. The measured quantities, such as the intensity or photon distribution, of the evolving state can be expressed in terms of such moments without having to know the exact final state. The case of an initial coherent state is considered as an example.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits underlying spatiotemporal chaos in the Lugiato-Lefever model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain and investigate theoretically a broad family of stable and unstable time-periodic orbits-oscillating Turing rolls (OTR)-in the Lugiato-Lefever model of optical cavities. Using the dynamical systems tools developed in fluid dynamics, we access the OTR solution branches in parameter space and elucidate their bifurcation structure. By tracking these exact invariant solutions deeply into the chaotic region of the modulation instability, we connect the main dynamical regimes of the Lugiato-Lefever model: continuous waves, Turing rolls, solitons, and breathers, which completes the classical phase diagram of the optical cavity. We then demonstrate that the OTR periodic orbits play a fundamental role as elementary building blocks in the regime of the intracavity field transition from stable Turing rolls to fully developed turbulent regimes. Depending on the cavity size, we observe that the chaotic intracavity field driven by modulation instability displays either spatiotemporal or purely temporal intermittancy between chaotic dynamics and different families of the OTR solutions, exhibiting locally the distinctive wave patterns and large amplitude peaks. This opens avenues for a theoretical description of optical turbulence within the dynamical systems framework.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Squeezed-Light Chips</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed-light generation in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is essential for scalable continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. By suppressing quantum fluctuations below the shot-noise limit, squeezed states enable quantum-enhanced sensing and serve as a standard resource for CV quantum information processing. While chip-level squeezed-light sources have been demonstrated, extending this capability to the wafer level with reproducible strong squeezing to bolster large-scale quantum-enhanced sensing and information processing has been hindered by squeezed light's extreme susceptibility to device imperfections. Here, we report wafer-scale fabrication, generation, and characterization of two-mode squeezed-vacuum states on a fully complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) PIC platform. Across a 4-inch wafer, 8 dies yield 2.9-3.1 dB directly measured quadrature squeezing with $&lt; 0.2$ dB variation, demonstrating excellent uniformity. This performance is enabled by co-integrating ultralow-loss, strongly overcoupled high-$Q$ microresonators, cascaded pump-rejection filters, and low-loss inverse-tapered edge couplers. The measurements agree with a first-principles theoretical model parameterized solely by independently extracted device parameters and experimental settings. The measured squeezing level can be further improved by enhancing the efficiencies of off-chip detection and chip-to-fiber coupling. These results establish a reproducible, wafer-scale route to nonclassical-light generation in integrated photonics and lay the groundwork for scalable CV processors, multiplexed entanglement sources, and quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <title>TorchGDM: A GPU-Accelerated Python Toolkit for Multi-Scale Electromagnetic Scattering with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present "torchGDM", a numerical framework for nano-optical simulations based on the Green's Dyadic Method (GDM). This toolkit combines a hybrid approach, allowing for both fully discretized nano-structures and structures approximated by sets of effective electric and magnetic dipoles. It supports simulations in three dimensions and for infinitely long, two-dimensional structures. This capability is particularly suited for multi-scale modeling, enabling accurate near-field calculations within or around a discretized structure embedded in a complex environment of scatterers represented by effective models. Importantly, torchGDM is entirely implemented in PyTorch, a well-optimized and GPU-enabled automatic differentiation framework. This allows for the efficient calculation of exact derivatives of any simulated observable with respect to various inputs, including positions, wavelengths or permittivity, but also intermediate parameters like Green's tensor components, which can be interesting for physics informed deep learning applications. We anticipate that this toolkit will be valuable for applications merging nano-photonics and machine learning, as well as for solving nano-photonic optimization and inverse problems, such as the global design and characterization of metasurfaces, where optical interactions between structures are critical.</description>

Abstract: We report a mid-infrared ring laser via fiber-to-waveguide hybrid integration enabled by directional couplers fabricated in fluoride glasses. Directional couplers were inscribed into fluoride glass using femtosecond laser direct writing, forming low-loss waveguides with a high positive refractive index change. The waveguides were optimized for efficient guidance at a wavelength of 2.7 {\textmu}m. Directional couplers with systematically varied coupling gap and interaction lengths were fabricated and experimentally characterized, demonstrating controllable power splitting ratios spanning from complete transmission (100:0) to balanced coupling (50:50). A directional coupler with a 7 {\textmu}m coupling gap and a 1.5 mm interaction length, providing an 80:20 power splitting ratio, was integrated with a cladding-pumped Er:ZBLAN fiber to realize a ring laser cavity. The resulting device produced stable lasing at 2716.7 nm with an output power of 14.2 mW. This work represents the first realization of a fully fiber-chip integrated mid-infrared laser source and opens new avenues for 3D photonic integration in fluoride glasses, enabling design flexibility previously unattainable in traditional fiber-optics architectures.</description>

      <title>Accessible, All-Polymer Metasurfaces: Low Effort, High Quality Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04896</link>

Abstract: Optical metasurfaces supporting resonances with high quality factors offer an outstanding platform for applications such as non-linear optics, light guiding, lasing, sensing, light-matter coupling, and quantum optics. However, their experimental realization typically demands elaborate multi-step procedures such as metal or dielectric deposition, lift-off, and reactive ion etching. As a consequence, accessibility, large-scale production and sustainability are constrained by reliance on cost-, time- and labor-intensive facilities. We overcome this fabrication hurdle by repurposing polymethyl methacrylate-which is usually employed as a temporary resist-as the resonator material, thereby eliminating all steps except for spin-coating, exposure and development. Because the low refractive index of the polymer limits effective mode formation, we present a bilayer recipe that enables the convenient fabrication of a freestanding membrane to maximize the index contrast with its surroundings. Since etching induced defects are circumvented, the membrane features high quality nanopatterns. We further examine the suspended membrane with scanning electron microscopy and extract its position-dependent spring constant and pretension with nanoindentation experiments applied by the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our all-polymer metasurface hosting Bound States in the Continuum experimentally delivers high quality factors (up to 523) at visible and near infrared wavelengths, despite the low refractive index of the polymer, and enables straightforward geometry-based tuning of both linewidth and resonance position. We envision this methodology to lay the groundwork for accessible, high performance metasurfaces with unique use cases such as material blending, angled writing and mechanically based resonance tuning.</description>
