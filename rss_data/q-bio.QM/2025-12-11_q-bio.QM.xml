      <title>Digital Modeling of Spatial Pathway Activity from Histology Reveals Tumor Microenvironment Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables simultaneous mapping of tissue morphology and spatially resolved gene expression, offering unique opportunities to study tumor microenvironment heterogeneity. Here, we introduce a computational framework that predicts spatial pathway activity directly from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained histology images at microscale resolution 55 and 100 um. Using image features derived from a computational pathology foundation model, we found that TGFb signaling was the most accurately predicted pathway across three independent breast and lung cancer ST datasets. In 87-88% of reliably predicted cases, the resulting spatial TGFb activity maps reflected the expected contrast between tumor and adjacent non-tumor regions, consistent with the known role of TGFb in regulating interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, linear and nonlinear predictive models performed similarly, suggesting that image features may relate to pathway activity in a predominantly linear fashion or that nonlinear structure is small relative to measurement noise. These findings demonstrate that features extracted from routine histopathology may recover spatially coherent and biologically interpretable pathway patterns, offering a scalable strategy for integrating image-based inference with ST information in tumor microenvironment studies.</description>

      <title>Understanding temperature tuning in energy-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models of complex systems often require post-hoc parameter adjustments to produce useful outputs. For example, energy-based models for protein design are sampled at an artificially low ''temperature'' to generate novel, functional sequences. This temperature tuning is a common yet poorly understood heuristic used across machine learning contexts to control the trade-off between generative fidelity and diversity. Here, we develop an interpretable, physically motivated framework to explain this phenomenon. We demonstrate that in systems with a large ''energy gap'' - separating a small fraction of meaningful states from a vast space of unrealistic states - learning from sparse data causes models to systematically overestimate high-energy state probabilities, a bias that lowering the sampling temperature corrects. More generally, we characterize how the optimal sampling temperature depends on the interplay between data size and the system's underlying energy landscape. Crucially, our results show that lowering the sampling temperature is not always desirable; we identify the conditions where \emph{raising} it results in better generative performance. Our framework thus casts post-hoc temperature tuning as a diagnostic tool that reveals properties of the true data distribution and the limits of the learned model.</description>

      <title>Riemannian vs. Euclidean Representation of Gait Kinematics: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of complex human movements, such as gait, is essential for clinical diagnosis and rehabilitation but is often limited by traditional linear models rooted in Euclidean geometry. These frameworks frequently fail to capture the intrinsic non-linear dynamics and posture-dependent dependencies of biological systems. To address this, we present a computational framework that maps kinematic data onto a Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. Using the Log-Euclidean metric, we transformed raw skeletal pose sequences into geometric feature vectors to quantify gait variability and smoothness across three velocity profiles: slow, medium, and fast. Our comparative analysis reveals a critical divergence between geometric approaches. While Euclidean metrics exhibit a strictly linear increase in variability with speed (Slow &lt; Medium &lt; Fast), implying instability, the proposed Riemannian metrics reveal a non-linear "inverted-U'' pattern with varying speeds. Specifically, we observed a stabilization of variance at high speeds (sprinting), suggesting that the motor system optimizes efficiency by adhering to geodesic trajectories of minimum effort. These findings demonstrate that manifold-based representations offer superior sensitivity to biomechanical efficiency compared to standard linear methods, providing a robust foundation for future diagnostic algorithms and explainable machine learning models in clinical biomechanics.</description>

      <title>Deep Multi-modal Breast Cancer Detection Network</title>

Abstract: Automated breast cancer detection via computer vision techniques is challenging due to the complex nature of breast tissue, the subtle appearance of cancerous lesions, and variations in breast density. Mainstream techniques primarily focus on visual cues, overlooking complementary patient-specific textual features that are equally important and can enhance diagnostic accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Multi-modal Cancer Detection Network (MMDCNet) that integrates visual cues with clinical data to improve breast cancer detection. Our approach processes medical images using computer vision techniques while structured patient metadata patterns are learned through a custom fully connected network. The extracted features are fused to form a comprehensive representation, allowing the model to leverage both visual and clinical information. The final classifier is trained based on the joint features embedding space of visual and clinical cues and experiments prove enhanced performance, improving accuracy from 79.38\% to 90.87\% on a Mini-DDSM dataset. Additionally, our approach achieves 97.05\% accuracy on an image-only dataset, highlighting the robustness and effectiveness of visual feature extraction. These findings emphasise the potential of multi-modal learning in medical diagnostics, paving the way for future research on optimising data integration strategies and refining AI-driven clinical decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Discontinuities in the Topology of Alzheimers gene Co-expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18238</link>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) emerges from a complex interplay of molecular, cellular, and network-level disturbances that are not easily captured by traditional reductionist frameworks. Conventional analyses of gene expression often rely on thresholded correlation networks or clustering-based module detection, approaches that may obscure nonlinear structure and higher-order organization. Here, we introduce a comparative topological framework that makes use of topological data analysis (TDA) and the Mapper algorithm to detect discontinuities - localized disruptions in the topology of gene co-expression space between healthy and AD brain tissue. Using gene expression data from 3 brain regions, we mapped how AD reshapes the global topology of gene-gene relationships. Discontinuity hotspots were identified via variability-based node scoring and subjected to Gene Ontology Biological Process enrichment analysis. This work illustrates the potential of TDA to uncover disease-relevant structure in high-dimensional transcriptomic data and motivates broader application of shape-based comparative methods in neurodegeneration research and other areas that benefit from comparative analysis.</description>

      <title>Exact identifiability analysis for a class of partially observed near-linear stochastic differential equation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochasticity plays a key role in many biological systems, necessitating the calibration of stochastic mathematical models to interpret associated data. For model parameters to be estimated reliably, it is typically the case that they must be structurally identifiable. Yet, while theory underlying structural identifiability analysis for deterministic differential equation models is highly developed, there are currently no tools for the general assessment of stochastic models. In this work, we present a differential algebra-based framework for the structural identifiability analysis of linear and a class of near-linear partially observed stochastic differential equation (SDE) models. Our framework is based on a deterministic recurrence relation that describes the dynamics of the statistical moments of the system of SDEs. From this relation, we iteratively form a series of necessarily satisfied equations involving only the observed moments, from which we are able to establish structurally identifiable parameter combinations. We demonstrate our framework for a suite of linear (two- and $n$-dimensional) and non-linear (two-dimensional) models. Most importantly, we define the notion of structural identifiability for SDE models and establish the effect of the initial condition on identifiability. We conclude with a discussion on the applicability and limitations of our approach, and potential future research directions in this understudied area.</description>

      <title>SimpleFold: Folding Proteins is Simpler than You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18480v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.</description>
