      <title>Riemannian Geometry of Lie Groups with One and Two-Dimensional Commutator Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate left invariant Riemannian metrics on Lie groups with one and two-dimensional commutator subgroups. We explicitly provide the Levi-Civita connection, sectional curvature, and Ricci curvature, and we give computable necessary and sufficient conditions for these Riemannian manifolds to be Ricci solitons. Furthermore, we characterize all Ricci solitons on Lie groups with one-dimensional commutator subgroups. In the final section, we examine the results concerning all indecomposable Lie groups with two-dimensional commutator subgroups of dimension greater than or equal to five.</description>

      <title>On the sub-Riemannian geometry of the quaternionic Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of quaternionic contact geometry, we define a sequence of Riemannian metrics $\{g_L\}$ on the quaternionic Heisenberg group $\mathfrak{H}_{\mathbb{H}}$ by rescaling the vertical directions. By analyzing the limit of this sequence, we characterize the Carnot-Carath\'eodory geodesics and provide the explicit description of the Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance and spheres in $\mathfrak{H}_{\mathbb{H}}$ . Furthermore, we derive a general formula for the horizontal mean curvature of hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Finite Index and Do Carmo Question for Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any finite $\delta$-index hypersurface $M$ in ${\mathbb R}^{n+1}$ with constant mean curvature must be minimal, provided
  - the volume growth of $M$ is sub-exponential;
  - the Ricci curvature of $M$ satisfies $\operatorname{Ric}_M\geq -\frac{4(1-\delta)}{n-1}|A|^2g,$ where $A$ is the second fundamental form and $g$ is the metric on $M.$
  In the second case, our result further implies that, in addition to being minimal, such an $M$ must be a hyperplane.
  Notice that, we do not have any restriction on the dimension and that the second result is new also in the case of finite index hypersurfaces ($\delta=0$).</description>

      <title>Cohomological Equation for Robotic Screw Motion on the Lie Group SE(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomological equation associated with screw motions on the Euclidean motion group SE(3). Working on the smooth manifold M = T^3 x SO(3), we combine Fourier analysis in the translational variables with Peter-Weyl theory on SO(3) to reduce the equation to a family of finite-dimensional linear transport systems along frequency orbits induced by the rotational component. In the case of finite-order rotations, solvability is governed by explicit finite-dimensional linear obstructions encoded by monodromy operators. An explicit screw motion along the z-axis illustrates the resulting resonance conditions. Since rigid motions on SE(3) arise naturally as configuration spaces in robotic kinematics, the results provide a precise description of obstruction phenomena relevant to robotic rigid-body motion.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Lagrangian B-Spline Framework for Point Cloud Manifold Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our recent curve-evolution framework based on localized B-spline interpolation to present an adaptive Lagrangian framework for the geometric evolution of point-cloud data representing smooth, codimension-one surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The method constructs overlapping, localized tensor-product B-spline patches, enabling direct, meshless surface evolution from discrete samples. Within each patch, the differentiable B-spline representation yields analytic, high-order estimates of intrinsic geometric invariants, supporting curvature-driven and geometry-coupled flows. The organization of control points facilitates coherent updates of both surface samples and spline coefficients under intrinsic velocity fields. A conditioning-aware formulation of the local interpolation system, combined with a Gauss-Seidel refinement of control points, maintains interpolation quality throughout the evolution. Adaptive knot insertion and point redistribution, guided by geometric error indicators and local sampling density, preserve surface resolution and regularity during deformation. Numerical experiments demonstrate efficient and accurate reproduction of surface evolution phenomena, including mean-curvature flow, anisotropic deformations, and coupled surface-field dynamics, establishing localized B-spline methods as precise and versatile tools for dynamic manifold approximation.</description>

      <title>The canonical lamination calibrated by a cohomology class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension $2 \leq d \leq 7$, and let $\rho \in H^{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ have unit norm. We construct a lamination $\lambda_\rho$ whose leaves are exactly the minimal hypersurfaces which are calibrated by every calibration in $\rho$. The geometry of $\lambda_\rho$ is closely related to the the geometry of the unit ball of the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$, and so we deduce several results constraining the geometry of the stable norm ball in terms of the topology of $M$. These results establish a close analogy between the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}(M, \mathbb R)$ and the earthquake norm on the tangent space to Teichm\"uller space.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$ manifolds for any $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with kinks and the asymptotic behavior of the graph Laplacian operator with Gaussian kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce manifolds with kinks, a class of manifolds with possibly singular boundary that notably contains manifolds with smooth boundary and corners. We derive the asymptotic behavior of the Graph Laplace operator with Gaussian kernel and its deterministic limit on these spaces as bandwidth goes to zero. We show that this asymptotic behavior is determined by the inward sector of the tangent space and, as special cases, we derive its behavior near interior and singular points. Lastly, we show the validity of our theoretical results using numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Backwards uniqueness for Mean curvature flow with asymptotically conical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that if two mean curvature flows of compact hypersurfaces $M^1_t$ and $M^2_t$ encounter only isolated, multiplicity one, asymptotically conical singularities at the first singular time $T$, and if $M^1_T=M^2_T$ then $M^1_t=M^2_t$ for every $t\in [0,T]$. This is seemingly the first backwards uniqueness result for any geometric flow with singularities, that assumes neither self-shrinking nor global asymptotically conical behaviour. This necessitates the development of new global tools to deal with both the core of the singularity, its asymptotic structure, and the smooth part of the flows simultaneously. As an immediate application, we show that low entropy flows in $\mathbb{R}^4$ are backwards unique</description>

      <title>On the invariant surface area functionals in 3-dimensional CR geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cheng, Yang, and Zhang have studied two invariant surface area functionals in 3-dimensional CR manifolds. They deduced the Euler-Lagrange equations of the associated energy functionals when the 3-dimensional CR manifold has constant Webster curvature and vanishing torsion. In this paper, we deduce the Euler-Lagrange equations of the energy functionals in a more general 3-dimensional CR manifold. Moreover, we study the invariant area functionals on the disk bundle, on the Rossi sphere, and on 3-dimensional tori.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of holonomy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the following monotonicity result for the holonomy group: Given a sequence of metric connections converging in $C^0$ such that all its members have holonomy contained in a closed group $H$, also their limit connection needs to have holonomy contained in $H$. As a corollary, for a sequence of Riemannian metrics converging in $C^1$ and having special restricted holonomy, their limit metric must also have special restricted holonomy. In particular, this implies that the map assigning to Riemannian metrics on a manifold the conjugacy classes of their restricted holonomy groups is lower semicontinuous with respect to the order relation given by inclusion of representatives.</description>

      <title>On sporadic symmetry breaking operators for principal series representations of the de Sitter and Lorentz groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct and classify all differential symmetry breaking operators between certain principal series representations of the pair $SO_0(4,1) \supset SO_0(3,1)$. In this case, we also prove a localness theorem, namely, all symmetry breaking operators between the principal series representations in concern are necessarily differential operators. In addition, we show that all these symmetry breaking operators are sporadic in the sense of T. Kobayashi, that is, they cannot be obtained by residue formulas of meromorphic families of symmetry breaking operators.</description>
