      <title>Trigonometric Ratios Can Prove the Pythagorean Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interest in noncircular trigonometric proofs has underscored the need for alternative methodologies. Jackson and Johnson's 2024 study addresses a longstanding gap in the foundations of trigonometric proofs. Inspired by the work of Jackson and Johnson [JJ24], we present three noncircular proofs of the Pythagorean theorem based on trigonometric identities. First, we establish the Pythagorean theorem via an isosceles triangle construction and the tangent double-angle formula. Second, we present an alternative proof utilizing an isosceles-triangle and the angle-bisector theorem. Third, we derive a novel trigonometric relation from the angle-bisector theorem, thereby unifying and extending the two preceding approaches. These approaches collectively demonstrate that the principal contribution of Jackson and Johnson lies in their strategic use of the double-angle formula. These proofs clarify the role of trigonometric identities independent of infinite series.</description>

      <title>Meaning as Use, Application, Employment, Purpose, Usefulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arising from the whole body of Wittgenstein's writings is a picture of a (not necessarily straight, linear, but admittedly tireless) journey to come to terms with the mechanics of language as an instrument to conceive `reality' and to communicate an acquired conception of the `world'. The journey passes through mathematics, psychology, color perception, certainty, aesthetic, but, looking at it from a sort of birdview, it seems reasonable to say that these are all used as `test beds' for his reflections and `experimentations' towards an all encompassing perspective of such a fundamental gateway to human reasoning and life-revealing as language. Whatever labelling of Wittgenstein as a mystic, a logicist, a conventionalist, a skeptic, an anti-metaphysics, an anti-realist, a verificationist, a pragmatist, and many others, does not seem to do justice to his absolute obsession with being a persistent `deep diver' into the nature of language. Working with an open and searchable account of the Nachlass has allowed us to identify important aspects of the philosopher's possible common line of thinking, in spite of changes of directions, some of them acknowledged by Wittgenstein himself. One of those aspects is the association of meaning with use, application, purpose, usefulness of symbols in language, which happens to show itself from the very beginning through to the very late writings. The German terms Gebrauch, Anwendung, \emph{Verwendung}, Zweck in relation to meaning, sense of signs, words, sentences, appear in several texts since the WW1 Notebooks (1914--1916) up until very late manuscripts from 1950--51.</description>

      <title>An introduction to graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a graduate-level introduction to graph theory, corresponding to a quarter-long course. It covers simple graphs, multigraphs as well as their directed analogues, and more restrictive classes such as tournaments, trees and arborescences. Among the features discussed are Eulerian circuits, Hamiltonian cycles, spanning trees, the matrix-tree and BEST theorems, proper colorings, Turan's theorem, bipartite matching and the Menger and Gallai--Milgram theorems. The basics of network flows are introduced in order to prove Hall's marriage theorem.
  Around a hundred exercises are included (without solutions).</description>
