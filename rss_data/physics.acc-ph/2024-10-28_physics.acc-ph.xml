      <title>The effect of space charge on photon-enhanced thermionic emission in the presence of the bidirectional discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bidirectional space charge effects in photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) devices are investigated systematically. First, we precisely determine the carrier concentrations and cathode temperatures by taking into account the electron recycling effect, energy balance constraints, and space charge effects arising from the concurrent discharge of the cathode and anode. Next, we analyze the impact of critical parameters, including anode properties and operating conditions, on the space charge barrier distribution and the overall performance of the device. The results demonstrate that the impact of reverse discharge on the net current becomes more pronounced when the PETE device operates at high anode temperatures, low anode work functions, and with a moderate solar concentration ratio and gap width. This discovery not only deepens our understanding of the bidirectional space charge effect, but also provides valuable guidance for the future optimization of PETE device performance.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization Model for Composite Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) model to describe the magnetization and instantaneous power loss of composite superconductors subject to time-varying magnetic fields. Once the parameters of the ROHM model are fixed based on reference simulations, it allows to directly compute the macroscopic response of composite superconductors without the need to solve the detailed current density distribution. It can then be used as part of a homogenization method in large-scale superconducting models to significantly reduce the computational effort compared to detailed simulations. In this contribution, we focus on the case of a strand with twisted superconducting filaments subject to a time-varying transverse magnetic field. We propose two levels of ROHM models: (i) a rate-independent model that reproduces hysteresis in the filaments, and (ii) a rate-dependent model that generalizes the first level by also reproducing dynamic effects due to coupling and eddy currents. We describe the implementation and inclusion of these models in a finite element framework, discuss how to deduce the model parameters, and finally demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in terms of accuracy and efficiency over a wide range of excitation frequencies and amplitudes.</description>
