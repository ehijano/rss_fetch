      <title>Fast and Fourier Features for Transfer Learning of Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training machine learning interatomic potentials that are both computationally and data-efficient is a key challenge for enabling their routine use in atomistic simulations. To this effect, we introduce franken, a scalable and lightweight transfer learning framework that extracts atomic descriptors from pretrained graph neural networks and transfer them to new systems using random Fourier features-an efficient and scalable approximation of kernel methods. Franken enables fast and accurate adaptation of general-purpose potentials to new systems or levels of quantum mechanical theory without requiring hyperparameter tuning or architectural modifications. On a benchmark dataset of 27 transition metals, franken outperforms optimized kernel-based methods in both training time and accuracy, reducing model training from tens of hours to minutes on a single GPU. We further demonstrate the framework's strong data-efficiency by training stable and accurate potentials for bulk water and the Pt(111)/water interface using just tens of training structures. Our open-source implementation (https://franken.readthedocs.io) offers a fast and practical solution for training potentials and deploying them for molecular dynamics simulations across diverse systems.</description>

      <title>A LightGBM-Incorporated Absorbing Boundary Conditions for the Wave-Equation-Based Meshless Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A LightGBM-Incorporated absorbing boundary condition (ABC) computation approach for the wave-equation-based the radial point interpolation meshless (RPIM) method is proposed to simulate wave propagation in open space during the computation process. Different strageties are implemented for replacing the conventional perfectly matched layers (PMLs) in the computational domain. In this work, the model is used to predict the field components on the boundary at each time step to improve computational efficiency. The effectiveness and high efficiency of our method is verified by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Computational Homogenization in 3D Magnetostatics using E3C Hyper-Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently published hyper-reduction method "Empirically Corrected Cluster Cubature" (E3C) is for the first time applied in three dimensions (here magnetostatics). The method is verified to give accurate results even for a small number of integration points, such as 15 for 3D microstructure simulations. The influence of the number of snapshots and modes, as well as the number of integration points, is investigated and the set with the best performance is selected, showing hyper-reduction errors of less than 1%. Exemplary simulations, including a two-scale simulation are considered illustrating the performance of the E3C method for 3D simulations.</description>

      <title>Fast recovery of parametric eigenvalues depending on several parameters and location of high order exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical algorithm is proposed to deal with parametric eigenvalue problems involving non-Hermitian matrices and is exploited to find location of defective eigenvalues in the parameter space of non-hermitian parametric eigenvalue problems. These non-Hermitian degeneracies also called exceptional points (EP) have raised considerable attention in the scientific community as these can have a great impact in a variety of physical problems. The method first requires the computation of high order derivatives of a few selected eigenvalues with respect to each parameter involved. The second step is to recombine these quantities to form new coefficients associated with a partial characteristic polynomial (PCP). By construction, these coefficients are regular functions in a large domain of the parameter space which means that the PCP allows one to recover the selected eigenvalues as well as the localization of high order EPs by simply using standard root-finding algorithms. The versatility of the proposed approach is tested on several applications, from mass-spring systems to guided acoustic waves with absorbing walls and rooms acoustics. The scalability of the method to large sparse matrices arising from conventional discretization techniques such as the finite element method is demonstrated. The proposed approach can be extended to a large number of applications where EPs play an important role in quantum mechanics, optics and photonics or in mechanical engineering.</description>

      <title>Entropy plateaus can emerge from gas replacement at a characteristic halo mass in simulated groups and clusters of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is driven by a complex interplay between gravitational collapse, radiative cooling, and baryonic feedback associated with galaxy formation. Using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of a group of mass $8.83 \times 10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and a cluster of mass $2.92 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ at $z=0$, we investigate the emergence of entropy plateaus at characteristic halo masses and their connection to feedback mechanisms. We use the SWIFT-EAGLE model with three resolution levels, down to an initial particle gas mass of $2.29 \times 10^5$ M$_\odot$ and dark matter particle mass of $1.23 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$. Our analysis reveals that when halos reach $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, their entropy profiles flatten at the virial radius, marking a transition where AGN feedback begins to dominate over supernova-driven regulation. By tracking the Lagrangian history of gas particles, we demonstrate that this entropy buildup is driven primarily by AGN feedback, which efficiently removes low-entropy gas from progenitors of groups and clusters, redistributing it throughout the IGM before the gas can fall into the core region. Recent XMM-Newton observations of X-GAP local groups reveal large entropy excesses and flat cores, in line with our predicted plateaus and in contrast to the steeper, power-law-like profiles of previous observations. While these predicted plateaus may be observationally confirmed in unbiased samples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy profiles, from flat cores to cool-core power laws, remains an outstanding challenge for next-generation feedback models. We suggest that current AGN feedback models may be overly efficient in expelling low-entropy gas from the potential cool-core $10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, disrupting the balance between heating and cooling required to sustain long-lived cool cores.</description>

      <title>Cerium doped graphene-based materials towards oxygen reduction reaction catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the global transition towards cleaner energy and sustainable processes, the demand for efficient catalysts, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction, has gained attention from the scientific community. This research work investigates cerium-doped graphene-based materials as catalysts for this process with density functional theory calculations. The electrochemical performance of Ce-doped graphene was assessed within the computation hydrogen electrode framework. Our findings reveal that Ce doping, especially when synergized with an oxygen atom, shows improved catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, Ce doping in combination with an oxygen atom, located near a border, can be selective for the 2-electron pathway. Overall, the combination of Ce doping with structural defects and oxygenated functions lowers the reaction free energies for the oxygen reduction compared to pure graphene, and consequently, might improve the catalytic activity. This research sheds light from a computational perspective on Ce-doped carbon materials as a sustainable alternative to traditional costly metal-based catalysts, offering promising prospects for green energy technologies and electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism-Guided Inverse Engineering Framework to Unlock Design Principles of H-Bonded Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diverse combinations of novel building blocks offer a vast design space for hydrogen-boned frameworks (HOFs), rendering it a great promise for gas separation and purification. However, the underlying separation mechanism facilitated by their unique hydrogen-bond networks has not yet been fully understood. In this work, a comprehensive understanding of the separation mechanisms was achieved through an iterative data-driven inverse engineering approach established upon a hypothetical HOF database possessing nearly 110,000 structures created by a material genomics method. Leveraging a simple yet universal feature extracted from hydrogen bonding information with unambiguous physical meanings, the entire design space was exploited to rapidly identify the optimization route towards novel HOF structures with superior Xe/Kr separation performance (selectivity &gt;103). This work not only provides the first large-scale HOF database, but also demonstrates the enhanced machine learning interpretability of our model-driven iterative inverse design framework, offering new insights into the rational design of nanoporous materials for gas separation.</description>

      <title>Generative Discovery of Partial Differential Equations by Learning from Math Handbooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a promising approach for uncovering the underlying laws governing complex systems. However, purely data driven techniques face the dilemma of balancing search space with optimization efficiency. This study introduces a knowledge guided approach that incorporates existing PDEs documented in a mathematical handbook to facilitate the discovery process. These PDEs are encoded as sentence like structures composed of operators and basic terms, and used to train a generative model, called EqGPT, which enables the generation of free form PDEs. A loop of generation evaluation optimization is constructed to autonomously identify the most suitable PDE. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework can recover a variety of PDE forms with high accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in cases involving complex temporal derivatives or intricate spatial terms, which are often beyond the reach of conventional methods. The approach also exhibits generalizability to irregular spatial domains and higher dimensional settings. Notably, it succeeds in discovering a previously unreported PDE governing strongly nonlinear surface gravity waves propagating toward breaking, based on real world experimental data, highlighting its applicability to practical scenarios and its potential to support scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of the structural and elastic properties of 2H-MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (M = W, Mo, Ta, Nb; X = S, Se). Using density functional theory with various van der Waals exchange-correlation functionals, we systematically investigate the influence of nonlocal interactions on lattice parameters, elastic constants, and mechanical moduli. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between semiconducting and metallic TMDs: metallic compounds exhibit larger in-plane lattice parameters and reduced interlayer spacing, consistent with their bonding characteristics. We find that metallic TMDs display significantly lower in-plane stiffness and shear modulus compared to their semiconducting counterparts. We discuss this behaviour in the context of the observed charge density waves. In addition, we establish clear trends in the bulk, Young's, and shear moduli, demonstrating the role of atomic number and chemical composition in determining mechanical stability.</description>

      <title>TTNOpt: Tree tensor network package for high-rank tensor compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed TTNOpt, a software package that utilizes tree tensor networks (TTNs) for quantum spin systems and high-dimensional data analysis. TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by locally optimizing the network structure, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors. For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation. The optimized TTN shows that its structure isolates the variables from each other. (3) Reconstruction of the matrix product network representing a $16$-variable normal distribution characterized by a tree-like correlation structure. TTNOpt can reveal hidden correlation structures of the covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Fast Differentiable Modal Simulation of Non-linear Strings, Membranes, and Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modal methods for simulating vibrations of strings, membranes, and plates are widely used in acoustics and physically informed audio synthesis. However, traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von K\'arm\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability, limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library, providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling. Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling and sound synthesis.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silica is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature, enabling their analysis at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La- APT). In this study, we show that UV and deep-UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>ProME: An Integrated Computational Platform for Material Properties at Extremes and Its Application in Multicomponent Alloy Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have built an integrated computational platform for material properties at extreme conditions, ProME (Professional Materials at Extremes) v1.0, which enables integrated calculations for multicomponent alloys, covering high temperatures up to tens of thousands of Kelvin, high pressures up to millions of atmospheres, and high strain rates up to millions per second. A series of software packages have been developed and integrated into ProME v1.0, including ABC (AI-Based Crystal search) for crystal structure search under pressure, SAE (Similar Atomic Environment) for disordered configuration modeling, MFP$^2$ (Multiphase Fast Previewer by Mean-Field Potential) for multiphase thermodynamic properties, HTEM (High-throughput Toolkit for Elasticity Modeling) for thermo-elastic properties, TREX (TRansport at Extremes) for electrical and thermal conductivity, Hippos (High plastic phase model software) for phase-field simulation of microstructure evolution under high strain rates, and AutoCalphad for modeling and optimization of phase diagrams with variable compositions. ProME v1.0 has been applied to design the composition of the quaternary alloys Platinum-Iridium-Aluminum-Chromium (Pt-Ir-Al-Cr) for engine nozzles of aerospace attitude-orbit control, achieving high-temperature strength comparable to the currently used Pt-Ir alloys but with significantly reduced costs for raw materials. ProME offers crucial support for advancing both fundamental scientific understanding and industrial innovation in materials research and development.</description>

The Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit is widely used to model backgrounds in nuclear and particle physics experiments. While its current modules for simulating (n, $\gamma$) signals, G4NDL and G4PhotoEvaporation, are excellent for many applications, they do not reproduce known gamma-ray lines and correlations relevant at 2-15 MeV. G4CASCADE is a new data-driven Geant4 module that simulates (n, $\gamma$) de-excitation pathways, with options for how to handle shortcomings in nuclear data. Benchmark comparisons to measured gamma-ray lines and level structures in the ENSDF database show significant improvements, with decreased residuals and full energy conservation. This manuscript describes the underlying calculations performed by G4CASCADE, its various usage options, and benchmark comparisons. G4CASCADE for Geant4-10 is available on GitHub at https://github.com/UCRDarkMatter/CASCADE</description>

      <title>Code-Verification Techniques for an Arbitrary-Depth Electromagnetic Slot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04004</link>

Abstract: Electromagnetic slot models are employed to efficiently simulate electromagnetic penetration through openings in an otherwise closed electromagnetic scatterer. Such models, which incorporate varying assumptions about the geometry of the openings, are typically coupled with electromagnetic surface integral equations that model electromagnetic scattering. In this paper, we introduce novel code-verification approaches and build upon our previously developed methodologies to assess the correctness of the numerical implementation of an arbitrary-depth slot model. Through these approaches, we measure the convergence rates of the different interacting sources of numerical error and demonstrate the impact of various factors on these rates for several cases.</description>

      <title>Exploring exponential time integration for strongly magnetized charged particle motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental task in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of plasma physics is solving for charged particle motion in electromagnetic fields. This problem is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized due to numerical stiffness arising from the wide separation in time scales between highly oscillatory gyromotion and overall macroscopic behavior of the system. In contrast to conventional finite difference schemes, we investigated exponential integration techniques to numerically simulate strongly magnetized charged particle motion. Numerical experiments with a uniform magnetic field show that exponential integrators yield superior performance for linear problems (i.e. configurations with an electric field given by a quadratic electric scalar potential) and are competitive with conventional methods for nonlinear problems with cubic and quartic electric scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>SuperBench: A Super-Resolution Benchmark Dataset for Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to enhance data resolution, enabling the retrieval of finer details, and improving the overall quality and fidelity of the data representation. There is growing interest in applying SR methods to complex spatiotemporal systems within the Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) community, with the hope of accelerating numerical simulations and/or improving forecasts in weather, climate, and related areas. However, the lack of standardized benchmark datasets for comparing and validating SR methods hinders progress and adoption in SciML. To address this, we introduce SuperBench, the first benchmark dataset featuring high-resolution datasets, including data from fluid flows, cosmology, and weather. Here, we focus on validating spatial SR performance from data-centric and physics-preserved perspectives, as well as assessing robustness to data degradation tasks. While deep learning-based SR methods (developed in the computer vision community) excel on certain tasks, despite relatively limited prior physics information, we identify limitations of these methods in accurately capturing intricate fine-scale features and preserving fundamental physical properties and constraints in scientific data. These shortcomings highlight the importance and subtlety of incorporating domain knowledge into ML models. We anticipate that SuperBench will help to advance SR methods for science.</description>

      <title>MachMachine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Identifying Split Vacancy Defects with Machine-Learned Foundation Models and Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A striking example is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic energy lowering and change in behaviour. These species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for the efficient identification of these defects, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all solid-state compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of low energy split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of (foundation) machine-learning potentials, with important caveats, the significant prevalence of split vacancy defects in inorganic solids, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for defect modelling.</description>
