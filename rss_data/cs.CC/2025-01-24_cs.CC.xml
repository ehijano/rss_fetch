      <title>On Deciding the Data Complexity of Answering Linear Monadic Datalog Queries with LTL Operators(Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our concern is the data complexity of answering linear monadic datalog queries whose atoms in the rule bodies can be prefixed by operators of linear temporal logic LTL. We first observe that, for data complexity, answering any connected query with operators $\bigcirc/\bigcirc^-$ (at the next/previous moment) is either in AC0, or in $ACC0\!\setminus\!AC0$, or $NC^1$-complete, or LogSpace-hard and in NLogSpace. Then we show that the problem of deciding LogSpace-hardness of answering such queries is PSpace-complete, while checking membership in the classes AC0 and ACC0 as well as $NC^1$-completeness can be done in ExpSpace. Finally, we prove that membership in AC0 or in ACC0, $NC^1$-completeness, and LogSpace-hardness are undecidable for queries with operators $\Diamond_f/\Diamond_p$ (sometime in the future/past) provided that $NC^1 \ne NLogSpace$, and $LogSpace \ne NLogSpace$.</description>

      <title>On one-way functions and the average time complexity of almost-optimal compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that one-way functions exist if and only if there exists an efficient distribution relative to which almost-optimal compression is hard on average. The result is obtained by combining a theorem of Ilango, Ren, and Santhanam and one by Bauwens and Zimand.</description>

      <title>Modular Counting CSP: Reductions and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is ubiquitous in various areas of mathematics and computer science. Many of its variations have been studied including the Counting CSP, where the goal is to find the number of solutions to a CSP instance. The complexity of finding the exact number of solutions of a CSP is well understood (Bulatov, 2013, and Dyer and Richerby, 2013) and the focus has shifted to other variations of the Counting CSP such as counting the number of solutions modulo an integer. This problem has attracted considerable attention recently. In the case of CSPs based on undirected graphs Bulatov and Kazeminia (STOC 2022) obtained a complexity classification for the problem of counting solutions modulo p for arbitrary prime p. In this paper we report on the progress made towards a similar classification for the general CSP, not necessarily based on graphs.
  We identify several features that make the general case very different from the graph case such as a stronger form of rigidity and the structure of automorphisms of powers of relational structures. We provide a solution algorithm in the case p=2 that works under some additional conditions and prove the hardness of the problem under some assumptions about automorphisms of the powers of the relational structure. We also reduce the general CSP to the case that only uses binary relations satisfying strong additional conditions.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy theorem for $\Gamma$-switchable $H$-colouring on $m$-edge coloured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph in which each edge is assigned one of the colours $1, 2, \ldots, m$, and let $\Gamma$ be a subgroup of $S_m$. The operation of switching at a vertex $x$ of $G$ with respect to an element $\pi$ of $\Gamma$ permutes the colours of the edges incident with $x$ according to $\pi$. We investigate the complexity of whether there exists a sequence of switches that transforms a given $m$-edge coloured graph $G$ so that it has a colour-preserving homomorphism to a fixed $m$-edge coloured graph $H$ and give a dichotomy theorem in the case that $\Gamma$ acts transitively.</description>

      <title>A Complexity Map of Probabilistic Reasoning for Neurosymbolic Classification Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence is a growing field of research aiming to combine neural network learning capabilities with the reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. Informed multi-label classification is a sub-field of neurosymbolic AI which studies how to leverage prior knowledge to improve neural classification systems. Recently, a family of neurosymbolic techniques for informed classification based on probabilistic reasoning has gained significant traction. Unfortunately, depending on the language used to represent prior knowledge, solving certain probabilistic reasoning problems can become prohibitively hard when the number of classes increases. Therefore, the asymptotic complexity of probabilistic reasoning is of cardinal importance to assess the scalability of such techniques. In this paper, we develop a unified formalism for four probabilistic reasoning problems. Then, we compile several known and new tractability results into a single complexity map of probabilistic reasoning. We build on top of this complexity map to characterize the domains of scalability of several techniques. We hope this work will help neurosymbolic AI practitioners navigate the scalability landscape of probabilistic neurosymbolic techniques.</description>
