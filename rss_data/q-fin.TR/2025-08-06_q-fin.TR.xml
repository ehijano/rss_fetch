      <title>Measuring DEX Efficiency and The Effect of an Enhanced Routing Method on Both DEX Efficiency and Stakeholders' Benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the influence of token routing algorithms on market performance and stakeholder outcomes remain underexplored. This paper introduces the concept of Standardized Total Arbitrage Profit (STAP), computed via convex optimization, as a systematic measure of DEX efficiency. We prove that executing the trade order maximizing STAP and reintegrating the resulting transaction fees eliminates all arbitrage opportunities-both cyclic arbitrage within DEXs and between DEXs and centralized exchanges (CEXs). In a fully efficient DEX (i.e., STAP = 0), the monetary value of target tokens received must not exceed that of the source tokens, regardless of the routing algorithm. Any violation indicates arbitrage potential, making STAP a reliable metric for arbitrage detection. Using a token graph comprising 11 tokens and 18 liquidity pools based on Uniswap V2 data, we observe a decline in DEX efficiency between June 21 and November 8, 2024. Simulations comparing two routing algorithms-Yu Zhang et al.'s line-graph-based method and the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm-show that employing more profitable routing improves DEX efficiency and trader returns over time. Moreover, while total value locked (TVL) remains stable with the line-graph method, it increases under the DFS algorithm, indicating greater aggregate benefits for liquidity providers.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Classical and Quantum Models for DeFi Yield Prediction on Curve Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has created a growing demand for accurate yield and performance forecasting to guide liquidity allocation strategies. In this study, we benchmark six models, XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM, Transformer, quantum neural networks (QNN), and quantum support vector machines with quantum feature maps (QSVM-QNN), on one year of historical data from 28 Curve Finance pools. We evaluate model performance on test MAE, RMSE, and directional accuracy. Our results show that classical ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperform both deep learning and quantum models. XGBoost achieves the highest directional accuracy (71.57%) with a test MAE of 1.80, while Random Forest attains the lowest test MAE of 1.77 and 71.36% accuracy. In contrast, quantum models underperform with directional accuracy below 50% and higher errors, highlighting current limitations in applying quantum machine learning to real-world DeFi time series data. This work offers a reproducible benchmark and practical insights into model suitability for DeFi applications, emphasizing the robustness of classical methods over emerging quantum approaches in this domain.</description>

      <title>Modeling Loss-Versus-Rebalancing in Automated Market Makers via Continuous-Installment Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper mathematically models a constant-function automated market maker (CFAMM) position as a portfolio of exotic options, known as perpetual American continuous-installment (CI) options. This model replicates an AMM position's delta at each point in time over an infinite time horizon, thus taking into account the perpetual nature and optionality to withdraw of liquidity provision. This framework yields two key theoretical results: (a) It proves that the AMM's adverse-selection cost, loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR), is analytically identical to the continuous funding fees (the time value decay or theta) earned by the at-the-money CI option embedded in the replicating portfolio. (b) A special case of this model derives an AMM liquidity position's delta profile and boundaries that suffer approximately constant LVR, up to a bounded residual error, over an arbitrarily long forward window. Finally, the paper describes how the constant volatility parameter required by the perpetual option can be calibrated from the term structure of implied volatilities and estimates the errors for both implied volatility calibration and LVR residual error. Thus, this work provides a practical framework enabling liquidity providers to choose an AMM liquidity profile and price boundaries for an arbitrarily long, forward-looking time window where they can expect an approximately constant, price-independent LVR. The results establish a rigorous option-theoretic interpretation of AMMs and their LVR, and provide actionable guidance for liquidity providers in estimating future adverse-selection costs and optimizing position parameters.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Probabilistic Forest: Arbitrage in Prediction Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymarket is a prediction market platform where users can speculate on future events by trading shares tied to specific outcomes, known as conditions. Each market is associated with a set of one or more such conditions. To ensure proper market resolution, the condition set must be exhaustive -- collectively accounting for all possible outcomes -- and mutually exclusive -- only one condition may resolve as true. Thus, the collective prices of all related outcomes should be \$1, representing a combined probability of 1 of any outcome. Despite this design, Polymarket exhibits cases where dependent assets are mispriced, allowing for purchasing (or selling) a certain outcome for less than (or more than) \$1, guaranteeing profit. This phenomenon, known as arbitrage, could enable sophisticated participants to exploit such inconsistencies.
  In this paper, we conduct an empirical arbitrage analysis on Polymarket data to answer three key questions: (Q1) What conditions give rise to arbitrage (Q2) Does arbitrage actually occur on Polymarket and (Q3) Has anyone exploited these opportunities. A major challenge in analyzing arbitrage between related markets lies in the scalability of comparisons across a large number of markets and conditions, with a naive analysis requiring $O(2^{n+m})$ comparisons. To overcome this, we employ a heuristic-driven reduction strategy based on timeliness, topical similarity, and combinatorial relationships, further validated by expert input.
  Our study reveals two distinct forms of arbitrage on Polymarket: Market Rebalancing Arbitrage, which occurs within a single market or condition, and Combinatorial Arbitrage, which spans across multiple markets. We use on-chain historical order book data to analyze when these types of arbitrage opportunities have existed, and when they have been executed by users. We find a realized estimate of 40 million USD of profit extracted.</description>
