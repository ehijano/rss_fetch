      <title>Chiral Vibrational Modes in Small Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantitative methods for characterizing molecular chirality can provide an important tool for studying chirality induced phenomena in molecular systems. Significant progress has been made in recent years toward understanding the chirality of molecular normal vibrational modes, mostly focusing on vibrations of helical molecular structures. In the present study, we examine the applicability two methodologies previously used for helical structures for the quantification of the chirality of molecular normal modes across a range of small, not necessarily helical, molecules. The first approach involves the application of the Continuous Chirality Measure (CCM) to each normal mode by associating the mode with a structure formed by imposing the corresponding motion about a common origin. The second approach assigns to each normal mode a pseudoscalar defined as the product of atomic linear and angular momentum summed over all atoms. In particular, using the CCM also as a measure of the chirality of the underlying molecular structure, we establish the existence of correlation between the chirality of molecular normal modes and that of the underlying molecular structure. Furthermore, we find that normal modes associated with different frequency ranges of the molecular vibrational spectrum exhibit distinct handedness behavior.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent DFT-based study of bacteriochlorophyll a optical properties within the B800 part of Rhodoblastus acidophilus light-harvesting complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use time-dependent density functional theory-based approaches, TD-DFT and TD-DFTB, to investigate the optical absorption of B800 part of Rhodoblastus acidophilus light-harvesting complex 2 (LH2). Both methods are shown to give qualitative agreement with experimental spectra for a single BChl a molecule and for the optimized structure of B800 complex containing nine of such molecules. We proved the absence of any sizable effects originating from the interaction between adjacent molecules, thus optical features of B800 LH2 part should not be attributed to the structural organization of pigments. In addition, time-dependent procedure itself was found to be crucial for the correct description of BChl a absorption spectrum.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Mechanisms and Design Principles for Photodesorption from TiO${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photocatalytic reactions often exhibit fast kinetics and high product selectivity, qualities which are desirable but difficult to achieve simultaneously in thermally driven processes. However, photo-driven mechanisms are poorly understood owing to the difficulty in realistically modeling catalysts in optically excited states. Here we apply many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations to gain insight into these mechanisms by studying a prototypical photocatalytic reaction, proton desorption from a rutile TiO${}_2$ (110) surface. Our calculations reveal a qualitatively different desorption process upon photoexcitation, with an over 50% reduction in the desorption energy and the emergence of an energy barrier. We rationalize these findings with a generalizable model based on Fano theory and explain the surprising increase of excitonic effects as the proton detaches from the surface. Our model also yields a connection between how the alignment of relevant ionization potentials affects the shape of the excited-state potential energy surface. These results cannot be qualitatively captured by typical constrained density-functional theory and highlight how contemporary first-principles MBPT calculations can be applied to design photocatalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Polydispersity-driven dynamical differences between two- and three-dimensional supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have suggested a conundrum in the relaxation dynamics of polydisperse supercooled liquids. It has been shown that in two dimensions, the relative relaxation times of particles of different sizes become more similar as the material is cooled, whereas the opposite happens in three dimensions: they decouple. Here we resolve this conundrum. First, we show that the coupling observed in two dimensions is an artifact of cage correction introduced to account for Mermin-Wagner fluctuations. Instead, the relative relaxation time of small and large particles in two dimensions remains constant or slightly decouples with temperature, as opposed to the substantial decoupling observed in three dimensions. Investigating these dimensional differences further, we find through mobile cluster analysis that small particles initiate relaxation in both dimensions. As the clusters grow larger, they remain dominated by small particles in three dimensions whereas in two cluster growth becomes particle-size agnostic. We explain these findings with a minimal model by studying the distributions of single-particle barrier heights in the system, showing there is a clear difference in the environments of small and large particles, depending on the dimensionality. These findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in glass formation, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying the glass transition in polydisperse supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Exploring Dual-Iron Atomic Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Reduction: A Comprehensive Study on Structural and Electronic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), as an efficient and green pathway for ammonia synthesis, plays a crucial role in achieving on-demand ammonia production. This study proposes a novel design concept based on dual-iron atomic sites and nitrogen-boron co-doped graphene catalysts, exploring their high efficiency in NRR. By modulating the N and B co-doped ratios, we found that Fe2N3B@G catalyst exhibited significant activity in the adsorption and hydrogenation of N2 molecules, especially with the lowest free energy (0.32 eV) on NRR distal pathway, showing its excellent nitrogen activation capability and NRR performance. The computed electron localization function, crystal orbital Hamiltonian population, electrostatic potential map revealed that the improved NRR kinetics of Fe2N3B@G catalyst derived by N3B co-doping induced optimization of Fe-Fe electronic environment, regulation of Fe-N bond strength, and the continuous electronic support during the N2 breakage and hydrogenation. In particular, machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations were employed to verify the high activity of Fe2N3B@G catalyst in NRR, which reveal that Fe2N3B@G effectively regulates the electron density of Fe-N bond, ensuring the smooth generation and desorption of NH3 molecules and avoiding the competition with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, the determined higher HER overpotential of Fe2N3B@G catalyst can effectively inhibit the HER and enhance the selectivity toward NRR. In addition, Fe2N3B@G catalyst also showed good thermal stability by MD simulations up to 500 K, offering its feasibility in practical applications. This study demonstrates the superior performance of Fe2N3B@G in nitrogen reduction catalysis, and provides theoretical guidance for atomic catalyst design by the co-doping strategy and in-deep electronic environment modulation.</description>

      <title>New routes for PN destruction and formation in the ISM via neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions and an extended database for reactions involving phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03635</link>

Abstract: Phosphorus plays an essential role in the chemistry of living organisms, being present in several fundamental biomolecules. The investigation of chemical reactions taking place in different astronomical environments involving phosphorus-containing molecules is essential for understanding how these species are produced and destroyed. Phosphorus monoxide (PO) and phosphorus nitride (PN) are key reservoirs of phosphorus in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). This work presents a computational study of the CPN system to identify viable reaction pathways involving atom-diatom collisions and to explore a potential destruction route for PN in the ISM. We explore the potential energy landscape of the C($\mathrm{^3P}$) + PN($^1\Sigma^+$), N($\mathrm{^4S}$) + CP($^2\Sigma^+$) and P($\mathrm{^4S}$) + CN($^2\Sigma^+$) reactions by performing high-accuracy ab initio calculations and provide their rate coefficients over a wide range of temperatures. The temperature-dependent rate coefficients were fitted to the modified Arrhenius equation: $k(T)=\alpha(T/300)^{\beta}\mathrm{exp}(-\gamma/T)$. An updated chemical network for P-bearing species was used to model the time-dependent abundances and reaction contributions of P, PO, PN, and PH during the chemical evolution of diffuse/translucent and dense clouds. The only neutral-neutral reaction capable of destroying PN without an activation energy seems to be the PN+C one. We have also shown that reactions between CP and N can yield CN and PN barrierless. Chemical models indicate that PO is a crucial species driving the gas-phase formation of PN. Typically, PO/PN ratios exceed 1, though their chemistry is influenced by photon- and cosmic-ray-induced processes. Over time in simulated dense clouds, neutral-neutral reactions such as PO + N, PH + N, P + OH, and PH + O play a significant role in determining the relative abundances of PO and PN.</description>

      <title>Complete Active Space Iterative Coupled Cluster Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility of improving multireference-driven coupled cluster (CC) approaches with an algorithm that iteratively combines complete active space (CAS) calculations with tailored CC and externally corrected CC. This is accomplished by establishing a feedback loop between the CC and CAS parts of a calculation through similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian with those CC amplitudes that are not encompassed by the active space. We denote this approach the complete active space iterative coupled cluster (CASiCC) ansatz. We investigate its efficiency and accuracy in the singles and doubles approximation by studying the prototypical molecules H4, H8, H2O, and N2. Our results demonstrate that CASiCC systematically improves on the single-reference CCSD and the ecCCSD methods across entire potential energy curves, while retaining modest computational costs. However, the tailored coupled cluster method shows superior performance in the strong correlation regime suggesting that its accuracy is based on error compensation. We find that the iterative version of externally corrected and tailored coupled cluster methods converge to the same results.</description>

      <title>Chemical Continuous Time Random Walks under Anomalous Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical master equation plays an important role to describe the time evolution of homogeneous chemical system. In addition to the reaction process, it is also accompanied by physical diffusion of the reactants in complex system that is generally not homogeneous, which will result in non-exponential waiting times for particle reactions and diffusion. In this paper we shall introduce a chemical continuous time random walk under anomalous diffusion model based on renewal process to describe the general reaction-diffusion process in the heterogeneous system, where the waiting times are arbitrary distributed. According to this model, we will develop the systematic stochastic theory including generalizing the chemical diffusion master equation, deriving the corresponding mass action law, and extending the Gillespie algorithm. As an example, we analyze the monomolecular $A\leftrightarrow B$ reaction-diffusion system for exponential and power-law waiting times respectively, and show the strong fractional memory effect of the concentration of the reactants on the history of the concentration in power-law case.</description>

      <title>Relevant, hidden, and frustrated information in high-dimensional analyses of complex dynamical systems with internal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09412v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting from trajectory data meaningful information to understand complex molecular systems might be non-trivial. High-dimensional analyses are typically assumed to be desirable, if not required, to prevent losing important information. But to what extent such high-dimensionality is really needed/beneficial often remains unclear. Here we challenge such a fundamental general problem. As a representative case of a system with internal dynamical complexity, we study atomistic molecular dynamics trajectories of liquid water and ice coexisting in dynamical equilibrium at the solid/liquid transition temperature. To attain an intrinsically high-dimensional analysis, we use as an example the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor, obtaining a large dataset containing 2.56e6 576-dimensional SOAP vectors that we analyze in various ways. Our results demonstrate how the time-series data contained in one single SOAP dimension accounting only &lt;0.001% of the total dataset's variance (neglected and discarded in typical variance-based dimensionality-reduction approaches) allows resolving a remarkable amount of information, classifying/discriminating the bulk of water and ice phases, as well as two solid-interface and liquid-interface layers as four statistically distinct dynamical molecular environments. Adding more dimensions to this one is found not only ineffective but even detrimental to the analysis due to recurrent negligible-information/non-negligible-noise additions and "frustrated information" phenomena leading to information loss. Such effects are proven general and are observed also in completely different systems and descriptors' combinations. This shows how high-dimensional analyses are not necessarily better than low-dimensional ones to elucidate the internal complexity of physical/chemical systems, especially when these are characterized by non-negligible internal noise.</description>

      <title>Molecular details and free energy barriers of ion de-coordination at elevated salinity and pressure and their consequences for membrane separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ion dehydration has been hypothesized to strongly influence separation performance in membrane systems and ion transport in nanoscale channels. However, the molecular details of ion dehydration in membranes are not well understood, in particular under the high pressures and concentrations required for brine treatment. In this study, we define \textit{de-coordination} as the process by which an ion decreases its total coordination number, including both water molecules and counterions. We estimate the de-coordination free energies in bulk solution for a range of different ions at high pressure and salinity relevant to brine treatment using molecular simulation. We also propose alternatives to the coordination number as the size constraint for traversing nanoscale constrictions, such as the maximum cross-sectional area of the complexed ion. We show that high operating pressures do not significantly change cation hydration shell stability nor the shell size, while high ionic concentrations lower the free energy barrier to reduce the cation coordination number. We find that anion de-coordination free energies are largely unaffected by elevated salinity and pressure conditions. Finally, we discuss the implications on ion-ion selectivity in separations membranes (e.g. extracting lithium from salt-lake brines) due to the effects of elevated pressure and salinity on ion de-coordination.</description>
