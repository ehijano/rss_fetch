      <title>Holographic Parallax Improves 3D Perceptual Realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays are a promising technology to solve long-standing challenges in virtual and augmented reality display systems. Over the last few years, many different computer-generated holography (CGH) algorithms have been proposed that are supervised by different types of target content, such as 2.5D RGB-depth maps, 3D focal stacks, and 4D light fields. It is unclear, however, what the perceptual implications are of the choice of algorithm and target content type. In this work, we build a perceptual testbed of a full-color, high-quality holographic near-eye display. Under natural viewing conditions, we examine the effects of various CGH supervision formats and conduct user studies to assess their perceptual impacts on 3D realism. Our results indicate that CGH algorithms designed for specific viewpoints exhibit noticeable deficiencies in achieving 3D realism. In contrast, holograms incorporating parallax cues consistently outperform other formats across different viewing conditions, including the center of the eyebox. This finding is particularly interesting and suggests that the inclusion of parallax cues in CGH rendering plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall quality of the holographic experience. This work represents an initial stride towards delivering a perceptually realistic 3D experience with holographic near-eye displays.</description>

      <title>Rendering Participating Media Using Path Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rendering volumetric scattering media, including clouds, fog, smoke, and other complex materials, is crucial for realism in computer graphics. Traditional path tracing, while unbiased, requires many long path samples to converge in scenes with scattering media, and a lot of work is wasted by paths that make a negligible contribution to the image. Methods to make better use of the information learned during path tracing range from photon mapping to radiance caching, but struggle to support the full range of heterogeneous scattering media. This paper introduces a new volumetric rendering algorithm that extends and adapts the previous \emph{path graph} surface rendering algorithm. Our method leverages the information collected through multiple-scattering transport paths to compute lower-noise estimates, increasing computational efficiency by reducing the required sample count. Our key contributions include an extended path graph for participating media and new aggregation and propagation operators for efficient path reuse in volumes. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly boosts convergence in scenes with challenging volumetric light transport, including heterogeneous media with high scattering albedos and dense, forward-scattering translucent materials, under complex lighting conditions.</description>

      <title>Cicero: Addressing Algorithmic and Architectural Bottlenecks in Neural Rendering by Radiance Warping and Memory Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is widely seen as an alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. However, NeRF has not yet seen its adoption in resource-limited mobile systems such as Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), because it is simply extremely slow. On a mobile Volta GPU, even the state-of-the-art NeRF models generally execute only at 0.8 FPS. We show that the main performance bottlenecks are both algorithmic and architectural. We introduce, CICERO, to tame both forms of inefficiencies. We first introduce two algorithms, one fundamentally reduces the amount of work any NeRF model has to execute, and the other eliminates irregular DRAM accesses. We then describe an on-chip data layout strategy that eliminates SRAM bank conflicts. A pure software implementation of CICERO offers an 8.0x speed-up and 7.9x energy saving over a mobile Volta GPU. When compared to a baseline with a dedicated DNN accelerator, our speed-up and energy reduction increase to 28.2x and 37.8x, respectively - all with minimal quality loss (less than 1.0 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio reduction).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a MusIc conditioned 3D Dance GEneraTion model, named MIDGET based on Dance motion Vector Quantised Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) model and Motion Generative Pre-Training (GPT) model to generate vibrant and highquality dances that match the music rhythm. To tackle challenges in the field, we introduce three new components: 1) a pre-trained memory codebook based on the Motion VQ-VAE model to store different human pose codes, 2) employing Motion GPT model to generate pose codes with music and motion Encoders, 3) a simple framework for music feature extraction. We compare with existing state-of-the-art models and perform ablation experiments on AIST++, the largest publicly available music-dance dataset. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on motion quality and its alignment with the music.</description>

      <title>S3R-Net: A Single-Stage Approach to Self-Supervised Shadow Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present S3R-Net, the Self-Supervised Shadow Removal Network. The two-branch WGAN model achieves self-supervision relying on the unify-and-adaptphenomenon - it unifies the style of the output data and infers its characteristics from a database of unaligned shadow-free reference images. This approach stands in contrast to the large body of supervised frameworks. S3R-Net also differentiates itself from the few existing self-supervised models operating in a cycle-consistent manner, as it is a non-cyclic, unidirectional solution. The proposed framework achieves comparable numerical scores to recent selfsupervised shadow removal models while exhibiting superior qualitative performance and keeping the computational cost low.</description>

      <title>AniClipart: Clipart Animation with Text-to-Video Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clipart, a pre-made graphic art form, offers a convenient and efficient way of illustrating visual content. Traditional workflows to convert static clipart images into motion sequences are laborious and time-consuming, involving numerous intricate steps like rigging, key animation and in-betweening. Recent advancements in text-to-video generation hold great potential in resolving this problem. Nevertheless, direct application of text-to-video generation models often struggles to retain the visual identity of clipart images or generate cartoon-style motions, resulting in unsatisfactory animation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce AniClipart, a system that transforms static clipart images into high-quality motion sequences guided by text-to-video priors. To generate cartoon-style and smooth motion, we first define B\'{e}zier curves over keypoints of the clipart image as a form of motion regularization. We then align the motion trajectories of the keypoints with the provided text prompt by optimizing the Video Score Distillation Sampling (VSDS) loss, which encodes adequate knowledge of natural motion within a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model. With a differentiable As-Rigid-As-Possible shape deformation algorithm, our method can be end-to-end optimized while maintaining deformation rigidity. Experimental results show that the proposed AniClipart consistently outperforms existing image-to-video generation models, in terms of text-video alignment, visual identity preservation, and motion consistency. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of AniClipart by adapting it to generate a broader array of animation formats, such as layered animation, which allows topological changes.</description>

      <title>Inverse Neural Rendering for Explainable Multi-Object Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, most methods for image understanding tasks rely on feed-forward neural networks. While this approach has allowed for empirical accuracy, efficiency, and task adaptation via fine-tuning, it also comes with fundamental disadvantages. Existing networks often struggle to generalize across different datasets, even on the same task. By design, these networks ultimately reason about high-dimensional scene features, which are challenging to analyze. This is true especially when attempting to predict 3D information based on 2D images. We propose to recast 3D multi-object tracking from RGB cameras as an \emph{Inverse Rendering (IR)} problem, by optimizing via a differentiable rendering pipeline over the latent space of pre-trained 3D object representations and retrieve the latents that best represent object instances in a given input image. To this end, we optimize an image loss over generative latent spaces that inherently disentangle shape and appearance properties. We investigate not only an alternate take on tracking but our method also enables examining the generated objects, reasoning about failure situations, and resolving ambiguous cases. We validate the generalization and scaling capabilities of our method by learning the generative prior exclusively from synthetic data and assessing camera-based 3D tracking on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. Both these datasets are completely unseen to our method and do not require fine-tuning. Videos and code are available at https://light.princeton.edu/inverse-rendering-tracking/.</description>

      <title>Lazy Diffusion Transformer for Interactive Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel diffusion transformer, LazyDiffusion, that generates partial image updates efficiently. Our approach targets interactive image editing applications in which, starting from a blank canvas or an image, a user specifies a sequence of localized image modifications using binary masks and text prompts. Our generator operates in two phases. First, a context encoder processes the current canvas and user mask to produce a compact global context tailored to the region to generate. Second, conditioned on this context, a diffusion-based transformer decoder synthesizes the masked pixels in a "lazy" fashion, i.e., it only generates the masked region. This contrasts with previous works that either regenerate the full canvas, wasting time and computation, or confine processing to a tight rectangular crop around the mask, ignoring the global image context altogether. Our decoder's runtime scales with the mask size, which is typically small, while our encoder introduces negligible overhead. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art inpainting methods in terms of quality and fidelity while providing a 10x speedup for typical user interactions, where the editing mask represents 10% of the image.</description>

      <title>MeshLRM: Large Reconstruction Model for High-Quality Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose MeshLRM, a novel LRM-based approach that can reconstruct a high-quality mesh from merely four input images in less than one second. Different from previous large reconstruction models (LRMs) that focus on NeRF-based reconstruction, MeshLRM incorporates differentiable mesh extraction and rendering within the LRM framework. This allows for end-to-end mesh reconstruction by fine-tuning a pre-trained NeRF LRM with mesh rendering. Moreover, we improve the LRM architecture by simplifying several complex designs in previous LRMs. MeshLRM's NeRF initialization is sequentially trained with low- and high-resolution images; this new LRM training strategy enables significantly faster convergence and thereby leads to better quality with less compute. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction from sparse-view inputs and also allows for many downstream applications, including text-to-3D and single-image-to-3D generation.

      <title>On the Content Bias in Fr\'echet Video Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), a prominent metric for evaluating video generation models, is known to conflict with human perception occasionally. In this paper, we aim to explore the extent of FVD's bias toward per-frame quality over temporal realism and identify its sources. We first quantify the FVD's sensitivity to the temporal axis by decoupling the frame and motion quality and find that the FVD increases only slightly with large temporal corruption. We then analyze the generated videos and show that via careful sampling from a large set of generated videos that do not contain motions, one can drastically decrease FVD without improving the temporal quality. Both studies suggest FVD's bias towards the quality of individual frames. We further observe that the bias can be attributed to the features extracted from a supervised video classifier trained on the content-biased dataset. We show that FVD with features extracted from the recent large-scale self-supervised video models is less biased toward image quality. Finally, we revisit a few real-world examples to validate our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>DualFluidNet: an Attention-based Dual-pipeline Network for FLuid Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid motion can be considered as a point cloud transformation when using the SPH method. Compared to traditional numerical analysis methods, using machine learning techniques to learn physics simulations can achieve near-accurate results, while significantly increasing efficiency. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for 3D fluid simulations utilizing an Attention-based Dual-pipeline Network, which employs a dual-pipeline architecture, seamlessly integrated with an Attention-based Feature Fusion Module. Unlike previous methods, which often make difficult trade-offs between global fluid control and physical law constraints, we find a way to achieve a better balance between these two crucial aspects with a well-designed dual-pipeline approach. Additionally, we design a Type-aware Input Module to adaptively recognize particles of different types and perform feature fusion afterward, such that fluid-solid coupling issues can be better dealt with. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset, Tank3D, to further explore the network's ability to handle more complicated scenes. The experiments demonstrate that our approach not only attains a quantitative enhancement in various metrics, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods but also signifies a qualitative leap in neural network-based simulation by faithfully adhering to the physical laws.
