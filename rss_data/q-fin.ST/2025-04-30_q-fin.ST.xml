      <title>Predictive AI with External Knowledge Infusion for Stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations in stock prices are influenced by a complex interplay of factors that go beyond mere historical data. These factors, themselves influenced by external forces, encompass inter-stock dynamics, broader economic factors, various government policy decisions, outbreaks of wars, etc. Furthermore, all of these factors are dynamic and exhibit changes over time. In this paper, for the first time, we tackle the forecasting problem under external influence by proposing learning mechanisms that not only learn from historical trends but also incorporate external knowledge from temporal knowledge graphs. Since there are no such datasets or temporal knowledge graphs available, we study this problem with stock market data, and we construct comprehensive temporal knowledge graph datasets. In our proposed approach, we model relations on external temporal knowledge graphs as events of a Hawkes process on graphs. With extensive experiments, we show that learned dynamic representations effectively rank stocks based on returns across multiple holding periods, outperforming related baselines on relevant metrics.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning vs. Black-Scholes: Option Pricing Performance on Brazilian Petrobras Stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of deep residual networks for pricing European options on Petrobras, one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, and compares its performance with the Black-Scholes (BS) model. Using eight years of historical data from B3 (Brazilian Stock Exchange) collected via web scraping, a deep learning model was trained using a custom built hybrid loss function that incorporates market data and analytical pricing. The data for training and testing were drawn between the period spanning November 2016 to January 2025, using an 80-20 train-test split. The test set consisted of data from the final three months: November, December, and January 2025. The deep residual network model achieved a 64.3\% reduction in the mean absolute error for the 3-19 BRL (Brazilian Real) range when compared to the Black-Scholes model on the test set. Furthermore, unlike the Black-Scholes solution, which tends to decrease its accuracy for longer periods of time, the deep learning model performed accurately for longer expiration periods. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning in financial modeling, with future work focusing on specialized models for different price ranges.</description>

      <title>Compounding Effects in Leveraged ETFs: Beyond the Volatility Drag Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common belief is that leveraged ETFs (LETFs) suffer long-term performance decay due to \emph{volatility drag}. We show that this view is incomplete: LETF performance depends fundamentally on return autocorrelation and return dynamics. In markets with independent returns, LETFs exhibit positive expected compounding effects on their target multiples. In serially correlated markets, trends enhance returns, while mean reversion induces underperformance. With a unified framework incorporating AR(1) and AR-GARCH models, continuous-time regime switching, and flexible rebalancing frequencies, we demonstrate that return dynamics -- including return autocorrelation, volatility clustering, and regime persistence -- determine whether LETFs outperform or underperform their targets. Empirically, using about 20 years of SPDR S\&amp;P~500 ETF and Nasdaq-100 ETF data, we confirm these theoretical predictions. Daily-rebalanced LETFs enhance returns in momentum-driven markets, whereas infrequent rebalancing mitigates losses in mean-reverting regimes.</description>

      <title>Scaling and shape of financial returns distributions modeled as conditionally independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that assuming that the returns are independent when conditioned on the value of their variance (volatility), which itself varies in time randomly, then the distribution of returns is well described by the statistics of the sum of conditionally independent random variables. In particular, we show that the distribution of returns can be cast in a simple scaling form, and that its functional form is directly related to the distribution of the volatilities. This approach explains the presence of power-law tails in the returns as a direct consequence of the presence of a power law tail in the distribution of volatilities. It also provides the form of the distribution of Bitcoin returns, which behaves as a stretched exponential, as a consequence of the fact that the Bitcoin volatilities distribution is also closely described by a stretched exponential. We test our predictions with data from the S\&amp;P 500 index, Apple and Paramount stocks; and Bitcoin.</description>

      <title>Financial Data Analysis with Robust Federated Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the analysis of financial data in a federated setting, wherein data is distributed across multiple clients or locations, and the raw data never leaves the local devices. Our primary focus is not only on the development of efficient learning frameworks (for protecting user data privacy) in the field of federated learning but also on the importance of designing models that are easier to interpret. In addition, we care about the robustness of the framework to outliers. To achieve these goals, we propose a robust federated logistic regression-based framework that strives to strike a balance between these goals. To verify the feasibility of our proposed framework, we carefully evaluate its performance not only on independently identically distributed (IID) data but also on non-IID data, especially in scenarios involving outliers. Extensive numerical results collected from multiple public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve comparable performance to those of classical centralized algorithms, such as Logistical Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.</description>
