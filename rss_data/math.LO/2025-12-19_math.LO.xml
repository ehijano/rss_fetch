      <title>Projective Determinacy and Generic Absoluteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic absoluteness refers to the stability of the set-theoretic universe under forcing expansions. A result by Kripke asserts that every complete Boolean algebra can be completely embedded into a countably generated one. In terms of forcing, this means that every forcing expansion of the universe is contained in one derived by a collapse forcing. The central question of this article is whether some level of generic absoluteness for collapse forcings is equivalent to the same kind of absoluteness for any forcing notion. We solve this question affirmatively under natural determinacy hypotheses, which follow from the existence of large cardinals. The long proof, which combines many set-theoretic techniques, estabilishing new connections within the field. For instance, we generalise the famous proof of Projective Determinacy by Martin and Steel to the context of homogeneity relative to an inner model, as well as giving a new proof of Neeman's optimal Projective Determinacy result.</description>

      <title>(Pointed) Univalence in Universe Category Models of Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a formulation of the univalence axiom in a universe category model of dependent type theory that is convenient to verify in homotopy-theoretic settings. We further develop a strengthening of the univalence axiom, called pointed univalence, that is both computationally desirable and semantically natural, and verify its closure under Artin-Wraith gluing and formation of inverse diagrams.</description>

      <title>Weyl's Quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08562v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I argue against the predominant view of Weyl's interpretation of the logical signs. Drawing on his correctness-first account of mathematical knowledge, I point out that, according to him, quantified statements generate conditional obligations to act in ways that expand the repository of correct judgments. This clarifies Weyl's reasons for rejecting the law of excluded middle, which have nothing to do with what has been attributed to him by the predominant view. I also offer some preliminary thoughts on how to understand conditional obligations generated by statements with nested quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Borel liftings in complex analysis and PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish Borel equivariant analogues of several classical theorems from complex analysis and PDE. The starting point is an equivariant Weierstrass theorem for entire functions: there exists a Borel mapping which assigns to each non-periodic positive divisor $d$ an entire function $f_d$ with divisor of zeros $\mathrm{div}(f_d)=d$ and which commutes with translation, $f_{d-w}(z)=f_d(z+w)$. We also examine the existence of equivariant Borel right inverses for the distributional Laplacian, the heat operator, and the $\bar{\partial}$-operator on the space of smooth functions. We demonstrate that Borel equivariant inverses for these maps exist on the free part of the range. In general, the freeness assumptions cannot be omitted and Borelness cannot be strengthened to continuity. Our positive results follow from a theorem establishing sufficient conditions for the existence of equivariant Borel liftings. Two key ingredients are Runge-type approximation theorems and the existence of Borel toasts, which are Borel analogues of Rokhlin towers from ergodic theory.</description>

      <title>Advancing mathematics research with generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI models for advanced mathematics is that these models are not primarily logical reasoning engines. However, Large Language Models, and their refinements, can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of generative AI models to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how generative AI models can be used to advance mathematics research. We also discuss their integration with neuro-symbolic solvers, Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.</description>
