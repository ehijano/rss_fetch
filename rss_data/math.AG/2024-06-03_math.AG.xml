      <description>arXiv:2406.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we build bridges between moduli theory of sheaf stable pairs on one hand and birational geometry on the other hand. We will in particular treat moduli of sheaf stable pairs on smooth projective curves in detail and present some calculations in low degrees. We will also outline problems in various directions.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic symplectic manifolds from semistable Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{C}(2, 0)$ be the moduli space of semistable rank two and degree zero Higgs bundles on a smooth complex hyperelliptic curve $C$ of genus three. We prove that the quotient of $\mathcal{M}_{C}(2, 0)$ by a twisted version of the hyperelliptic involution is an 18-dimensional holomorphic symplectic variety admitting a crepant resolution, whose local model was studied by Kaledin and Lehn to describe O'Grady's singularities. Similarly, by considering the moduli space of Higgs bundles with trivial determinant $\mathcal{M}_C(2, \mathcal{O}_{C})\subseteq \mathcal{M}_C(2, 0)$, we show that the quotient of $\mathcal{M}_C(2, \mathcal{O}_{C})$ by the hyperelliptic involution is a 12-dimensional holomorphic symplectic variety admitting a crepant resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud structure theorem for a minimal free resolution of an arithmetically Gorenstein variety, we describe a structure theorem for the highest linear syzygies among quadrics defining a del Pezzo variety. Indeed, such syzygies can be represented as columns of a skew-symmetric matrix whose entries are wedge products of linear forms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question whether a real threefold X fibred into quadric surfaces over the real projective line is stably rational (over R) if the topological space X(R) is connected. We give a counterexample. When all geometric fibres are irreducible, the question is open. We investigate a family of such fibrations for which the intermediate jacobian technique is not available. We produce two independent methods which in many cases enable one to prove decomposition of the diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ be a finite subgroup. We introduce a class of projective noncommutative surfaces $\mathbb{P}^2_I$, indexed by a set of irreducible $\Gamma$-representations. When considering the extended action of $\Gamma$ from $\mathbb{C}^2$ to $\mathbb{P}^2$, we show that these surfaces generalise both $[\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma]$ and $\mathbb{P}^2/\Gamma$. We prove that isomorphism classes of framed torsion-free sheaves on any $\mathbb{P}^2_I$ carry a canonical bijection to the closed points of appropriate Nakajima quiver varieties. In particular, we provide geometric interpretations for a class of Nakajima quiver varieties using noncommutative geometry. Our results partially generalise several previous results on such quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>On the variety of tritangential planes to a general K3 surface of degree 6 and genus 4 in $\mP^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S\subset \mP^4$ be a general K3 surface of degree 6 and genus 4. In this paper we study the irreducible variety $X_S$ of \emph{tritangential planes} to $S$ whose general point is a plane that intersects $S$ in a curvilinear scheme of length six supported at three non collinear points. The variety $X_S$ can be identified as the relevant part of the fixed locus of the so called \emph{Beauville involution} defined on the Hilbert scheme $S[3]$ of 0--dimensional schemes of length three of $S$. In this paper we prove that: (a) $X_S$ has dimension 3, is irreducible and smooth, except for 210 points that are at most of multiplicity 2 for $X_S$; (b) $X_S$, in its natural embedding in the Grassmannian $\mathbb G(2,4)\subset \mP^9$ of planes in $\mP^4$, has degree $152$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complex projective algebraic variety $X$ we define $ h(X)$ as the largest $n$ such that the $n$-th symmetric power of $X$ is (Brody) hyperbolic. Using Nevanlinna theory for algebroid maps, we give non-trivial lower bounds for $ h(X)$. From an arithmetic point of view, the problem is closely related to the finiteness of algebraic points of bounded degree in varieties over number fields. We provide explicit applications of our results in the case of curves embedded in surfaces and in the case of subvarieties of abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Relations in Twisted Quantum K-Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce twisted quantum $K$-rings, defined via twisted $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. We develop a toolkit for computing relations by adapting some results about ordinary quantum K rings to our setting, and discuss some applications, including Ruan-Zhang's quantum $K$-theory with level structure, and complete intersections inside projective space, confirming some predictions coming from physics.
  In addition, we formulate a ring-theoretic abelian/non-abelian correspondence conjecture, relating the quantum K-ring of a GIT quotient $X//G$ to a certain twist of the quantum K-ring of $X//T$, the quotient by the maximal torus. We prove this conjecture for the case of Grassmanians, and use this to give another proof of the Whitney relations of Mihalcea-Gu-Sharpe-Zhou.</description>

      <title>The Waldschmidt constant of special fat flat subschemes in $\mathbb{P}^N$]{The Waldschmidt constant of special fat flat subschemes in $\mathbb{P}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to construct some special kind of subschemes in $\mathbb{P}^N$ with $ N\ge 3$, which we call them "fat flat subschemes" and compute their Waldschmidt constants. These subschemes are constructed by adding, in a particular way, a finite number of linear subspaces of $\mathbb{P}^N$ of many different dimensions to a star configuration in $\mathbb{P}^N$, with arbitrary preassigned multiplicities to each one of these linear subspaces, as well as the star configuration. Among other things, it will be shown that for every positive integer $d$, there are infinitely many fat flat subschemes in $\mathbb{P}^N$ with the Waldschmidt constant equal to $d$. In addition to this, for any two integers $1\le a&lt;b$, we also construct a fat flat subscheme of the above type in some projective space $\mathbb{P}^M$, which its Waldschmidt constant is equal to $b/a$. In addition to these, all non-reduced fat points subschemes $Z$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ with the Waldschmidt constants less than $5/2$ are classified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of positive characteristic $p$, and $X$ be a separated of finite type $k$-scheme of dimension $d$. We construct a cycle map from the additive cycle complex to the residual complex of Serre-Grothendieck coherent duality theory. This map is compatible with a cubical version of the map constructed in [Ren23] arXiv:2104.09662 when $k$ is perfect. As a corollary, we get injectivity statements for (additive) higher Chow groups as well as for motivic cohomology (with modulus) with $\mathbb{Z}/p$ coefficients when $k$ is algebraically closed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we consider a class of $q$-hypergeometric equations describing the quantum difference equation for the cotangent bundle over projective space $X=T^{*}\mathbb{P}^n$ . We show that over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ these equations are equipped with the Frobenius action $z\to z^p$. We obtain an explicit formula for the constant term of the Frobenius intertwiner in therms of $p$-adic $q$-gamma function of Koblitz. In the limit $q\to 1$ our formula degenerates to the Frobenius intertwiners for the hypergeometric differential equations discovered by B.Dwork.</description>

Abstract: Soprunov and Soprunova introduced the notion of a good infinite family of toric codes. We prove that such good families do not exist by proving a more general Szemer\'edi-type result: for all $c\in(0,1]$ and all positive integers $N$, subsets of density at least $c$ in $\{0,1,\dots,N-1\}^n$ contain hypercubes of arbitrarily large dimension as $n$ grows.</description>

      <title>Cokernels of the Euler restriction map of logarithmic derivation modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two restriction maps of the logarithmic modules of plane arrangements in a three dimensional vector space. One is the Euler restriction and the other is the Ziegler restriction. The dimension of the cokernel of the Ziegler restriction map of logarithmic derivation modules has been well-studied for the freeness of hyperplane arrangements after Yoshinaga's celebrated criterion for freeness, which connects the second Betti number and the splitting type (exponents). However, though the Euler restriction has a longer history than the Ziegler restriction, the cokernel and its dimension of the Euler restriction have not been studied at all.
  The aim of this article is to study the cokernel and dimension of the Euler restriction maps in terms of combinatorics, more explicitly, the characteristic polynomial. We give an upper bound of that cokernel, and show the formula for that if the arrangement is free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by chern classes of tautological bundles. The expression is the result of twisting a well known generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. This gives an explicit description of the rational function the capped vertex is an expansion of. Along the way we prove various limit expressions of the capping operator and the bare vertex function.</description>

As an application, we prove that if $R$ is a normal domain essentially of finite type over a field, there exists a constant $C$ so that for all prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathfrak{q}\in\mbox{Spec}(R)$, if $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathfrak{q}^{(t)}$, then for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there is a containment of symbolic powers $\mathfrak{p}^{(Cn)}\subseteq \mathfrak{q}^{(tn)}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a uniform estimate of the number of points for difference algebraic varieties in finite difference fields in the spirit of Lang-Weil. More precisely, we give uniform lower and upper bounds for the number of rational points of a difference variety in terms of its transformal dimension. As a main technical ingredient, we prove an equidimensionality result for Frobenius reductions of difference varieties.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Quantum Toroidal Algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}), Vertex Operators and L-operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new vertex operators, both the type I and the type II dual, of the elliptic quantum toroidal algebra U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) by combining representations of U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor}) and the notions of the elliptic stable envelopes for the instanton moduli space M(n,r). The vertex operators reproduce the shuffle product formula of the elliptic stable envelopes by their composition. We also show that the vacuum expectation value of a composition of the vertex operators gives a correct formula of the K-theoretic vertex function for M(n,r). We then derive exchange relations among the vertex operators and construct a L-operator satisfying the RLL=LLR^* relation with R and R^* being elliptic dynamical instanton R-matrices defined as transition matrices of the elliptic stable envelopes. Assuming a universal form of L, we define a comultiplication \Delta in terms of it. It turns out that the new vertex operators are intertwining operators of the U_{t_1,t_2,p}(gl_{1,tor})-modules w.r.t \Delta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider arithmetic analogs of the relative Langlands program and applications of new non-reductive geometry. Firstly, we introduce mirabolic special cycles, which produce special cycles on many Hodge type Rapoport-Zink spaces via pullbacks e.g. Kudla--Rapoport cycles. Secondly, we formulate arithmetic intersection problems for these cycles and formulate a method of arithmetic induction. As a main example, we formulate arithmetic twisted Gan--Gross--Prasad conjectures on unitary Shimura varieties and prove a key twisted arithmetic fundamental lemma using mirabolic special cycles, arithmetic inductions, and Weil type relative trace formulas.</description>

      <title>Patching and multiplicities of p-adic eigenforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of non-classical $p$-adic automorphic eigenforms associated to a classical system of eigenvalues on definite unitary groups in $3$ variables. These eigenforms are associated to Galois representations which are crystalline but very critical at $p$. We use patching techniques related to the trianguline variety of local Galois representations and its local model. The new input is a comparison of the coherent sheaves appearing in the patching process with coherent sheaves on the Grothendieck--Springer version of the Steinberg variety given by a functor constructed by Bezrukavnikov.</description>

      <title>Link Bundles and Intersection Spaces of Complex Toric Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist several homology theories for singular spaces that satisfy generalized Poincar\'e duality, including Goresky-MacPherson's intersection homology, Cheeger's $L^2$ cohomology and the homology of intersection spaces. The intersection homology and $L^2$ cohomology of toric varieties is known. Here, we compute the rational homology of intersection spaces of complex 3-dimensional toric varieties and compare it to intersection homology. To achieve this, we analyze cell structures and topological stratifications of these varieties and determine compatible structures on their singularity links. In particular, we compute the homology of links in 3-dimensional toric varieties. We find it convenient to use the concept of a rational homology stratification. It turns out that the intersection space homology of a toric variety, contrary to its intersection homology, is not combinatorially invariant and thus retains more refined information on the defining fan.</description>

      <title>Homological mirror symmetry for hypertoric varieties II (with an Appendix written jointly with Laurent C\^ot\'e and Justin Hilburn)</title>

      <description>arXiv:1903.07928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a homological mirror symmetry equivalence for pairs of multiplicative hypertoric varieties, and we calculate monodromy autoequivalences of these categories by promoting our result to an equivalence of perverse schobers. We prove our equivalence by matching holomorphic Lagrangian skeleta, on the A-model side, with non-commutative resolutions on the B-model side. The hyperk\"ahler geometry of these spaces provides each category with a natural t-structure, which helps clarify SYZ duality in a hyperk\"ahler context. Our results are a prototype for mirror symmetry statements relating pairs of K-theoretic Coulomb branches.</description>

      <title>Higher Koszul brackets on the cotangent complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.04204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 1$ and $A$ be a commutative algebra of the form $\boldsymbol k[x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n]/I$ where $\boldsymbol k$ is a field of characteristic $0$ and $I\subseteq \boldsymbol k[x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n]$ is an ideal. Assume that there is a Poisson bracket $\{\:,\:\}$ on $S$ such that $\{I,S\}\subseteq I$ and let us denote the induced bracket on $A$ by $\{\:,\:\}$ as well. It is well-known that $[\mathrm d x_i,\mathrm d x_j]:=\mathrm d\{x_i,x_j\}$ defines a Lie bracket on the $A$-module $\Omega_{A|\boldsymbol k}$ of K\"ahler differentials making $(A,\Omega_{A|\boldsymbol k})$ a Lie-Rinehart pair. Recall that $A$ is regular if and only if $\Omega_{A|\boldsymbol k}$ is projective as an $A$-module. If $A$ is not regular, the cotangent complex $\mathbb L_{A|\boldsymbol k}$ may serve as a replacement for the $A$-module $\Omega_{A|\boldsymbol k}$. We prove that there is a structure of an $L_\infty$-algebroid on $\mathbb L_{A|\boldsymbol k}$, compatible with the Lie-Rinehart pair $(A,\Omega_{A|\boldsymbol k})$. The $L_\infty$-algebroid on $\mathbb L_{A|\boldsymbol k}$ actually comes from a $P_\infty$-algebra structure on the resolvent of the morphism $k[x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n]\to A$. We identify examples when this $L_\infty$-algebroid simplifies to a dg Lie algebroid. For aesthetic reasons we concentrate on cases when $ \boldsymbol k[x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n]$ carries a (possibly nonstandard) $\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$-grading and both $I$ and $\{\:,\:\}$ are homogeneous.</description>

      <title>The $a$-numbers of non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 3 with cyclic automorphism group of order 6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.09777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study non-hyperelliptic curves of genus $3$ with cyclic automorphism group of order $6$. Over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic $\neq 2,3$, such curves are written as plane quartics $C_r: x^3 z + y^4 + r y^2 z^2 + z^4 = 0$ with one parameter $r$. As the first main theorem, we show that $r\neq 0,\pm 2$ and give a necessary and sufficient condition with respect to $r$ and $r'$ such that $C_r \cong C_{r'}$. By describing the Hasse-Witt matrix of $C_r$ in terms of a certain Gauss' hypergeometric series, we obtain the second main theorem, where we determine the possible $a$-number of $C_r$, and give the exact number of isomorphism classes over $K$ of such curves attaining the possible maximal $a$-number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a survey article, with essentially complete proofs, of a series of recent results concerning the geometry of the characteristic foliation on smooth divisors in compact hyperk\"ahler manifolds, starting with work by Hwang-Viehweg, but also covering articles by Amerik-Campana and Abugaliev. The restriction of the holomorphic symplectic form on a hyperk\"ahler manifold $X$ to a smooth hypersurface $D\subset X$ leads to a regular foliation ${\mathcal F}\subset{\mathcal T}_D$ of rank one, the characteristic foliation. The picture is complete in dimension four and shows that the behavior of the leaves of ${\mathcal F}$ on $D$ is determined by the Beauville-Bogomolov square $q(D)$ of $D$. In higher dimensions, some of the results depend on the abundance conjecture for $D$.</description>

      <title>Partial Degeneration of Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensors are often studied by introducing preorders such as restriction and degeneration: the former describes transformations of the tensors by local linear maps on its tensor factors; the latter describes transformations where the local linear maps may vary along a curve, and the resulting tensor is expressed as a limit along this curve. In this work we introduce and study partial degeneration, a special version of degeneration where one of the local linear maps is constant whereas the others vary along a curve. Motivated by algebraic complexity, quantum entanglement and tensor networks, we present constructions based on matrix multiplication tensors and find examples by making a connection to the theory of prehomogeneous tensor spaces. We highlight the subtleties of this new notion by showing obstruction and classification results for the unit tensor. To this end, we study the notion of aided rank, a natural generalization of tensor rank. The existence of partial degenerations gives strong upper bounds on the aided rank of a tensor, which allows one to turn degenerations into restrictions. In particular, we present several examples, based on the W-tensor and the Coppersmith-Winograd tensors, where lower bounds on aided rank provide obstructions to the existence of certain partial degenerations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an effective Cartier divisor D on a scheme X we may form an nth root stack. Its derived category is known to have a semiorthogonal decomposition with components given by D and X. We show that this decomposition is 2n-periodic. For n=2 this gives a purely triangulated proof of the existence of a known spherical functor, namely the pushforward along the embedding of D. For n&gt;2 we find a higher spherical functor in the sense of recent work of Dyckerhoff, Kapranov and Schechtman. We use a realization of the root stack construction as a variation of GIT, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: For $n\geq 4$, let $X$ be a complex smooth Fano $n$-fold whose minimal anticanonical degree of non-free rational curves on $X$ is at least $n-2$. We classify extremal contractions of such varieties. As an application, we obtain a classification of Fano fourfolds with pseudoindex and Picard number greater than one. Combining this result with previous results, we complete the classification of smooth Fano $n$-folds with pseudoindex at least $n-2$ and Picard number greater than one. This can be seen as a generalization of various previous results. We also discuss the relations between pseudoindex and other invariants of Fano varieties.</description>

Abstract: We discuss how, under suitable assumptions, a K\"ahler test configuration admits a mirror Landau-Ginzburg model, giving a corresponding expression for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant as a residue pairing. We study the general behaviour of such mirror formulae under large scaling of the K\"ahler form. We exploit the observation that this scaling trivially preserves $K$-stability, but takes the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model to a large complex structure limit. In certain cases the mirror formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant simplify in this limit. We focus on a special type of limiting behaviour, when the Donaldson-Futaki invariant concentrates at a single critical point of the Landau-Ginzburg potential, and show that this leads to new formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant in terms of theta functions on the mirror. We provide a main application, which shows that such limiting behaviour actually occurs for test configurations in several nontrivial examples, both toric and non-toric, in the case of slope (in)stability for polarised surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a classical deflation process raised by Dayton, Li and Zeng is realized for the Brent equations, which provides new bounds for local dimensions of the solution set. Originally, this deflation process focuses on isolated solutions. We generalize it to the case of irreducible components and a related conjecture is given. We analyze its realization and apply it to the Brent equations. The decrease of the nullities is easily observed. So the deflation process can be served as a useful tool for determining the local dimensions. In addition, our result implies that along with the decrease of the tensor rank, the singular solutions will become more and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A specialization of a K3 surface with Picard rank one to a K3 with rank two defines a vanishing class of order two in the Brauer group of the general K3 surface. We give the B-field invariants of this class. We apply this to the K3 double plane defined by a cubic fourfold with a plane. The specialization of such a cubic fourfold whose group of codimension two cycles has rank two to one which has rank three induces such a specialization of the double planes. We determine the Picard lattice of the specialized double plane as well as the vanishing Brauer class and its relation to the natural "Clifford" Brauer class. This provides more insight in the specializations. It allows us to explicitly determine the K3 surfaces associated to infinitely many of the conjecturally rational cubic fourfolds obtained as such specializations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of a triple $(X,\Delta,D)$ which consists of a pair $(X,\Delta)$ and a polarizing pseudoeffective divisor $D$. The adjoint asymptotic multiplier ideal sheaf $\mathcal{J}(X,\Delta;\lVert D \rVert)$ associated to the triple gives a simultaneous generalization of the multiplier ideal sheaf $\mathcal{J}(D)$ and asymptotic multiplier ideal sheaf $\mathcal{J}(\lVert D \rVert)$. We describe the closed set defined by the ideal sheaf $\mathcal{J}(X,\Delta;\lVert D \rVert)$ in terms of the minimal model program. We also characterize the case where $\mathcal{J}(X,\Delta;\lVert D \rVert)=\mathcal{O}_X$. Lastly, we also prove a Nadel type vanishing theorem of cohomology using $\mathcal{J}(X,\Delta;\lVert D \rVert)$.</description>

      <title>The spectral genus of an isolated hypersurface singularity and a conjecture relating to the Milnor number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of spectral genus $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ of a germ of an isolated hypersurface singularity $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}, 0) \to (\mathbb{C}, 0)$, defined as a sum of small exponents of monodromy eigenvalues. The number of these is equal to the geometric genus $p_{g}$, and hence $\widetilde{p}_g$ can be considered as a secondary invariant to it. We then explore a secondary version of the Durfee conjecture on $p_{g}$, and we predict an inequality between $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ and the Milnor number $\mu$, to the effect that $$\widetilde{p}_g\leq\frac{\mu-1}{(n+2)!}.$$ We provide evidence by confirming our conjecture in several cases, including homogeneous singularities and singularities with large Newton polyhedra, and quasi-homogeneous or irreducible curve singularities. We also show that a weaker inequality follows from Durfee's conjecture, and hence holds for quasi-homogeneous singularities and curve singularities.
  Our conjecture is shown to relate closely to the asymptotic behavior of the holomorphic analytic torsion of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a degeneration of projective varieties, potentially indicating deeper geometric and analytic connections.</description>

Abstract: In this notes we study complex projective plane curves whose graded module of Jacobian syzygies is generated by its minimal degree component. Examples of such curves include the smooth curves as well as the maximal Tjurina curves. However, this class of curves seems to be surprisingly large. In particular, any line arrangement $\mathcal A$ of $d=2k+1\geq 5 $ lines having only double and triple points is in this class if the number of triple points is $k$ and if they are all situated on a line $L \in \mathcal A$, see Theorem 6.2</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.13929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field, and let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve over $K$. The Mordell--Weil theorem asserts that the $K$-rational points $E(K)$ of $E$ form a finitely generated abelian group. In this work, we complete the classification of the finite groups which appear as the torsion subgroup of $E(K)$ for $K$ a cubic number field.
  To do so, we determine the cubic points on the modular curves $X_1(N)$ for \[N = 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 39, 45, 65, 121.\] As part of our analysis, we determine the complete list of $N$ for which $J_0(N)$ (resp., $J_1(N)$, resp., $J_1(2,2N)$) has rank 0. We also provide evidence to a generalized version of a conjecture of Conrad, Edixhoven, and Stein by proving that the torsion on $J_1(N)(\mathbb{Q})$ is generated by $\text{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$-orbits of cusps of $X_1(N)_{\bar{\mathbb{Q}}}$ for $N\leq 55$, $N \neq 54$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Fourier transforms over finite fields: generic vanishing, convolution, and equidistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11961v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the arithmetic Fourier transforms of trace functions on general connected commutative algebraic groups. To do so, we first prove a generic vanishing theorem for twists of perverse sheaves by characters, and using this tool, we construct a tannakian category with convolution as tensor operation. Using Deligne's Riemann Hypothesis, we show how this leads to a general equidistribution theorem for the discrete Fourier transforms of trace functions of perverse sheaves, generalizing the work of Katz in the case of the multiplicative group. We then give some concrete examples of applications of these results and raise a number of questions.</description>

      <title>An algebraic geometry of paths via the iterated-integrals signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrary to previous approaches bringing together algebraic geometry and signatures of paths, we introduce a Zariski topology on the space of paths itself, and study path varieties consisting of all paths whose iterated-integrals signature satisfies certain polynomial equations. Particular emphasis lies on the role of the non-associative halfshuffle, which makes it possible to describe varieties of paths that satisfy certain relations all along their trajectory. Specifically, we may understand the set of paths on a given classical algebraic variety in $\mathbb{R}^d$ starting from a fixed point as a path variety, e.g. paths on a sphere. While the characteristic geometric property of halfshuffle varieties is that they are stable under stopping paths at an earlier time, we furthermore study varieties which are stable under the natural (semi)group operation of concantenation of paths. We point out how the notion of dimension for path varieties crucially depends on the fact that they may be reducible into countably infinitely many subvarieties. Finally, we see that studying halfshuffle varieties naturally leads to a generalization of classical algebraic curves, surfaces and affine varieties in finite dimensional space. These generalized algebraic sets, an example being the graph of the exponential function, are now described through iterated-integral equations.

      <title>K\"ahler families of Green's functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a remarkable series of works, Guo, Phong, Song, and Sturm have obtained key uniform estimates for the Green's functions associated with certain K\"ahler metrics. In this note, we broaden the scope of their techniques by removing one of their assumptions and allowing the complex structure to vary. We apply our results to various families of canonical K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Calabi-Yau four folds with hybrid and recurrent neural network architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report the results of applying deep learning based on hybrid convolutional-recurrent and purely recurrent neural network architectures to the dataset of almost one million complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds (CICY4) to machine-learn their four Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$. In particular, we explored and experimented with twelve different neural network models, nine of which are convolutional-recurrent (CNN-RNN) hybrids with the RNN unit being either GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The remaining four models are purely recurrent neural networks based on LSTM. In terms of the $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$ prediction accuracies, at 72% training ratio, our best performing individual model is CNN-LSTM-400, a hybrid CNN-LSTM with the LSTM hidden size of 400, which obtained 99.74%, 98.07%, 95.19%, 81.01%, our second best performing individual model is LSTM-448, an LSTM-based model with the hidden size of 448, which obtained 99.74%, 97.51%, 94.24%, and 78.63%. These results were improved by forming ensembles of the top two, three or even four models. Our best ensemble, consisting of the top four models, achieved the accuracies of 99.84%, 98.71%, 96.26%, 85.03%. At 80% training ratio, the top two performing models LSTM-448 and LSTM-424 are both LSTM-based with the hidden sizes of 448 and 424. Compared with the 72% training ratio, there is a significant improvement of accuracies, which reached 99.85%, 98.66%, 96.26%, 84.77% for the best individual model and 99.90%, 99.03%, 97.97%, 87.34% for the best ensemble.</description>

      <title>Monodromy groups and exceptional Hodge classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denote by $J_m$ the Jacobian variety of the hyperelliptic curve defined by the affine equation $y^2=x^m+1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, where $m \geq 3$ is a fixed positive integer. We compute several interesting arithmetic invariants of $J_m$: its decomposition up to isogeny into simple abelian varieties, the minimal field $\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$ over which its endomorphisms are defined, its connected monodromy field $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})$, and its Sato-Tate group. Currently, there is no general algorithm that computes these last two invariants. Furthermore, for large enough values of $m$, the abelian varieties $J_m$ provide non-trivial examples of high-dimensional phenomena, such as degeneracy and the non-triviality of the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})/\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$. Finally, we describe the Sato-Tate group of an abelian variety, generalizing existing results that apply only to non-degenerate varieties.</description>
