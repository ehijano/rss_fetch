      <title>Local existence of solutions to a nonlinear autonomous PDE model for population dynamics with nonlocal transport and competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a particular nondegenerate, nonlinear, autonomous parabolic partial differential equation with a nonlocal mass transfer admits the local existence of classical solutions. The equation was developed to qualitatively describe temporal changes in population densities over space through accounting for location desirability and fast, long-range travel. Beginning with sufficiently regular initial conditions, through smoothing the PDE and employing energy arguments, we obtain a sequence of approximators converging to a classical solution.</description>

      <title>The Immersed Inextensible Interface Problem in 2D Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an inextensible, closed interface subject to bending forces and immersed in a two-dimensional and incompressible Stokes fluid. We formulate the problem as a boundary integral equation in terms of the tangent angle and demonstrate the well-posedness in suitable time-weighted spaces of the resulting nonlinear and nonlocal system. The solution is furthermore shown to be smooth for positive times. Numerical computations are performed to initiate the study of the long-time behavior of the interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the global hypoellipticity, almost hypoellipticity and solvability for a class of systems of real vector fields on the (n + 1)-dimensional torus as well as the same properties about the sum of squares associated to the system. The key result is a theorem about propagation of regularity for solutions of the system.</description>

      <title>A variable diffusivity fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution to the generalized, variable diffusivity, fractional Laplace equation on the unit disk in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. For $\alpha$ the order of the differential operator, our results show that for the symmetric, positive definite, diffusivity matrix, $K(\mathbf{x})$, satisfying $\lambda_{m} \mathbf{v}^{T} \mathbf{v} \le \mathbf{v}^{T} K(\mathbf{x}) \mathbf{v} \le \lambda_{M} \mathbf{v}^{T} \mathbf{v}$, for all $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{2}$, $\mathbf{x} \in \Omega$, with $\lambda_{M} &lt; \frac{\sqrt{\alpha (2 + \alpha)}}{(2 - \alpha)} \lambda_{m}$, the problem has a unique solution. The regularity of the solution is given in an appropriately weighted Sobolev space in terms of the regularity of the right hand side function and $K(\mathbf{x})$.</description>

      <title>The hyperbolic X-ray transform: new range characterizations, mapping properties and functional relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new singular value decompositions and range characterizations for the X-ray transform on the Poincar\'e disk, a surjectivity result for the backprojection operator, as well as new functional settings and intertwining relations with appropriately defined differential operators. The approach mainly exploits analogous results recently obtained for the Euclidean disk, together with the projective equivalence between the two models.</description>

      <title>A LWR model with constraints at moving interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical framework to the study of scalar conservation laws with moving interfaces. This framework is developed on a LWR model with constraint on the flux along these moving interfaces. Existence is proved by means of a finite volume scheme. The originality lies in the local modification of the mesh and in the treatment of the crossing points of the trajectories.</description>

      <title>Bochner-Riesz means for critical magnetic Schr\"odinger operators in ${\mathbb R^2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $L^p$-boundedness of the Bochner-Riesz means for critical magnetic Schr\"odinger operators $\mathcal{L}_{\bf A}$ in ${\mathbb{R}^2}$, which involve the physcial Aharonov-Bohm potential. We show that for $1\leq p\leq +\infty$ and $p\neq 2$, the Bochner-Riesz operator $S_{\lambda}^\delta(\mathcal{L}_{\bf A})$ of order $\delta$ is bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^2)$ if and only if $\delta&gt;\max\big\{0, 2\big|1/2-1/p\big|-1/2\big\}$. The new ingredient of the proof is to obtain the localized $L^4(\mathbb R^2)$ estimate of $S_{\lambda}^\delta(\mathcal{L}_{\bf A})$, whose kernel is heavily affected by the physical magnetic diffraction, and more singular than the classical Bochner-Riesz means $S_{\lambda}^\delta(\Delta)$ for the Laplacian $\Delta$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Kinetic energy and streamline properties for irrotational equatorial wind waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate kinetic energy and streamline properties for an irrotational periodic geophysical traveling surface water waves propagating in equatorial oceanic regions. Relying on the methods from the complex analysis, we prove the logarithmic convexity and monotonicity of specific flow variables. By means of conformal mappings, we derive some qualitative results for kinetic energy and streamline, such as streamline time-period being independent of any moment and any point on the streamline in steady flow, the concavity and monotonicity of total kinetic energy within the region between two streamlines and the convexity and monotonicity of total kinetic energy over a streamline time-period. Moreover, we present several results about irrotational equatorial wind waves, such as an upper bound of the minimum of streamline time-period, an upper bound of the maximum of area within the region between two streamlines. Taking advantage of the Bernoulli's law and the Schwarz reflection principle, we show that the extremum of the kinetic energy is attained on the free surface for irrotational equatorial wind waves.</description>

      <title>Structure of singularities for the Euler-Poisson system of ion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of singularity for the isothermal Euler-Poisson system arising from plasma physics. Contrast to the previous studies yielding only limited information on the blow-up solutions, for instance, sufficient conditions for the blow-up and the temporal blow-up rate along the characteristic curve, we rather give a constructive proof of singularity formation from smooth initial data. More specifically, employing the stable blow-up profile of the Burgers equation in the self-similar variables, we establish the global stability estimate in the self-similar time, which yields the asymptotic behavior of blow-up solutions near the singularity point. Our analysis indicates that the smooth solution to the Euler-Poisson system can develop a cusp-type singularity; it exhibits $C^1$ blow-up in a finite time, while it belongs to $C^{1/3}$ at the blow-up time, provided that smooth initial data are sufficiently close to the blow-up profile in some weighted $C^4$-topology. We also present a similar result for the isentropic case, and discuss noteworthy differences in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Flows and Their Applications in Parabolic-parabolic Patlak-Keller-Segel Systems Part I: Alternating Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional parabolic-parabolic Patlak-Keller-Segel equations (PKS) subject to ambient flows. Without the ambient fluid flow, the equation is super-critical in three-dimension and has finite-time blow-up solutions with arbitrarily small $L^1$-mass. In this study, we show that a family of time-dependent alternating shear flows, inspired by the clever ideas of Tarek Elgindi, can suppress the chemotactic blow-up in these systems.</description>

      <title>On finding bifurcations for non-variational elliptic systems by the extended quotients method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel method for finding bifurcations for nonlinear systems of equations based on directly finding bifurcations through saddle points of extended quotients. The method is applied to find the saddle-node bifurcation point for elliptic equations with the nonlinearity of the general convex-concave type. The main result justifies the variational formula for the detection of the maximum saddle-node type bifurcation point of stable positive solutions. As a consequence, a precise threshold value separating the interval of the existence of stable positive solutions is established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence and uniqueness of a transmission problem in simply connected domains in the plane with data in weighted Lebesgue spaces by first investigating solvability results of a related novel problem associated to a homeomorphism in the real line and domains given by the upper and lower half planes. Our techniques are based on the use of conformal maps and Rellich identities for the Hilbert transform, and are motivated by previous works concerning the Dirichlet, Neumann and Zaremba problems.</description>

      <title>Sharp Spectral Projection Estimates for the Torus at $p_c=\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sharp spectral projection estimates for tori in all dimensions at the exponent $p_c=\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1}$ for shrinking windows of width $1$ down to windows of length $\lambda^{-1+\kappa}$ for fixed $\kappa&gt;0$. This improves and slightly generalizes the work of Blair-Huang-Sogge who proved sharp results for windows of width $\lambda^{-\frac{1}{n+3}}$, and the work of Hickman, Germain-Myerson, and Demeter-Germain who proved results for windows of all widths but incurred a sub-polynomial loss. Our work uses the approaches of these two groups of authors, combining the bilinear decomposition and microlocal techniques of Blair-Huang-Sogge with the decoupling theory and explicit lattice point lemmas used by Hickman, Germain-Myerson, and Demeter-Germain to remove these losses.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic profiles of ground state solutions for Choquard equations with a general local perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of ground state solutions for the nonlinear Choquard equation with a general local perturbation $$ -\Delta u+\varepsilon u=(I_\alpha \ast |u|^{p})|u|^{p-2}u+ g(u), \quad {\rm in} \ \mathbb R^N,
  \eqno(P_\varepsilon)
  $$
where $N\ge 3$ is an integer, $p=\frac{N+\alpha}{N}$, or $\frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}$, $I_\alpha$ is the Riesz potential and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a parameter. Under some mild conditions on $g(u)$, we show that as $\varepsilon\to \infty$, after {\em a suitable rescaling} the ground state solutions of $(P_\varepsilon)$ converge to a particular solution of some limit equations, and establish a sharp asymptotic characterisation of such a rescaling, which depend in a non-trivial way on the asymptotic behavior of the function $g(s)$ at infinity and the space dimension $N$. Based on this study, we also present some results on the existence and asymptotic behaviors of positive normalized solutions of $(P_\varepsilon)$ with the normalization constraint $\int_{\mathbb R^N}|u|^2=a^2$. Particularly, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of positive normalized solutions of such a problem as $a\to 0$ and $a\to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Pogorelov type $C^2$ estimates for semi-convex admissible solutions to the Dirichlet problem of $k$-Hessian equation with general right hand side. Under some sufficient conditions, we apply such estimates to obtain rigidity theorems for semi-convex admissible solutions of $k$-Hessian equation, which can be seen as a improvement of Li-Ren-Wang and Chu-Dinew's rigidity theorem for $k$-Hessian equation. When $2k&gt;n$, we also obtain Pogorelov type $C^2$ estimates for admissible solutions to the Dirichlet problem of $k$-Hessian equation based on a concavity inequality, which is inspired by the Ren-Wang's work on the global curvature estimates for the $n-1$ and $n-2$ curvature equation.</description>

Abstract: We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for solving a general class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations on closed Riemannian or hermitian manifolds, including both hessian and hessian quotient equations. It settles an open problem of Li and Urbas. Such a condition is based on an analytic slope invariant analogous to the slope stability and the Nakai-Moishezon criterion in complex geometry. As an application, we solve the non-constant $J$-equation on both hermitian manifolds and singular K\"ahler spaces.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates, uniqueness and spikes condensation for superlinear free boundary problems arising in plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with Grad-Shafranov type equations, describing in dimension $N=2$ the equilibrium configurations of a plasma in a Tokamak. We obtain a sharp superlinear generalization of the result of Temam (1977) about the linear case, implying the first general uniqueness result ever for superlinear free boundary problems arising in plasma physics. Previous general uniqueness results of Beresticky-Brezis (1980) were concerned with globally Lipschitz nonlinearities. In dimension $N\geq 3$ the uniqueness result is new but not sharp, motivating the local analysis of a spikes condensation-quantization phenomenon for superlinear and subcritical singularly perturbed Grad-Shafranov type free boundary problems, implying among other things a converse of the results about spikes condensation in Flucher-Wei (1998) and Wei (2001). Interestingly enough, in terms of the "physical" global variables, we come up with a concentration-quantization-compactness result sharing the typical features of critical problems (Yamabe $N\geq 3$, Liouville $N=2$) but in a subcritical setting, the singular behavior being induced by a sort of infinite mass limit, in the same spirit of Brezis-Merle (1991).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior toward viscous shock for impermeable wall and inflow problem of barotropic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations in a half-line and study the time-asymptotic behavior toward the outgoing viscous shock wave. Precisely, we consider the two boundary problems: impermeable wall and inflow problems, where the velocity at the boundary is given as a constant state. For both problems, when the asymptotic profile determined by the prescribed constant states at the boundary and far-fields is a viscous shock, we show that the solution asymptotically converges to the shifted viscous shock profiles uniformly in space, under the condition that initial perturbation is small enough in H1 norm. We do not impose the zero mass condition on initial data, which improves the previous results by Matsumura and Mei [20] for impermeable case, and by Huang, Matsumura and Shi [8] for inflow case. Moreover, for the inflow case, we remove the assumption in [8]. Our results are based on the method of a-contraction with shifts, as the first extension of the method to the boundary value problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the global existence and scattering of small data smooth solutions to a class of quasilinear wave systems on the product space $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}$. These quasilinear wave systems include 3D irrotational potential flow equation of Chaplygin gases, 3D relativistic membrane equation, some 3D quasilinear wave equations which come from the corresponding Lagrangian functionals as perturbations of the Lagrangian densities of linear waves, and nonlinear wave maps system. Through looking for some suitable transformations of unknown functions, the nonlinear wave system can be reduced into a more tractable form. Subsequently, by applying the vector-field method together with the ghost weight technique as well as deriving some kinds of weighted $L^\infty-L^\infty$ and $L^\infty-L^2$ estimates of solution $w$ to the 2D linear wave equation $\Box w=f(t,x)$, the global existence and scattering of small data solutions are established.</description>

      <title>H\"older Continuity and Harnack estimate for non-homogeneous parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study on intrinsic Harnack inequality for non- homogeneous parabolic equations in non-divergence form initiated by the first author in [1]. We establish a forward-in-time intrinsic Harnack inequality, which in particular implies the H\"older continuity of the solutions. We also provide a Harnack type estimate on global scale which quantifies the strong minimum principle. In the time-independent setting, this together with [1] provides an alternative proof of the generalized Harnack inequality proven by the second author in [9].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Weingarten curvature equations for $k$-convex hypersurfaces with $n&lt;2k$ in a warped product manifold $\overline{M}=I\times_{\lambda}M$. Based on the conjecture proposed by Ren-Wang in \cite{Ren2}, which is valid for $k\geq n-2$, we derive curvature estimates for equation $\sigma_k(\kappa)= \psi (V, \nu (V))$ through a straightforward proof. Furthermore, we also obtain an existence result for the star-shaped compact hypersurface $\Sigma$ satisfying the above equation by the degree theory under some sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>One-side Liouville theorems under an exponential growth condition for Kolmogorov operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that for a possibly degenerate hypoelliptic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator $$ L= \frac{1}{2}\text{ tr} (QD^2 ) + \langle Ax, D \rangle = \frac{1}{2}\text{ div} (Q D ) + \langle Ax, D \rangle,\;\; x \in R^N, $$ all (globally) bounded solutions of $Lu=0$ on $R^N$ are constant if and only if all the eigenvalues of $A$ have non-positive real parts (i.e., $s(A) \le 0)$. We show that if $Q$ is positive definite and $s(A) \le 0$, then any non-negative solution $v$ of $Lv=0$ on $R^N$ which has at most an exponential growth is indeed constant. Thus under a non-degeneracy condition we relax the boundedness assumption on the harmonic functions and maintain the sharp condition on the eigenvalues of $A$. We also prove a related one-side Liouville theorem in the case of hypoelliptic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators.</description>

      <title>On anomalous dissipation induced by transport noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that suitable transport noises produce anomalous dissipation of energy of solutions to the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and diffusion equations in all dimensions. The key ingredients are Meyers' type estimates for SPDEs with transport noise which are combined with recent scaling limits for such SPDEs. The former allow us to obtain, for the first time for such type of scaling limits, convergence in a space of positive smoothness uniformly in time. Compared to known results, one of the main novelties is that anomalous dissipation might take place even in presence of a transport noise of arbitrarily small intensity. Further, we discuss physical interpretations.</description>

      <title>Rectifiable Reifenberg and uniform positivity under almost calibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reifenberg theorem \cite{reif_orig} tells us that if a set $S\subseteq B_2\subseteq \mathbb R^n$ is uniformly close on all points and scales to a $k$-dimensional subspace, then $S$ is H\"older homeomorphic to a $k$-dimensional Euclidean ball. In general this is sharp, for instance such an $S$ may have infinite volume, be fractal in nature, and have no rectifiable structure.
  The goal of this note is to show that we can improve upon this for an almost calibrated Reifenberg set, or more generally under a positivity condition in the context of an $\epsilon$-calibration $\Omega$ . An $\epsilon$-calibration is very general, the condition holds locally for all continuous $k$-forms such that $\Omega[L]\leq 1+\epsilon$ for all $k$-planes $L$. We say an oriented $k$-plane $L$ is $\alpha$-positive with respect to $\Omega$ if $\Omega[L]&gt;\alpha&gt;0$. If $\Omega[L]&gt;\alpha&gt; 1-\epsilon$ then we call $L$ an $\epsilon$-calibrated plane.
  The main result of this paper is then the following. Assume at all points and scales $B_r(x)\subseteq B_2$ that $S$ is $\delta$-Hausdorff close to a subspace $L_{x,r}$ which is uniformly positive $\Omega[L_{x,r}]&gt;\alpha $ with respect to an $\epsilon$-calibration. Then $S$ is $k$-rectifiable with uniform volume bounds.</description>

Abstract: We consider backward problems for semilinear coupled parabolic systems in bounded domains. We prove conditional stability estimates for linear and semilinear systems of strongly coupled parabolic equations involving general semilinearities. The proof of the stability estimates relies on a modified method by Carleman estimates incorporating the simple weight function $e^{\lambda t}$ with a sufficiently large parameter $\lambda$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a volume- or area-preserving curvature flow for hypersurfaces with capillary boundary in the half-space, with speed given by a positive power of the mean curvature with a non-local averaging term. We demonstrate that for any convex initial hypersurface with a capillary boundary, the flow exists for all time and smoothly converges to a spherical cap as $t \to +\infty$</description>

      <title>Solutions to ${\rm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system with cone singularities via toric curves on compact Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a compact Riemann surface (X) with finite punctures (P_1, \ldots, P_k), we define toric curves as multi-valued, totally unramified holomorphic maps to (\mathbb{P}^n) with monodromy in a maximal torus of ({\rm PSU}(n+1)). \textit{Toric solutions} for the ({\rm SU}(n+1)) system on $X\setminus\{P_1,\ldots, P_k\}$ are recognized by their associated {\it toric} curves in (\mathbb{P}^n). We introduce a character n-ensemble as an (n)-tuple of meromorphic one-forms with simple poles and purely imaginary periods, generating toric curves on (X) minus finitely many points. We establish on $X$ a correspondence between character $n$-ensembles and toric solutions to the ({\rm SU}(n+1)) system with finitely many cone singularities. Our approach not only broadens seminal solutions for up to two cone singularities on the Riemann sphere, as classified by Jost-Wang (Int. Math. Res. Not., (6):277-290, 2002) and Lin-Wei-Ye (Invent. Math., 190(1):169-207, 2012), but also advances beyond the limits of Lin-Yang-Zhong's existence theorems (J. Differential Geom., 114(2):337-391, 2020) by introducing a new solution class.</description>

      <title>Topological Photonic Structures with Broken Reflection Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical theory for Dirac points and interface modes in honeycomb topological photonic structures consisting of impenetrable obstacles. Starting from a honeycomb lattice of obstacles attaining $120^\circ$-rotation symmetry and horizontal reflection symmetry, we apply the boundary integral equation method to show the existence of Dirac points for the first two bands at the vertices of the Brillouin zone. We then study interface modes in a joint honeycomb photonic structure, which consists of two periodic lattices obtained by perturbing the honeycomb one with Dirac points differently. The perturbations break the reflection symmetry of the system, as a result, they annihilate the Dirac points and generate two structures with different topological phases, which mimics the quantum valley Hall effect in topological insulators. We investigate the interface modes that decay exponentially away from the interface of the joint structure in several configurations with different interface geometries, including the zigzag interface, the armchair interface, and the rational interfaces. Using the layer potential technique and asymptotic analysis, we first characterize the band-gap opening for the two perturbed periodic structures and derive the asymptotic expansions of the Bloch modes near the band gap surfaces. By formulating the eigenvalue problem for each joint honeycomb structure using boundary integral equations over the interface and analyzing the characteristic values of the associated boundary integral operators, we prove the existence of interface modes when the perturbation is small.</description>

      <title>On the normal stability of the 4-harmonic and the ES-4-harmonic hypersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both 4-harmonic and ES-4-harmonic maps are two higher order generalizations of the well-studied harmonic map equation given by a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation of order eight. Due to the large number of derivatives it is very difficult to find any difference in the qualitative behavior of these two variational problems. It is well known that the small hypersphere $\iota\colon\mathbb{S}^m(\frac{1}{\sqrt{4}})\to\mathbb{S}^{m+1}$ is a critical point of both the 4-energy as well as the ES-4-energy but up to now it has not been investigated if there is a difference concerning its stability.
  The main contribution of this article is to show that the small hypersphere is unstable with respect to normal variations both as 4-harmonic hypersphere as well as ES-4-harmonic hypersphere and that its normal index equals one in both cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain order sharp spectral estimates for the difference of resolvents of singularly perturbed elliptic operators $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{V}_1$ and $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{V}_2$ in a domain $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^\mathbf{N}$ with perturbations $\mathbf{V}_1, \mathbf{V}_2$ generated by $V_1\mu,V_2\mu,$ where $\mu$ is a measure singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure and satisfying two-sided or one-sided conditions of Ahlfors type, while $V_1,V_2$ are weight functions subject to some integral conditions. As an important special case, spectral estimates for the difference of resolvents of two Robin realizations of the operator $\mathbf{A}$ with different weight functions are obtained. For the case when the support of the measure is a compact Lipschitz hypersurface in $\Omega$ or, more generally, a rectifiable set of Hau{\ss}dorff dimension $d=\mathbf{N}-1$, the Weyl type asymptotics for eigenvalues is justified.</description>

      <title>On Wave-Like Differential Equations in General Hilbert Space. The Functional Analytic Investigation of Euler-Bernoulli Bending Vibrations of a Beam as an Application in Engineering Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-like partial differential equations occur in many engineering applications. Here the engineering setup is embedded into the Hilbert space framework of functional analysis of modern mathematical physics. The notion wave-like is a generalization of the primary wave (partial) differential equation.
  A short overview over three wave-like problems in physics and engineering is presented. The mathematical procedure for achieving positive, selfadjoint differential operators in an $\mathrm{L}^2$-Hilbert space is described, operators which then may be taken for wave-like differential equations. Also some general results from the functional analytic literature are summarized.
  The main part concerns the investigation of the free Euler--Bernoulli bending vibrations of a slender, straight, elastic beam in one spatial dimension in the $\mathrm{L}^2$-Hilbert space setup. Taking suitable Sobolev spaces we perform the mathematically exact introduction and analysis of the corresponding (spatial) positive, selfadjoint differential operators of $4$-th order, which belong to the different boundary conditions arising as supports in statics. A comparison with free wave swinging of a string is added, using a Laplacian as differential operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unique solvability and error analysis of the original Lagrange multiplier approach proposed in [8] for gradient flows is studied in this paper. We identify a necessary and sufficient condition that must be satisfied for the nonlinear algebraic equation arising from the original Lagrange multiplier approach to admit a unique solution in the neighborhood of its exact solution, and propose a modified Lagrange multiplier approach so that the computation can continue even if the aforementioned condition is not satisfied. Using Cahn-Hilliard equation as an example, we prove rigorously the unique solvability and establish optimal error estimates of a second-order Lagrange multiplier scheme assuming this condition and that the time step is sufficient small. We also present numerical results to demonstrate that the modified Lagrange multiplier approach is much more robust and can use much larger time step than the original Lagrange multiplier approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the asymptotic-preserving properties of a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the Westervelt model of ultrasound waves. More precisely, we show that the proposed method is robust with respect to small values of the sound diffusivity damping parameter~$\delta$ by deriving low- and high-order energy stability estimates, and \emph{a priori} error bounds that are independent of~$\delta$. Such bounds are then used to show that, when~$\delta \rightarrow 0^+$, the method remains stable and the discrete acoustic velocity potential~$\psi_h^{(\delta)}$ converges to~$\psi_h^{(0)}$, where the latter is the singular vanishing dissipation limit. Moreover, we prove optimal convergence for the approximation of the acoustic particle velocity variable~$\bv = \nabla \psi$. The established theoretical results are illustrated with some numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10758v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the small-time global approximate controllability for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows in smoothly bounded two- or three-dimensional domains. The controls act on arbitrary nonempty open portions of each connected boundary component, while linearly coupled Navier slip-with-friction conditions are imposed along the uncontrolled parts of the boundary. Some choices for the friction coefficients give rise to interacting velocity and magnetic field boundary layers. We obtain sufficient dissipation properties of these layers by a detailed analysis of the corresponding asymptotic expansions. For certain friction coefficients, or if the obtained controls are not compatible with the induction equation, an additional pressure-like term appears. We show that such a term does not exist for problems defined in planar simply-connected domains and various choices of Navier slip-with-friction boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give a new proof that any very weak $s$-harmonic function $u$ in the unit ball $B$ is smooth. As a first step, we improve the local summability properties of $u$. Then, we exploit a suitable version of the difference quotient method tailored to get rid of the singularity of the integral kernel and gain Sobolev regularity and local linear estimates of the $H^{s}_{\rm loc}$ norm of $u$. Finally, by applying more standard methods, such as elliptic regularity and Schauder estimates, we reach real analyticity of $u$. Up to the authors' knowledge, the difference quotient techniques are new.</description>

      <title>The Westervelt--Pennes--Cattaneo model: local well-posedness and singular limit for vanishing relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a mathematical model of nonlinear ultrasonic heating based on a coupled system of the Westervelt equation and the hyperbolic Pennes bioheat equation (Westervelt--Pennes--Cattaneo model). Using the energy method together with a fixed point argument, we prove that our model is locally well-posed and does not degenerate under a smallness assumption on the pressure data in the Westervelt equation. In addition, we perform a singular limit analysis and show that the Westervelt--Pennes--Fourier model can be seen as an approximation of the Westervelt--Pennes--Cattaneo model as the relaxation parameter tends to zero. This is done by deriving uniform bounds of the solution with respect to the relaxation parameter.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of spectral multipliers for the twisted Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove boundedness results on modulation and Wiener amalgam spaces for some families of spectral multipliers for the twisted Laplacian. We exploit the metaplectic equivalence relating the twisted Laplacian with a partial harmonic oscillator, leading to a general transference principle for the corresponding spectral multipliers. Our analysis encompasses powers of the twisted Laplacian and oscillating multipliers, with applications to the corresponding Schr\"odinger and wave flows. On the other hand, elaborating on the twisted convolution structure of the eigenprojections and its connection with the Weyl product of symbols, we obtain a complete picture of the boundedness of the heat flow for the twisted Laplacian. Results of the same kind are established for fractional heat flows via subordination.</description>

      <title>Imaging of piecewise nonlinear materials: the Monotonicity Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is focused on the Monotonicity Principle (MP) for nonlinear materials with piecewise growth exponent. This results are relevant because enables the use of a fast imaging method based on MP, to the wide class of problems with two or more materials, where at least one is nonlinear.
  The treatment is very general and allows to model a wide variety of practical configurations such as, for instance, Superconducting (SC) or Perfect Electrical Conducting (PEC) or Perfect Electrical Insulating (PEI) materials.
  A key role is played by the average Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, introduced in [Corbo Esposito et. al, Inverse Problems 2021], where the MP for a single type of nonlinearity was treated.
  Realistic numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Nonradial nondegeneracy and uniqueness of positive solutions to a class of fractional semilinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10577v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that positive solutions $u\in H^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to the equation $(-\Delta )^s u+ u=u^p$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ are nonradially nondegenerate, for all $s\in (0,1)$, $N\geq 1$ and $p&gt;1$ strictly smaller than the critical Sobolev exponent. By this we mean that the linearized equation $(-\Delta )^s w+ w-pu^{p-1}w = 0$ does not admit nonradial solutions beside the directional derivatives of $u$. Letting $B$ be the unit centered ball and $\lambda_1(B)$ the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta )^s$, we also prove that positive solutions to $(-\Delta )^s u+\lambda u=u^p$ in ${B}$ with $u=0$ on $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus B$, are nonradially nondegenerate for any $\lambda&gt; -\lambda_1(B)$ in the sense that the linearized equation does not admit nonradial solutions. From the latter result, we then deduce uniqueness and full nondegeneracy of positive solutions in the special case $N=1$ and $\lambda = 0$. Moreover, we deduce uniqueness of positive ground state solutions in the case $N=1$, $\lambda \ge 0$.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples and weak (1,1) estimates of wave operators for fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to investigating the $L^p$-bounds of wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ associated with fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators $H=\Delta^2+V$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$. We consider that real potentials satisfy $|V(x)|\lesssim \langle x\rangle^{-\mu}$ for some $\mu&gt;0$. A recent work by Goldberg and Green \cite{GoGr21} has demonstrated that wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ under the condition that $\mu&gt;9$, and zero is a regular point of $H$. In this paper, we aim to further establish endpoint estimates for $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ in two significant ways. First, we provide counterexamples that illustrate the unboundedness of $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ on the endpoint spaces $L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ and $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$, even for non-zero compactly supported potentials $V$. Second, we establish weak (1,1) estimates for the wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ and their dual operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)^*$ in the case where zero is a regular point and $\mu&gt;11$. These estimates depend critically on the singular integral theory of Calder\'on-Zygmund on a homogeneous space $(X,d\omega)$ with a doubling measure $d\omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existence of global finite-time bounded entropy solutions to a parabolic-parabolic system proposed in [16] is established in bounded domains under no-flux boundary conditions for nonnegative bounded initial data. This modification of the classical Keller-Segel model features degenerate diffusion and chemotaxis that are both subject to flux-saturation. The approach is based on Schauder's fixed point theorem and calculus of functions of bounded variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of establishing the existence of the Ground States for the subcritical focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy on a domain made of a line and a plane intersecting at a point. The problem is physically motivated by the experimental realization of hybrid traps for Bose-Einstein Condensates, that are able to concentrate the system on structures close to the domain we consider. In fact, such a domain approximates the trap as the temperature approaches the absolute zero. The spirit of the paper is mainly pedagogical, so we focus on the formulation of the problem and on the explanation of the result, giving references for the technical points and for the proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of a $d$-dimensional Klein-Gordon lattice with periodic boundary conditions, for $d \leq 3$. We consider initial data supported on one low-frequency Fourier mode. We show that, in the continuous approximation, the resonant normal form of the system is given by a small-dispersion nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. By exploiting a result about the growth of Sobolev norms for solutions of small-dispersion NLS, we are able to describe an energy cascade phenomenon for the Klein-Gordon lattice, where part of the energy is transferred to modes associated to higher frequencies. Such phenomenon holds within the time-scale for which we can ensure the validity of the continuous approximation.</description>

Abstract: We show there are no extremal metrics for the eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian on any compact manifold. Nonetheless, we construct examples of conformally extremal metrics for the eigenvalues of this operator in any annulus and characterise these special metrics in the general case of a compact manifold of dimension $n \geq 2$. As for the Dirichlet Laplacian, we prove non existence of extremal metrics on any compact surface.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness when the $L_p$ curvature is close to be a constant for $p\in[0,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For fixed positive integer $n$, $p\in[0,1]$, $a\in(0,1)$, we prove that if a function $g:\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\to \mathbb{R}$ is sufficiently close to 1, in the $C^a$ sense, then there exists a unique convex body $K$ whose $L_p$ curvature function equals $g$. This was previously established for $n=3$, $p=0$ by Chen, Feng, Liu \cite{CFL22} and in the symmetric case by Chen, Huang, Li, Liu \cite{CHLL20}. Related, we show that if $p=0$ and $n=4$ or $n\leq 3$ and $p\in[0,1)$, and the $L_p$ curvature function $g$ of a (sufficiently regular, containing the origin) convex body $K$ satisfies $\lambda^{-1}\leq g\leq \lambda$, for some $\lambda&gt;1$, then $\max_{x\in\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}h_K(x)\leq C(p,\lambda)$, for some constant $C(p,\lambda)&gt;0$ that depends only on $p$ and $\lambda$. This also extends a result from Chen, Feng, Liu \cite{CFL22}. Along the way, we obtain a result, that might be of independent interest, concerning the question of when the support of the $L_p$ surface area measure is lower dimensional. Finally, we establish a strong non-uniqueness result for the $L_p$-Minkowksi problem, for $-n&lt;p&lt;0$.</description>

Abstract: Quaternionic Calabi conjecture was raised by Alesker and Verbitsky \cite{Alesker-Verbitsky (2010)}, it predicts that one can solve the quaternionic Monge-Amp\`ere equation on any compact HKT manifold. Motivated by this conjecture a quaternionic version of Gauduchon conjecture on any compact $SL(n,\H)$-manifold will be introduced, namely the existence of quaternionic Gauduchon metrics with prescribed volume form. We reformulate this question into a special case of fully nonlinear elliptic equations of second order, and the $L^{\infty}$ estimate for the potential function will be established.</description>

      <title>A weighted Reilly formula for differential forms and sharp Steklov eigenvalue estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First we establish a weighted Reilly formula for differential forms on a smooth compact oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary. Then we give two applications of this formula when the manifold satisfies certain geometric conditions. One is a sharp lower bound for the first positive eigenvalue of the Steklov eigenvalue problem on differential forms investigated by Belishev and Sharafutdinov (2008) and Karpukhin (2019). The other one is a comparison result between the spectrum of this Steklov eigenvalue problem and the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian on the boundary of the manifold. Besides, at the end we discuss an open problem for differential forms analogous to Escobar's conjecture (1999) for functions.</description>

      <title>Completeness and geodesic distance properties for fractional Sobolev metrics on spaces of immersed curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of the space of immersed closed curves equipped with reparametrization-invariant Riemannian metrics; the metrics we consider are Sobolev metrics of possible fractional order $q\in [0,\infty)$. We establish the critical Sobolev index on the metric for several key geometric properties. Our first main result shows that the Riemannian metric induces a metric space structure if and only if $q&gt;1/2$. Our second main result shows that the metric is geodesically-complete (i.e., the geodesic equation is globally well-posed) if $q&gt;3/2$, whereas if $q&lt;3/2$ then finite-time blowup may occur. The geodesic-completeness for $q&gt;3/2$ is obtained by proving metric-completeness of the space of $H^q$-immersed curves with the distance induced by the Riemannian metric.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e, P. Bohl and A. Denjoy. P. Bohl, back in 1916, emphasised the importance of the transfer of the results for the order $k=1$ to the case $k&gt;1$, adding at the same time: "However, any attempt to do so would be hopeless". The following more than hundred years have only confirmed Bohl's forecast. It became clear that a new approach to this problem is needed.
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying certain important conditions. Limit sets and left and right rotation vectors appear in the case $k&gt;1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1.$ Under simple and natural conditions, the left and right rotation vectors coincide and a precise analog of the well-known H. Poincar\'e's result is derived for $k&gt;1$.</description>
