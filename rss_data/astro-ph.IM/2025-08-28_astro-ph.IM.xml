      <title>VIPER: A high-resolution multimode fiber-fed VIPA spectrograph concept for characterizing exoplanet atmospheric escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of applications in exoplanetary science require spectrographs with high resolution and high throughput without the need for a broad spectral range. Examples include the search for biosignatures through the detection of the oxygen A-band at 760 nm, and the study of atmospheric escape through the helium 1083 nm triplet. These applications align well with the capabilities of a spectrograph based on a Virtually Imaged Phased Array (VIPA), a high-throughput dispersive element that is essentially a modified Fabry-Perot etalon. We are developing VIPER, a high-resolution, narrowband, multimode fiber-fed VIPA spectrograph specifically designed to observe the helium 1083 nm triplet absorption line in the atmospheres of gaseous exoplanets. VIPER will achieve a resolving power of 300,000 over a wavelength range of 25 nm, and will be cross-dispersed by an echelle grating. VIPER is intended for operation on the 1.5 m Tillinghast Telescope and potentially on the 6.5 m MMT, both located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, USA. In this paper, we present VIPER's instrument requirements, derived from the primary science goal of detecting anisotropic atmospheric escape from exoplanets. We discuss the design methodology for VIPA-based spectrographs aimed at maximizing throughput and diffraction efficiency, and we derive a wave-optics-based end-to-end model of the spectrograph to simulate the intensity distribution at the detector. We present an optical design for VIPER and highlight the potential of VIPA-based spectrographs for advancing exoplanetary science.</description>

      <title>CONAN: A Python package for modeling lightcurve and radial velocity data of exoplanetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CONAN (COde for exoplaNet ANalysis), an open-source Python package for comprehensive analyses of exoplanetary systems. It provides a unified Bayesian framework to simultaneously analyze diverse exoplanet datasets to derive global system parameters. CONAN allows to consistently model photometric transit light curves, occultations, phase curves, and radial velocity measurements, while detrending each dataset with any combination of parametric, sinusoidal, Gaussian Processes, and spline models.</description>

      <title>Removing atmospheric turbulence from ground-based astrometry with fast correlation function measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a code that removes $\sim 90\%$ of the variance in astrometric measurements caused by atmospheric turbulence, by using Gaussian process regression (GPR) to interpolate the turbulence field from the positions of stars measured by Gaia to the positions of arbitrary targets. This enables robust and routine accuracy of 1-3 milliarcsec on bright sources in single exposures of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For the kernel of the GPR, we use the anisotropic correlation function of the turbulent displacement field, as measured directly from the Gaia reference stars, which should yield optimal accuracy if the displacement field is Gaussian. We test the code on 26 simulated LSST exposures and 604 real DES exposures in varying conditions. The average correlation function of the astrometric errors for separations $&lt;1^{\prime}$ is used to estimate the variance of turbulence distortions. On average, for DES, the post-GPR variance is $\sim 12 \times$ smaller than the pre-GPR variance. Application of the GPR to LSST is hence equivalent, for brighter stars and asteroids, to having 12 Rubin observatories running simultaneously. The expected improvement in the RMS of turbulence displacement errors is the square root of this value, $\sim 3.5.$ The post-GPR RMS displacement decreases with the density of reference stars as $\sim n_\star^{-0.5}$ for noiseless LSST simulations, and $\sim n_\star^{-0.3}$ for DES data.</description>

      <title>Using Symbolic Regression to Emulate the Radial Fourier Transform of the S\'ersic profile for Fast, Accurate and Differentiable Galaxy Profile Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy profile fitting is a ubiquitous technique that provides the backbone for photometric and morphological measurements in modern extragalactic surveys. A recent innovation in profile fitting algorithms is to render, or create, the model profile in Fourier space, which aims to provide faster and more accurate results. However, the most common parameterization, the S\'ersic profile, has no closed form Fourier transform, requiring the use of computationally expensive approximations. In this paper our goal is to develop an emulator to mimic the radial Fourier transform of the S\'ersic profile, for use in profile fitting. We first numerically compute the radial Fourier transform and demonstrate that it varies smoothly as a function of the S\'ersic index and $k$, the spatial frequency coordinate. Using this set of numerically calculated transforms as a training set, we use symbolic regression to discover an equation which approximates its behavior. This ensures the emulator will be based on computationally efficient and differentiable building blocks. We implement this novel rendering method in the pysersic profile fitter, and ensure it is accurate by conducting both injection-recovery tests using model galaxy profiles and applying multiple rendering methods to a real sample of galaxies in HSC-SSP imaging. Crucially, the Fourier emulator rendering technique enables measurements of morphological parameters of galaxies 2.5 times faster than standard methods with minimal loss in accuracy. This increased performance while maintaining accuracy is a step that ensures these tools can continue to scale with the ever-increasing flow of incoming data.</description>

      <title>Flexible Spectral Separation of Multiple Isotropic and Anisotropic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe mHz gravitational waves from a wide variety of astrophysical sources. Of these, some will be characterizable as individual deterministic signals; the remainder will overlap to create astrophysical confusion noise. These sources of confusion noise are known as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). LISA data is expected to include several such astrophysical SGWBs, including the notable Galactic binary foreground, SGWBs from white dwarf binary populations in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binary black holes far from merger. To characterize these astrophysical signals and attempt to seek out possible underlying backgrounds of cosmological origin, it will be necessary to separate the contribution of each SGWB from that of the others. Crucially, several of these SGWBs are expected to be highly anisotropic on the sky, providing a powerful tool for spectral separation. To this end, we present BLIP 2.0: a flexible, GPU-accelerated framework for simulation and Bayesian analysis of arbitrary combinations of isotropic and anisotropic SGWBs. We leverage these capabilities to demonstrate for the first time spectral separation of the Galactic foreground, the Large Magellanic Cloud SGWB, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binaries, and show a proof-of-concept for placing upper limits on the detection of an underlying isotropic cosmological SGWB in the presence of multiple astrophysical foregrounds.</description>

      <title>Optimized Observation Sequencing in Low-Earth Orbit with the SPHEREx Survey Planning Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPHEREx is a NASA infrared astronomy mission that launched on March 12th, 2025 and is operating successfully in low-Earth orbit (LEO). The mission is currently observing the entire sky in 102 spectral channels in four independent all-sky surveys and also achieves enhanced coverage in two deep fields. This data will resolve key science questions about the early universe, galaxy formation, and the origin of water and biogenic molecules. In this paper, we describe the survey planning software (SPS) that enables SPHEREx to observe efficiently while mitigating a range of operational challenges in LEO. Our optimal target selection algorithm achieves the required high coverage in both the All-Sky and Deep Surveys. The algorithm plans observations to stay within our time-varying allowable pointing zone, interleaves required data downlink passes, and mitigates outages due to the South Atlantic Anomaly and other events. As demonstrated by the sky coverage achieved in the first SPHEREx public data release, our approach is performing well in flight. The SPHEREx SPS is a key new capability that enables the mission to deliver groundbreaking science from LEO.</description>

      <title>Diamond-loaded polyimide aerogel scattering filters and their applications in astrophysical and planetary science observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared-blocking, aerogel-based scattering filters have a broad range of potential applications in astrophysics and planetary science instruments in the far-infrared, sub-millimeter, and microwave regimes. This paper demonstrates the ability of conductively-loaded, polyimide aerogel filters to meet the mechanical and science instrument requirements for several experiments, including the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), the Experiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM), and the Sub-millimeter Solar Observation Lunar Volatiles Experiment (SSOLVE). Thermal multi-physics simulations of the filters predict their performance when integrated into a cryogenic receiver. Prototype filters have survived cryogenic cycling to 4\,K with no degradation in mechanical properties. Measurement of total hemispherical reflectance and transmittance, as well as cryogenic tests of the aerogel filters in a full receiver context, allow estimates of the integrated infrared emissivity of the filters. Knowledge of the emissivity will help instrument designers incorporate the filters into future experiments in planetary science, astrophysics, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>High performance visualization for Astronomy and Cosmology: the VisIVO's pathway toward Exascale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Petabyte-scale data volumes are generated by observations and simulations in modern astronomy and astrophysics. Storage, access, and data analysis are significantly hampered by such data volumes and are leading to the development of a new generation of software tools. The Visualization Interface for the Virtual Observatory (VisIVO) has been designed, developed and maintained by INAF since 2005 to perform multi-dimensional data analysis and knowledge discovery in multivariate astrophysical datasets. Utilizing containerization and virtualization technologies, VisIVO has already been used to exploit distributed computing infrastructures including the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).
  We intend to adapt VisIVO solutions for high performance visualization of data generated on the (pre-)Exascale systems by HPC applications in Astrophysics and Cosmology (A\&amp;C), including GADGET (GAlaxies with Dark matter and Gas) and PLUTO simulations, thanks to the collaboration within the SPACE Center of Excellence, the H2020 EUPEX Project, and the ICSC National Research Centre. In this work, we outline the evolution's course as well as the execution strategies designed to achieve the following goals: enhance the portability of the VisIVO modular applications and their resource requirements; foster reproducibility and maintainability; take advantage of a more flexible resource exploitation over heterogeneous HPC facilities; and, finally, minimize data-movement overheads and improve I/O performances.</description>

      <title>On the Transients Handler for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation gamma-ray observatory in both the Southern (Paranal, Chile) and Northern Hemisphere (La Palma, Spain) and will consist of up to 100 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. With sensitivity far exceeding current facilities, CTAO will provide detailed measurements of gamma rays from GeV up to a few 100s of TeV. CTAO has a nominal field of view of 10{\deg} and will rely on external alerts from observatories such as IceCube (neutrinos), Fermi-LAT (GeV gamma rays), LIGO (gravitational waves (GWs)) or the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory (optical) to trigger observations of targets of opportunity (ToOs). The Transients Handler (TH) is a subsystem of the Array Control and Data Acquisition that will provide the means of handling alerts and schedule follow-up observations. The TH is responsible for (i) filtering of thousands of internal and external alerts per night, (ii) processing of alerts according to the corresponding observation proposal to determine the optimal observation schedule with minimum interruptions to observations and (iii) broadcasting of events detected by CTAO to external facilities. In this work, we will discuss the architecture of the Transients Handler, its latest improvements and future updates</description>

      <title>Broadband spectroscopy of astrophysical ice analogues: III. Scattering properties and porosity of CO and CO$_2$ ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $Context.$ The quantification of the terahertz (THz) and IR optical properties of astrophysical ice analogs, which have different molecular compositions, phases, and structural properties, is required to model both the continuum emission by the dust grains covered with thick icy mantles and the radiative transfer in the dense cold regions of the interstellar medium.
  $Aims.$ We developed a model to define a relationship between the THz$-$IR response and the ice porosity. It includes the reduced effective optical properties of porous ices and the additional wave extinction due to scattering on pores. The model is applied to analyze the measured THz$-$IR response of CO and CO$_2$ laboratory ices and to estimate their scattering properties and porosity.
  $Methods.$ Our model combines the Bruggeman effective medium theory, the Lorentz-Mie and Rayleigh scattering theories, and the radiative transfer theory to analyze the measured THz$-$IR optical properties of laboratory ices.
  $Results.$ We apply this model to show that the electromagnetic-wave scattering in studied laboratory ices occurs mainly in the Rayleigh regime at frequencies below 32 THz. We conclude that pores of different shapes and dimensions can be approximated by spheres of effective radius. By comparing the measured broadband response of our laboratory ices with those of reportedly compact ices from earlier studies, we quantify the scattering properties of our CO and CO$_2$ ice samples. Their porosity is shown to be as high as 15% and 22%, respectively. Underestimating the ice porosity in the data analysis leads to a proportional relative underestimate of the THz$-$IR optical constants.
  $Conclusions.$ The scattering properties and porosity of ices have to be quantified along with their THz$-$IR response in order to adequately interpret astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter 2025 Proceedings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third ``Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter'' (MD$\nu$DM'25) meeting was held May 20-23, 2025 in Yokohama, Japan, hosted by the Yokohama Institute for Earth Sciences, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). These proceedings compile contributions from the workshop and update the progress of mineral detector research. MD$\nu$DM'25 was the third such meeting, following the first in October of 2022 held at the IFPU in Trieste, Italy and the second in January of 2024 hosted by the Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Arlington, USA. Mineral detectors record and retain damage induced by nuclear recoils in synthetic or natural mineral samples. The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and micro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales relevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and dark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as the energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors which record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small mineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by astrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A series of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution of these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system and the Milky Way. Mineral detector research is highly multidisciplinary, incorporating aspects of high energy physics, condensed matter physics, materials science, geoscience, and AI/ML for data analysis. Although realizing the scientific potential of mineral detectors poses many challenges, the MD$\nu$DM community looks forward to the continued development of mineral detector experiments and the possible discoveries that mineral detectors could reveal.</description>

      <title>On fine alignment of transmitted beams for TianQin with far-field wavefront error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational wave detector mission that employs inter-satellite laser interferometry. Suppressing measurement noise and achieving high sensitivity require accurate alignment of multiple onboard interferometers after laser link acquisition. However, due to huge armlengths and varying point-ahead angles, the fine alignment of the transmitted beams can be particularly challenging, which needs to take into account both received laser power and far-field wavefront errors. To tackle this issue for TianQin which has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment strategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the transmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated through a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding intensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value compensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad from the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length coupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement given a transmitted beam aberration of $\lambda/40$ RMS.</description>

      <title>Update of the CODE catalogue and some aspects of the dynamical status of Oort Cloud comets</title>

Abstract: Context. The outer Solar System is believed to host a vast reservoir of long-period comets (LPCs), but our understanding of their spatial distribution and dynamical history remains limited due to observational biases and uncertainties in orbital solutions for really observed comets. Aims. We aim to provide a comprehensive and dynamically homogeneous orbital database of LPCs to support the study of their origin, evolution, dynamical status, and 6D distribution of orbital elements. Methods. We updated the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits and their Dynamical Evolution (CODE catalogue) by computing original and future barycentric orbits, orbital parameters at previous and next perihelion, using full Monte Carlo swarms of real comets for the uncertainties estimation and taking into account the planetary, Galactic and passing stars perturbations according to the latest data and algorithms. Results. This update of the CODE catalogue focuses on the dynamical status of near-parabolic comets. Using current stellar data, we formulate new constraints for dynamically new comets. Now, the CODE database includes 983 orbital solutions for 369 comets with full uncertainty estimates and dynamical classifications, covering nearly all comets with original semi-major axes exceeding 10,000 au and discovered before 2022, as well as all LPCs discovered beyond 10 au from the Sun during during this period, and over 80% of the known LPCs with perihelion distances beyond 7 au.</description>

      <title>Procedures for Constraining Robotic Fiber Positioning for Highly Multiplexed Spectroscopic Surveys: The Case of FPS for SDSS-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One crucial aspect of planning any large scale astronomical survey is constructing an observing strategy that maximizes reduced data quality. This is especially important for surveys that are rather heterogeneous and broad-ranging in their science goals. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V), which now utilizes the Focal Plane System (FPS) to robotically place fibers that feed the spectrographs, certainly meets these criteria. The addition of the FPS facilities an increase in survey efficiency, number of targets and target diversity, but also means the positions of fibers must be constrained to allow for simultaneous observations of sometimes competing programs. The constraints on the positions of the fibers are clearly driven by properties of the science targets e.g., the type of target, brightness of the target, position of the target relative to others in the field, etc. The parameters used to describe these constraints will also depend on the intended science goal of the observation, which will vary with the types of objects requested for the particular observation and the planned sky conditions for the observation. In this work, we detail the SDSS-V data collection scenarios, which consist of sets of parameters that serve as the framework for constraining fiber placements. The numerical values of these parameters were set based on either past experiences or from a series of new tests, which we describe in detail here. These parameters allow a survey like SDSS-V to be algorithmically planned to maximize the science output, while guaranteeing data quality throughout its operation.</description>

      <title>Second MAYA Catalog of Binary Black Hole Numerical Relativity Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical relativity waveforms are a critical resource in the quest to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of, and gravitational waves emitted from, merging binary systems. We present 181 new numerical relativity simulations as the second MAYA catalog of binary black hole waveforms (a sequel to the Georgia Tech waveform catalog). Most importantly, these include 55 high mass ratio (q &gt;= 4), 48 precessing, and 92 eccentric (e &gt; 0.01) simulations, including seven simulations which are both eccentric and precessing. With these significant additions, this new catalog fills in considerable gaps in existing public numerical relativity waveform catalogs. The waveforms presented in this catalog are shown to be convergent and are consistent with current gravitational wave models. They are available to the public at https://cgpstorage.ph.utexas.edu/waveforms.</description>

      <title>GWSpace: a multi-mission science data simulator for space-based gravitational wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin, LISA, and TaiJi have the potential to outperform themselves through joint observation. To achieve this, it is desirable to practice joint data analysis in advance on simulated data that encodes the intrinsic correlation among the signals found in different detectors that operate simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce GWSpace, a package that can simulate the joint detection data from TianQin, LISA, and TaiJi. The software is not a groundbreaking work that starts from scratch. Rather, we use as many open-source resources as possible, tailoring them to the needs of simulating the multi-mission science data and putting everything into a ready-to-go and easy-to-use package. We shall describe the main components, the construction, and a few examples of application of the package. A common coordinate system, namely the Solar System Barycenter (SSB) coordinate system, is utilized to calculate spacecraft orbits for all three missions. The paper also provides a brief derivation of the detection process and outlines the general waveform of sources detectable by these detectors.</description>

      <title>A New Search Pipeline for Short Gamma Ray Bursts in Fermi/GBM Data -- A 50% Increase in the Number of Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the development and the results of a new search pipeline for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in the publicly available data from the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi satellite. This pipeline uses rigorous statistical methods that are designed to maximize the information extracted from the Fermi/GBM detectors. Our approach differs substantially from existing search efforts in several aspects: The pipeline includes the construction of template banks, Poisson matched filtering, background estimation, background misestimation correction, automatic routines to filter contaminants, statistical estimation of the signal location and a quantitative estimator of the signal probability to be of a cosmological, terrestrial, or solar origin. Our analysis also includes operating the pipeline on "time-slided" copies of the data, which allows exact significance assessment and $p_{\text{astro}}$ computation, akin to the state-of-the-art gravitational waves (GW) data analysis pipelines. Depending on the spectral properties of the bursts, our pipeline achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement by a factor of 2 to 15 over the onboard GBM triggering algorithm. This enhancement increases the detectable volume for sGRBs and results in an approximate 50% increase in sGRB detections in the 2014 GBM dataset. As a further consequence of the sensitivity increase, we detect hundreds of soft gamma-ray flares of galactic origin. This improved sensitivity enhances the chances of detecting fainter, off-axis GRBs that would likely fall below the standard triggering thresholds. Applying this pipeline to the full GBM archive is expected to expand further the joint sGRB-GW detection volume.</description>

      <title>Automated Algorithmic Discovery for Gravitational-Wave Detection Guided by LLM-Informed Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave signal detection with unknown source parameters buried in dynamic detector noise remains a formidable computational challenge. Existing approaches face core limitations from restrictive assumptions: traditional methods rely on predefined theoretical priors, while neural networks introduce hidden biases and lack interpretability. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), the first integration of large language model (LLM) guidance with domain-aware physical constraints for automated gravitational wave detection. This framework systematically explores algorithmic solution spaces through tree-structured search enhanced by evolutionary optimization, combining MCTS for strategic exploration with evolutionary algorithms for solution refinement. The LLM component provides domain-aware heuristics while maintaining interpretability through explicit algorithmic pathway generation. Experimental validation demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving a 20.2% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset and a remarkable 59.1% improvement over other LLM-based algorithm optimization frameworks. Beyond performance improvements, our framework establishes a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.</description>

      <title>Prospects for dark matter observations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dSphs around the Milky Way are commonly considered as systems that are supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravitation. They have been long accounted among the best targets to search for indirect DM signatures in the GeV-to-TeV gamma-rays due to absence of astrophysical gamma-ray foreground or background emission. We present forecasts on the sensitivity of the future CTAO for the search for annihilating or decaying DM in such targets. We perform an original selection of candidates out of the current catalog of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint targets. For each of them, we calculate the expected amount of DM using the most updated and complete available samples of photometric and spectroscopic data of member stars, adopting a common framework of data treatment for both classes of objects. In this way, we are able to generate novel astrophysical factor profiles for general indirect DM searches that we compare with the current literature. Out of a starting sample of 64 dSphs, we highlight the 8 most promising targets - DraI, CBe, UMaII, UMi and Wil1 in the Northern hemisphere; RetII, Scl and SgrII in the Southern hemisphere - for which different DM density models (either cored or cuspy) lead to similar expectations, at variance with what happens for other DM targets - thus resulting in more robust predictions. We find that CTAO will provide the strongest limits above ~10 TeV, down to values of velocity-averaged annihilation cross section of ~5$ \times 10^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and up to decay lifetimes of ~10$^{26}$ s for combined limits on the best targets. We argue that the largest source of inaccuracy is due to the still imprecise determination of the DM content, especially for ultra-faint dSphs. We propose possible strategies of observation for CTAO, either optimized on a deep focus on the best known candidates, or on the diversification of targets.</description>
