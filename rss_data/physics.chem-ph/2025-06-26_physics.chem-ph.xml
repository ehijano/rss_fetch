      <title>Simulating one hundred entangled atoms using projected-interacting full configuration interaction wavefunctions corrected by projected density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating entangled atoms is a prerequisite to modeling quantum materials and remains an outstanding challenge for theory. I introduce a correlated wavefunction approach capable of simulating large entangled systems, and demonstrate its application to a 300-electron active space. Projected-interacting full configuration interaction plus density functional theory PiFCI+DFT combines near-exact correlated wavefunctions of multiple partially-interacting model systems, each corrected by a formally exact density functional. This approach can access large active spaces and visualize entanglement and strong correlation while maintaining competitive accuracy for molecular properties.</description>

      <title>An ab initio foundation model of wavefunctions that accurately describes chemical bond breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable description of bond breaking remains a major challenge for quantum chemistry due to the multireferential character of the electronic structure in dissociating species. Multireferential methods in particular suffer from large computational cost, which under the normal paradigm has to be paid anew for each system at a full price, ignoring commonalities in electronic structure across molecules. Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC) uniquely offers to exploit such commonalities by pretraining transferable wavefunction models, but all such attempts were so far limited in scope. Here, we bring this new paradigm to fruition with Orbformer, a novel transferable wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 equilibrium and dissociating structures that can be fine-tuned on unseen molecules reaching an accuracy-cost ratio rivalling classical multireferential methods. On established benchmarks as well as more challenging bond dissociations and Diels-Alder reactions, Orbformer is the only method that consistently converges to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). This work turns the idea of amortizing the cost of solving the Schr\"odinger equation over many molecules into a practical approach in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Impact of the damping function in dispersion-corrected density functional theory on the properties of liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accounting for dispersion interactions is essential in approximate density functional theory (DFT). Often, a correction potential based on the London formula is added, which is damped at short distances to avoid divergence and double counting of interactions treated locally by the exchange-correlation functional. Most commonly, two forms of damping, known as zero- and Becke-Johnson (BJ)-damping, are employed and it is generally assumed that the choice has only a minor impact on performance even though the resulting correction potentials differ quite dramatically. Recent studies have cast doubt on this assumption pointing to a significant effect of damping for liquid water, but the underlying reasons have not yet been investigated. Here, we analyze this effect in detail for the widely used Tkatchenko-Scheffler and DFT-D3 dispersion models. We demonstrate that, regardless of the dispersion model, both types of damping perform equally well for interaction energies of water clusters, but find that for the two investigated functionals zero-damping outperforms BJ-damping in dynamic simulations of liquid water. Compared to BJ-damping, zero-damping provides, e.g., an improved structural description, self-diffusion, and density of liquid water. This can be explained by the repulsive gradient at small distances resulting from damping to zero that artificially destabilizes water's tetrahedral hydrogen-bonding network. Therefore, zero-damping can compensate for deficiencies often observed for generalized gradient functionals, which is not possible for strictly attractive BJ-damping. Consequently, the improvement that can be achieved by applying a dispersion correction strongly depends on the employed damping function suggesting that the role of damping in dispersion-corrected DFT needs to be generally reevaluated.</description>

      <title>Parameterization and benchmarking of the Modified Marrone-Treanor Model for five-species air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated parameters for five-species air to be used with the Modified Marrone-Treanor (MMT) air dissociation model. The vibrational relaxation and chemical reaction rates are derived from quasiclassical trajectory calculation (QCT) and direct molecular simulation (DMS) using ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). The resulting model and parameter set enable efficient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of high-temperature nonequilibrium five-species air (N2, O2, NO, N and O). Through a consistent comparison, we show that the MMT model reproduces DMS benchmark solutions with high accuracy in zero-dimensional heat bath simulations representative of thermochemical nonequilibrium post-shock conditions. The MMT model's analytical expressions for dissociation rate coefficient and vibrational energy change per reaction ensure that the correct amount of energy is transferred between the vibrational and trans-rotational modes. Detailed balance is imposed for three-body recombination reactions and MMT solutions exhibit both quasi-steady-state (QSS) dissociation rates and proper approach to thermochemical equilibrium. MMT model predictions are compared to the Park two-temperature model for similar heat bath conditions. MMT predicts significantly slower conversion of N2 into N below 10000 K and significantly more NO production at all temperatures.</description>

      <title>Taylor-mode automatic differentiation for constructing molecular rovibrational Hamiltonian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20129v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an automated framework for constructing Taylor series expansions of rovibrational kinetic and potential energy operators for arbitrary molecules, internal coordinate systems, and molecular frame embedding conditions. Expressing operators in a sum-of-products form allows for computationally efficient evaluations of matrix elements in product basis sets. Our approach uses automatic differentiation tools from the Python machine learning ecosystem, particularly the JAX library, to efficiently and accurately generate high-order Taylor expansions of rovibrational operators. The implementation is available at https://github.com/robochimps/vibrojet.</description>

      <title>STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator (STACIE): Robust and accurate transport properties from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: STACIE (STable AutoCorrelation Integral Estimator) is a novel algorithm and Python package that delivers robust, uncertainty-aware estimates of autocorrelation integrals from time-correlated data. While its primary application is deriving transport properties from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, STACIE is equally applicable to time-correlated data in other scientific fields. A key feature of STACIE is its ability to provide robust and accurate estimates without requiring manual adjustment of hyperparameters. Additionally, one can follow a simple protocol to prepare sufficient simulation data to achieve a desired relative error of the transport property. We demonstrate its application by estimating the ionic electrical conductivity of a NaCl-water electrolyte solution. We also present a massive synthetic benchmark dataset to rigorously validate STACIE, comprising 15360 sets of time-correlated inputs generated with diverse covariance kernels with known autocorrelation integrals. STACIE is open source and available on GitHub and PyPI, with comprehensive documentation and examples.</description>

      <title>How to use quantum computers for biomolecular free energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free energy calculations are at the heart of physics-based analyses of biochemical processes. They allow us to quantify molecular recognition mechanisms, which determine a wide range of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations require computational models that accurately capture both the varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules. Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target, applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods scale unfavorable with system size, we analyze requirements for quantum computers to provide highly accurate energies that impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate machine learning to model large molecules.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, and at the base of extensive molecular and materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in chemistry and materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r r2SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r2SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r2SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r2SCANY@r2SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r2SCANY@r2SCANX utilizes different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r2SCANY@r2SCANX enhances the r2SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+U method. The O2 overbinding in r2SCAN (~0.3 eV/O2) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r2SCAN10@r2SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r2SCAN10@r2SCAN50, minimizing r2SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r2SCAN10@r2SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r2SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r2SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r2SCAN10@r2SCAN, which is 10 to 300 times faster than r2SCAN10.</description>
