      <title>Wait to be Faster: a Smart Pooling Framework for Dynamic Ridesharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ridesharing services, such as Uber or Didi, have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their positive impact on environmental protection and the economy. Existing studies require quick responses to orders, which lack the flexibility to accommodate longer wait times for better grouping opportunities. In this paper, we address a NP-hard ridesharing problem, called Minimal Extra Time RideSharing (METRS), which balances waiting time and group quality (i.e., detour time) to improve riders' satisfaction. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach called WATTER (WAit To be fasTER), which leverages an order pooling management algorithm allowing orders to wait until they can be matched with suitable groups. The key challenge is to customize the extra time threshold for each order by reducing the original optimization objective into a convex function of threshold, thus offering a theoretical guarantee to be optimized efficiently. We model the dispatch process using a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a carefully designed value function to learn the threshold. Through extensive experiments on three real datasets, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>Exploring Distance Query Processing in Edge Computing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of changing travel behaviors and the expanding user base of Geographic Information System (GIS) services, conventional centralized architectures responsible for handling shortest distance queries are facing increasing challenges, such as heightened load pressure and longer response times. To mitigate these concerns, this study is the first to develop an edge computing framework specially tailored for processing distance queries. In conjunction with this innovative system, we have developed a straightforward, yet effective, labeling technique termed Border Labeling. Furthermore, we have devised and implemented a range of query strategies intended to capitalize on the capabilities of the edge computing infrastructure. Our experiments demonstrate that our solution surpasses other methods in terms of both indexing time and query speed across various road network datasets. The empirical evidence from our experiments supports the claim that our edge computing architecture significantly reduces the latency encountered by end-users, thus markedly decreasing their waiting times.</description>

      <title>Graph Theory for Consent Management: A New Approach for Complex Data Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through legislation and technical advances users gain more control over how their data is processed, and they expect online services to respect their privacy choices and preferences. However, data may be processed for many different purposes by several layers of algorithms that create complex data workflows. To date, there is no existing approach to automatically satisfy fine-grained privacy constraints of a user in a way which optimises the service provider's gains from processing. In this article, we propose a solution to this problem by modelling a data flow as a graph. User constraints and processing purposes are pairs of vertices which need to be disconnected in this graph. In general, this problem is NP-hard, thus, we propose several heuristics and algorithms. We discuss the optimality versus efficiency of our algorithms and evaluate them using synthetically generated data. On the practical side, our algorithms can provide nearly optimal solutions for tens of constraints and graphs of thousands of nodes, in a few seconds.</description>

      <title>Models for Storage in Database Backends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes ongoing work on developing a formal specification of a database backend. We present the formalisation of the expected behaviour of a basic transactional system that calls into a simple store API, and instantiate in two semantic models. The first one is a map-based, classical versioned key-value store; the second one, journal-based, appends individual transaction effects to a journal. We formalise a significant part of the specification in the Coq proof assistant. This work will form the basis for a formalisation of a full-fledged backend store with features such as caching or write-ahead logging, as variations on maps and journals.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Analytical Query Processing in Intel SGXv2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced second generation of Intel SGX (SGXv2) lifts memory size limitations of the first generation. Theoretically, this promises to enable secure and highly efficient analytical DBMSs in the cloud. To validate this promise, in this paper, we conduct the first in-depth evaluation study of running analytical query processing algorithms inside SGXv2. Our study reveals that state-of-the-art query operators like radix joins and SIMD-based scans can indeed achieve high performance inside SGXv2 enclaves. These operations are orders of magnitude faster than joins optimized for the discontinued SGXv1 hardware. However, substantial performance overheads are still caused by subtle hardware and software differences influencing code execution inside an SGX enclave. We investigate these differences and propose new optimizations to bring the performance inside the enclave on par with native code execution outside an enclave.</description>

      <title>Vector search with small radiuses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the dominant accuracy metric for vector search is the recall of a result list of fixed size (top-k retrieval), considering as ground truth the exact vector retrieval results. Although convenient to compute, this metric is distantly related to the end-to-end accuracy of a full system that integrates vector search. In this paper we focus on the common case where a hard decision needs to be taken depending on the vector retrieval results, for example, deciding whether a query image matches a database image or not. We solve this as a range search task, where all vectors within a certain radius from the query are returned.
  We show that the value of a range search result can be modeled rigorously based on the query-to-vector distance. This yields a metric for range search, RSM, that is both principled and easy to compute without running an end-to-end evaluation. We apply this metric to the case of image retrieval. We show that indexing methods that are adapted for top-k retrieval do not necessarily maximize the RSM. In particular, for inverted file based indexes, we show that visiting a limited set of clusters and encoding vectors compactly yields near optimal results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many programming frameworks have been introduced to support the development of differentially private software applications. In this chapter, we survey some of the conceptual ideas underlying these frameworks in a way that we hope will be helpful for both practitioners and researchers. For practitioners, the survey can provide a starting point for understanding what features may be valuable when selecting a programming framework. For researchers, it can help organize existing work in a unified way and provide context for understanding new features in future frameworks.</description>

      <title>Lion: Minimizing Distributed Transactions through Adaptive Replica Provision (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed transaction processing often involves multiple rounds of cross-node communications, and therefore tends to be slow. To improve performance, existing approaches convert distributed transactions into single-node transactions by either migrating co-accessed partitions onto the same nodes or establishing a super node housing replicas of the entire database. However, migration-based methods might cause transactions to be blocked due to waiting for data migration, while the super node can become a bottleneck. In this paper, we present Lion, a novel transaction processing protocol that utilizes partition-based replication to reduce the occurrence of distributed transactions. Lion aims to assign a node with one replica from each partition involved in a given transaction's read or write operations. To ensure such a node is available, we propose an adaptive replica provision mechanism, enhanced with an LSTM-based workload prediction algorithm, to determine the appropriate node for locating replicas of co-accessed partitions. The adaptation of replica placement is conducted preemptively and asynchronously, thereby minimizing its impact on performance. By employing this adaptive replica placement strategy, we ensure that the majority of transactions can be efficiently processed on a single node without additional overhead. Only a small fraction of transactions will need to be treated as regular distributed transactions when such a node is unavailable. Consequently, Lion effectively minimizes distributed transactions while avoiding any disruption caused by data migration or the creation of a super node. We conduct extensive experiments to compare Lion against various transaction processing protocols. The results show that Lion achieves up to 2.7x higher throughput and 76.4% better scalability against these state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Automated data processing and feature engineering for deep learning and big data applications: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern approach to artificial intelligence (AI) aims to design algorithms that learn directly from data. This approach has achieved impressive results and has contributed significantly to the progress of AI, particularly in the sphere of supervised deep learning. It has also simplified the design of machine learning systems as the learning process is highly automated. However, not all data processing tasks in conventional deep learning pipelines have been automated. In most cases data has to be manually collected, preprocessed and further extended through data augmentation before they can be effective for training. Recently, special techniques for automating these tasks have emerged. The automation of data processing tasks is driven by the need to utilize large volumes of complex, heterogeneous data for machine learning and big data applications. Today, end-to-end automated data processing systems based on automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques are capable of taking raw data and transforming them into useful features for Big Data tasks by automating all intermediate processing stages. In this work, we present a thorough review of approaches for automating data processing tasks in deep learning pipelines, including automated data preprocessing--e.g., data cleaning, labeling, missing data imputation, and categorical data encoding--as well as data augmentation (including synthetic data generation using generative AI methods) and feature engineering--specifically, automated feature extraction, feature construction and feature selection. In addition to automating specific data processing tasks, we discuss the use of AutoML methods and tools to simultaneously optimize all stages of the machine learning pipeline.</description>

      <title>Accelerating String-Key Learned Index Structures via Memoization-based Incremental Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned indexes use machine learning models to learn the mappings between keys and their corresponding positions in key-value indexes. These indexes use the mapping information as training data. Learned indexes require frequent retrainings of their models to incorporate the changes introduced by update queries. To efficiently retrain the models, existing learned index systems often harness a linear algebraic QR factorization technique that performs matrix decomposition. This factorization approach processes all key-position pairs during each retraining, resulting in compute operations that grow linearly with the total number of keys and their lengths. Consequently, the retrainings create a severe performance bottleneck, especially for variable-length string keys, while the retrainings are crucial for maintaining high prediction accuracy and in turn, ensuring low query service latency.
  To address this performance problem, we develop an algorithm-hardware co-designed string-key learned index system, dubbed SIA. In designing SIA, we leverage a unique algorithmic property of the matrix decomposition-based training method. Exploiting the property, we develop a memoization-based incremental training scheme, which only requires computation over updated keys, while decomposition results of non-updated keys from previous computations can be reused. We further enhance SIA to offload a portion of this training process to an FPGA accelerator to not only relieve CPU resources for serving index queries (i.e., inference), but also accelerate the training itself. Our evaluation shows that compared to ALEX, LIPP, and SIndex, a state-of-the-art learned index systems, SIA-accelerated learned indexes offer 2.6x and 3.4x higher throughput on the two real-world benchmark suites, YCSB and Twitter cache trace, respectively.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh Agricultural Knowledge Graph: Enabling Semantic Integration and Data-driven Analysis--Full Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bangladesh, agriculture is a crucial driver for addressing Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) and 2 (Zero Hunger), playing a fundamental role in the economy and people's livelihoods. To enhance the sustainability and resilience of the agriculture industry through data-driven insights, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and other organizations consistently collect and publish agricultural data on the Web. Nevertheless, the current datasets encounter various challenges: 1) they are presented in an unsustainable, static, read-only, and aggregated format, 2) they do not conform to the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles, and 3) they do not facilitate interactive analysis and integration with other data sources. In this paper, we present a thorough solution, delineating a systematic procedure for developing BDAKG: a knowledge graph that semantically and analytically integrates agriculture data in Bangladesh. BDAKG incorporates multidimensional semantics, is linked with external knowledge graphs, is compatible with OLAP, and adheres to the FAIR principles. Our experimental evaluation centers on evaluating the integration process and assessing the quality of the resultant knowledge graph in terms of completeness, timeliness, FAIRness, OLAP compatibility and data-driven analysis. Our federated data analysis recommend a strategic approach focused on decreasing CO$_2$ emissions, fostering economic growth, and promoting sustainable forestry.</description>

      <title>Exploring Estonia's Open Government Data Development as a Journey towards Excellence: Unveiling the Progress of Local Governments in Open Data Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estonia has a global reputation of a digital state or e-country. However, despite the success in digital governance, the country has faced challenges in the realm of Open Government Data (OGD) area, with significant advancements in its OGD ecosystem, as reflected in various open data rankings from 2020 and onwards, in the recent years being recognized among trend-setters. This paper aims to explore the evolution and positioning of Estonia's OGD development, encompassing national and local levels, through an integrated analysis of various indices, primary data from the Estonian OGD portal, and a thorough literature review. The research shows that Estonia has made progress in the national level open data ecosystem, primarily due to improvements in the OGD portal usability and legislation amendments. However, the local level is not as developed, with local governments lagging behind in OGD provision. The literature review highlights the lack of previous research focusing on Estonian and European local open data, emphasizing the need for future studies to explore the barriers and enablers of municipal OGD. This study contributes to a nuanced understanding of Estonia's dynamic journey in the OGD landscape, shedding light on both achievements and areas warranting further attention for establishing a sustainable open data ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Spatialyze: A Geospatial Video Analytics System with Spatial-Aware Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Videos that are shot using commodity hardware such as phones and surveillance cameras record various metadata such as time and location. We encounter such geospatial videos on a daily basis and such videos have been growing in volume significantly. Yet, we do not have data management systems that allow users to interact with such data effectively.
  In this paper, we describe Spatialyze, a new framework for end-to-end querying of geospatial videos. Spatialyze comes with a domain-specific language where users can construct geospatial video analytic workflows using a 3-step, declarative, build-filter-observe paradigm. Internally, Spatialyze leverages the declarative nature of such workflows, the temporal-spatial metadata stored with videos, and physical behavior of real-world objects to optimize the execution of workflows. Our results using real-world videos and workflows show that Spatialyze can reduce execution time by up to 5.3x, while maintaining up to 97.1% accuracy compared to unoptimized execution.</description>

      <title>A Polystore Architecture Using Knowledge Graphs to Support Queries on Heterogeneous Data Stores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern applications commonly need to manage dataset types composed of heterogeneous data and schemas, making it difficult to access them in an integrated way. A single data store to manage heterogeneous data using a common data model is not effective in such a scenario, which results in the domain data being fragmented in the data stores that best fit their storage and access requirements (e.g., NoSQL, relational DBMS, or HDFS). Besides, organization workflows independently consume these fragments, and usually, there is no explicit link among the fragments that would be useful to support an integrated view. The research challenge tackled by this work is to provide the means to query heterogeneous data residing on distinct data repositories that are not explicitly connected. We propose a federated database architecture by providing a single abstract global conceptual schema to users, allowing them to write their queries, encapsulating data heterogeneity, location, and linkage by employing: (i) meta-models to represent the global conceptual schema, the remote data local conceptual schemas, and mappings among them; (ii) provenance to create explicit links among the consumed and generated data residing in separate datasets. We evaluated the architecture through its implementation as a polystore service, following a microservice architecture approach, in a scenario that simulates a real case in Oil \&amp; Gas industry. Also, we compared the proposed architecture to a relational multidatabase system based on foreign data wrappers, measuring the user's cognitive load to write a query (or query complexity) and the query processing time. The results demonstrated that the proposed architecture allows query writing two times less complex than the one written for the relational multidatabase system, adding an excess of no more than 30% in query processing time.</description>

      <title>VeriEQL: Bounded Equivalence Verification for Complex SQL Queries with Integrity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of SQL query equivalence checking is important in various real-world applications (including query rewriting and automated grading) that involve complex queries with integrity constraints; yet, state-of-the-art techniques are very limited in their capability of reasoning about complex features (e.g., those that involve sorting, case statement, rich integrity constraints, etc.) in real-life queries. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first SMT-based approach and its implementation, VeriEQL, capable of proving and disproving bounded equivalence of complex SQL queries. VeriEQL is based on a new logical encoding that models query semantics over symbolic tuples using the theory of integers with uninterpreted functions. It is simple yet highly practical -- our comprehensive evaluation on over 20,000 benchmarks shows that VeriEQL outperforms all state-of-the-art techniques by more than one order of magnitude in terms of the number of benchmarks that can be proved or disproved. VeriEQL can also generate counterexamples that facilitate many downstream tasks (such as finding serious bugs in systems like MySQL and Apache Calcite).</description>

Abstract: With the proliferation of spatio-textual data, Top-k KNN spatial keyword queries (TkQs), which return a list of objects based on a ranking function that evaluates both spatial and textual relevance, have found many real-life applications. Existing geo-textual indexes for TkQs use traditional retrieval models like BM25 to compute text relevance and usually exploit a simple linear function to compute spatial relevance, but its effectiveness is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues. To the best of our knowledge, there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models.
  To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST). LIST is featured with two novel components. Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline.</description>
