      <title>Explaining ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$ in the context of their environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The swift assembly of the earliest galaxies poses a significant challenge to our understanding of galaxy formation. Ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts ($3 &lt; z &lt; 5$) currently present one of the most pressing problems for theoretical modeling, since very few mechanisms can be invoked to explain how such galaxies formed so early in the history of the Universe. Here, we exploit the fact that these galaxies all reside within significant overdensities to explain their masses. To this end, we construct and release a modified version of the Extreme Value Statistics (EVS) code which takes into account galaxy environment by incorporating clustering in the calculation. With this new version of EVS, we find that ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;5$ do not present as serious a tension with simple models of galaxy formation when the analysis of a given galaxy is conditioned on its environment.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Supernova Feedback on Satellites in Elliptical Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of supernova (SN) feedback on the satellites of elliptical host galaxies using hydrodynamic simulations. Utilizing a modified version of the GADGET-3 code, we perform cosmological zoom-in simulations of 11 elliptical galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{11} M_{\odot} &lt; M_{*} &lt; 2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We conduct two sets of simulations with identical initial conditions: the Fiducial model, which includes a three-phase SN mechanical wind, and the weak SN feedback model, where nearly all SN energy is released as thermal energy with a reduced SN wind velocity. Our comparison shows minimal differences in the elliptical host galaxies, but significant variations in the physical properties of satellite galaxies. The weak SN feedback model produces a larger number of satellite galaxies compared to the Fiducial model, and significantly more than observed. For satellite galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$, the weak SN feedback model generates approximately five times more satellites than observed in the xSAGA survey. Most of these overproduced satellites have small stellar masses, below $10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, satellites in the weak SN feedback model are about 3.5 times more compact than those observed in the SAGA survey and the Fiducial model, with metallicities nearly 1 dex higher than observed values. In conclusion, the satellite galaxies in the Fiducial model, which includes mechanical SN feedback, exhibit properties more closely aligned with observations. This underscores the necessity of incorporating both mechanical AGN and SN feedback to reproduce the observed properties of elliptical galaxy and their satellites in simulations.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI/MRS observations of hot molecular gas in an AGN host galaxy at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to play a central role in quenching star formation by removing or destroying molecular gas from host galaxies via radiation-pressure driven outflows and/or radio jets. Some studies of cold molecular gas in galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$) show that AGN have less cold gas ($&lt;$100 K) compared to mass-matched star-forming galaxies. However, cold gas could also be shock-heated to warmer phases, detectable via H$_{2}$ transitions in the rest-frame near- and mid-infrared spectra. The Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard JWST has opened a unique window to observe these emission lines in galaxies at Cosmic Noon. We present the first detection of hot molecular gas in cid_346, an X-ray AGN at $z\sim2.2$, via the H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transition at 2.12 $\mu$m. We measure a hot molecular gas mass of $\sim 8.0 \times 10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is $\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ times lower than the cold molecular gas mass. cid_346 is located in an environment with extended gas structures and satellite galaxies. This is supported by detection of hot and cold molecular gas out to distances $&gt;$10 kpc in MIRI/MRS and ALMA data, respectively and ancillary NIRCam imaging that reveals two satellite galaxies at distances of $\sim$0.4 arcsec (3.3 kpc) and $\sim$0.9 arcsec (7.4 kpc) from the AGN. Our results tentatively indicate that while the CO(3-2)-based cold gas phase dominates the molecular gas mass at Cosmic Noon, H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transitions are effective in tracing hot molecular gas locally in regions that may lack CO emission.</description>

      <title>BASS LII: Clues from Twin Peaks -- Investigating the structure of the AGN broad-line region at low accretion rates with double-peaked emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines attributed to emission from rotating gas in the accretion disk. Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN selected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we systematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters amongst 343 broad-line AGN with redshifts $0.004&lt;z&lt;0.297$ and 2-10 KeV X-ray luminosities of log 40-45.7 (erg/s), and provide their best-fit accretion disk geometry parameters. We find that ~21% of X-ray selected broad-line AGN are double-peaked emitters (DPEs), consistent with rates previously reported for $z&lt;0.2$ broad-line AGN selected for strong optical variability in ZTF. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher masses by ~0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ~0.3 dex than other broad-line AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray luminosities, and higher [OI] $\lambda$6302 to narrow H$\alpha$ flux ratios than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from other broad-line AGN in the $L_{\rm bol}$ vs $M_{\rm BH}$ relation or their X-ray to radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of multi-wavelength properties when comparing DPEs to other broad-line AGN, including optical and mid-IR variability levels, and the rate of changing-look events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multi-component disk-wind models of the AGN broad line region and consider how unrecognized contributions of disk emission to the broad lines introduce biases in virial SMBH mass estimates.</description>

      <title>Escape fractions from unattenuated Ly$\alpha$ emitters around luminous $z&gt;6$ quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionized proximity zones around luminous quasars provide a unique laboratory to characterize the Ly$\alpha$ emission lines from $z&gt;6$ galaxies without significant attenuation from the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, Ly$\alpha$ line measurements for galaxies within high-redshift quasars' proximity zones have been rare so far. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations obtained with the NIRSpec/MSA instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in two $z&gt;6$ quasar fields. We measure the Ly$\alpha$ line fluxes for 50 galaxies at $6&lt;z&lt;7$ with UV absolute magnitude $M_\text{UV}&lt;-19$ (median $M_\text{UV}=-19.97$), among which 15 are located near the luminous quasars, i.e. within $\Delta v&lt;2500\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$. We find that galaxies near the quasars show significant flux bluewards of the systemic Ly$\alpha$ wavelength, and have higher Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width compared to galaxies at similar redshifts that are not located within the quasars' environment. Our result indicates little or no redshift evolution for the Ly$\alpha$-emitter fraction from $z\sim6.4$ to $z\sim5$. Leveraging the low IGM opacity in the quasars' vicinity, we evaluate the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}$) of high-redshift galaxies. Our analysis suggests that galaxies at $\langle z\rangle\approx6.4$ have an average $f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}=0.14\pm0.04$. This value is consistent with reionization models where the Lyman continuum escape fraction is low $(f_\text{esc}^\text{LyC}\lesssim0.1)$ for luminous galaxies, and where the most luminous galaxies have only a minor contribution to the total ionizing photon budget.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Czernik 41 and NGC 1342 Using CCD UBV and Gaia DR3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and Galactic orbital parameters of the open clusters Czernik 41 and NGC 1342, as well as their dynamical evolution, are investigated using CCD UBV photometry and Gaia data. By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, we have determined that 382 stars in Czernik 41 and 111 stars in NGC 1342 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. Fundamental parameters (including reddening, metallicity, distance, and age) were derived using both classical methods, where parameters are determined separately, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, where parameters are estimated simultaneously. The results obtained from both approaches are in agreement, confirming the reliability of the derived parameters and demonstrating their robustness against potential degeneracies. The distances to Czernik 41 and NGC 1342 were determined as 2485$\pm$151 pc and 645$\pm$42 pc, respectively, while their ages were estimated to be 69$\pm$10 Myr and 1000$\pm$50 Myr. The metallicity values ([Fe/H]) were found to be 0.07$\pm$0.09 dex for Czernik 41 and -0.14$\pm$0.07 dex for NGC 1342. The stellar mass functions for both clusters were derived, yielding slopes of $\Gamma$=1.67$\pm$0.23 for Czernik 41 and $\Gamma$ =1.56$\pm$0.41 for NGC 1342. Kinematic orbit analysis indicates that Czernik 41 originated within the Solar circle, whereas NGC 1342 formed outside it.</description>

      <title>The Potential Impact of Primordial Black Holes on Exoplanet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbits of planetary systems can be deformed from their initial configurations due to close encounters with larger astrophysical bodies. Typical candidates for close encounters are stars and binaries. We explore the prospect that if there is a sizeable population of primordial black holes (PBH) in our galaxy, then these may also impact the orbits of exoplanets. Specifically, in a simplified setting, we study numerically how many planetary systems might have a close encounter with a PBH, and analyze the potential changes to the orbital parameters of systems that undergo PBH flybys.</description>

      <title>The PARADIGM project II: The lifetimes and quenching of satellites in Milky Way-mass haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance and star-formation histories of satellites of Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies are linked to their hosts' assembly histories. To explore this connection, we use the PARADIGM suite of zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations of MW-mass haloes, evolving the same initial conditions spanning various halo assembly histories with the VINTERGATAN and IllustrisTNG models. Our VINTERGATAN simulations overpredict the number of satellites compared to observations (and to IllustrisTNG) due to a higher $M_{*}$ at fixed $M_{\rm halo}$. Despite this difference, the two models show good qualitative agreement for both satellite disruption fractions and timescales, and quenching. The number of satellites rises rapidly until $z=1$ and then remains nearly constant. The fraction of satellites from each epoch that are disrupted by $z=0$ decreases steadily from nearly 100% to 0% during $4&gt;z&gt;0.1$. These fractions are higher for VINTERGATAN than IllustrisTNG, except for massive satellites ($M_{*}&gt;10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$) at $z&gt;0.5$. This difference is largely due to varying distributions of pericentric distance, orbital period and number of orbits, in turn determined by which sub(haloes) are populated with galaxies by the two models. The time between accretion and disruption also remains approximately constant over $2&gt;z&gt;0.3$ at $6-8$ Gyr. For surviving satellites at $z=0$, both models recover the observed trend of massive satellites quenching more recently ($&lt;8$ Gyr ago) and within $1.5\,r_{\rm 200c}$ of the host, while low mass satellites quench earlier and often outside the host. Our results provide constraints on satellite accretion, quenching and disruption timescales, while highlighting the convergent trends from two very different galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>The intra-cluster light as estimator of the cluster's mass profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The intra-cluster light (ICL) comprises stars that are unbound to individual galaxies within a galaxy cluster and provides insights into the cluster's mass distribution, evolutionary history and dynamical state. Aims. We aim to study the viability of the intra-cluster stellar mass as a proxy to compute the total mass profiles of galaxy clusters. Methods. High-resolution simulations from the C-EAGLE project are used to study the ratio between intra-cluster stellar mass and total matter projected densities. This ratio follows a power-law, and a model is presented for its fit parameters and associated errors. Results. The aforementioned relation is used to estimate the mass profile of the Perseus cluster using Euclid observations that extend up to 1/3 of the virial radius. The obtained cluster mass is compatible with other measurements from galaxy velocity dispersion, though it is overestimated by a factor 2 compared to X-ray mass estimates. We repeat this process for four clusters in the Hubble Frontier Fields, finding compatibility with weak and strong lensing mass estimates. Conclusions. This methodology provides an independent approach to cluster mass estimation based solely on observed ICL and a simulation-calibrated relation.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of HII regions at sub-kpc scales using integral field spectroscopy on IC 342</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we use Integral Field Spectroscopic (IFS) observations for one of the closest galaxy to us, the grand design spiral IC 342, to derive physical properties of HII regions at sub-kpc scales. This IFS data represents, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive observational effort in the optical for this galaxy. The final IFS datacube consists of 349 individual pointings using the IFS instrumentation from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. Using a prototype of the data analysis pipeline that will be devoted to the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) survey, we measure different observables from the emission line in the optical. In particular, using the flux map of the H$\alpha$ emission line, we derive the location and sizes of H ii region candidates for IC 342. Using the integrated flux for different emission lines within each region, we derived the radial distribution of different physical properties from the ionized gas (e.g., optical extinction, H$\alpha$ luminosity, oxygen abundance, etc). Comparing with larger samples of galaxies with IFS data, our results suggest that physical properties of the ionized gas of IC 342 are similar to galaxies with similar stellar mass in the nearby universe.</description>

      <title>Is Earendel a Star Cluster?: Metal Poor Globular Cluster Progenitors at $z\sim6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongly-lensed $z\sim 6$ Sunrise galaxy offers an incredible opportunity to investigate star formation in the early universe on parsec or smaller scales. The highly magnified object Earendel within the Sunrise was previously identified as a candidate star or binary due to size constraints placed by the lensing magnification, however recent works have suggested this constraint may be relaxed to even the size of star clusters. Here, we explore the hypothesis that Earendel may actually be a star cluster, and simultaneously evaluate other star clusters within the host galaxy. Leveraging deep, archival James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy, we determine a spectroscopic redshift for the Sunrise galaxy $z=5.926 \pm 0.013$, and we fit simple stellar population (SSP) models from three premier libraries to evaluate the physical parameters of Earendel and another distinct star cluster in the Sunrise dubbed `$1b$'. We find the rest-UV through optical continuum of Earendel to be well-described by an SSP, nearly equivalently to $1b$ which is confidently a star cluster. We infer they have intermediate ages $t_{\rm age}\sim 30$--$150\,$Myr, are metal poor ($Z_\star\lesssim10\%\,Z_\odot$), and are consistent with the formation age-metallicity trend seen in local globular clusters. Such intermediate age clusters are seldom probed spectroscopically in the high redshift universe, and we explore the extent to which these clusters can be characterized via the spectroscopic continuum.</description>

      <title>Constructing a Pristine View of Extended Globular Cluster Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular Clusters (GCs) displaying extended structures are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the Milky Way (MW). Despite their low surface brightness, which makes disentangling the true structure from the MW overwhelmingly difficult, the increasing availability of multi-dimensional data sets has allowed for new detections of extended GC structure. This work utilises the Pristine-Gaia-Synthetic catalogue released as part of the Pristine Surveys first data release to search for tidally stripped stars in the peripheries of MW GCs. Pristine provides photometric [Fe/H] measurements based on CaHK-band photometry. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, we provided lists of extra-tidal stars for 30 GCs, one of the largest surveys of its kind. We find that (1) 22 GCs that passed our quality cut have extended structure within 5 deg from the cluster centers of which six are new tentative detections, (2) four of those GCs exhibit diffuse envelope-like extra-tidal features, while the remaining GCs exhibit tidal tail-like structures. We measure the position angles of the extended structures, find broad consistency between the position angles and the GC orbits, and discuss our results concerning N-body models. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of adding photometric metallicities to the multi-dimensional search of extended tidal structure and how the upcoming multi-object spectrographs will be crucial for exploring GC peripheries in the coming years.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Look at PUDG-R21: Stellar Population and Kinematics of a Globular Cluster-Rich Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy in the Perseus Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of the globular cluster (GC) rich ultra-diffuse galaxy, PUDG-R21, using spectroscopic observations obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The recessional velocity is measured to be 5536$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$, confirming its association with the Perseus cluster. The galaxy exhibits mild rotation of 15.6$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ and a stellar velocity dispersion of 19.4$\pm$3.5 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ within the galaxy effective radius. From this, we infer a dynamical mass of M$_{\mathrm{dyn}}=9.3\pm3.3\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$. Based on a halo mass derived from PUDG-R21 GC counts, we find our dynamical mass is consistent with a cored dark matter profile. The integrated stellar population analysis reveals a predominantly old stellar population of 10.4$\pm$1.2 Gyr, with intermediate-low metallicity ([M/H]=-0.64$\pm$0.12 dex) and elevated alpha abundances ([Mg/Fe]=0.38$\pm$0.25 dex). The inferred star formation history suggests rapid stellar assembly, likely truncating prior to or during the galaxy's infall into the cluster at an early epoch ($\sim$10 Gyr ago). The analysis of stellar population gradients (age and metallicity) indicates a flat profile out to one effective radius. Here, we consider the involvement of two star formation events, initially forming a large population of metal-poor globular clusters, and then the latter contributing to the more metal-enriched diffuse stellar body. The evidence of subsequent star formation suggests this galaxy is more like an extension of the classical dwarf population than the much discussed failed galaxy UDGs.</description>

      <title>N-body simulations of galaxy bars generated by satellite collisions: effects of the impact geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars, a common and important structure in disk galaxies, can be induced by galaxy interactions. Although there have been some studies on bar formation in flybys or collisions, the vast parameter space still leaves many scenarios that require further investigation. Here, we focus on the role of collisions caused by small galaxies (denoted as intruders), referred to as satellite collisions, in bar formation for MW/M31-like galaxies (denoted as target galaxies). Multiple sets of simulations with varying intruder initial velocities, inclination angles, collision positions, and intruder masses were run to study the dependence of this mechanism on these parameters. Our simulations show that bar formation favors moderate collision velocity, large inclination angle, off-center collision position, and large intruder mass. However, the bar's pattern speed and length are insensitive to these parameters, as the intruder's mass is relatively small compared to that of the target galaxy itself. Moreover, based on our tests, the intruder mass should be more than $\sim 3\times10^{9}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ in order for this bar formation mechanism to operate effectively in MW/M31-like galaxies. Our work suggests the possibility that satellite collisions may have contributed, to some extent, to the bar formation in the Milky Way or M31.</description>

      <title>PRODIGE VI -- Envelope to Disk with NOEMA: VI. The Missing Sulfur Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the amount of sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the ISM remains one of the main problems in astrochemistry. The detection of H$_2$S ices, which are thought to be one of the main sulfur reservoirs, has not been achieved yet, and the only S-bearing species detected in the ices to date is OCS. PRODIGE large survey observations with NOEMA of several Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus Molecular Cloud provide a perfect opportunity to study the H$_2$S and OCS composition of the ices through the volatiles sublimated in the warm inner core (T$&gt;$100K, n $\sim10^6$cm$^{-3}$) of these protostars. Our aim is to determine the H$_2$S/OCS ratio in the warm inner core of 24 protostars in order to study how it is affected by different factors during its evolution. We used the NOEMA millimeter observations from the PRODIGE program of H$_2$S, H$_2^{33}$S, OCS, OC$^{33}$S and OC$^{34}$S to estimate the H$_2$S and OCS column densities in the warm inner cores. We used SO and SO$_2$ data from the ALMA archive to give a rough estimate of the total sulfur abundance. We explore the chemistry of H$_2$S and OCS in the warm cores using chemical and dynamical simulations of the collapse of a dense core to form a protostar. The estimated H$_2$S/OCS ratio reveals a segregation of the sources into ``OCS-poor'' and ``OCS-rich'' protostars, where the OCS-poor protostars present higher H$_2$S/OCS ratios than the OCS-rich ones. Total sulfur abundance is always dominated by either H$_2$S or OCS, grows with evolution during the Class 0 phase up to $D_S&lt;8$, and decreases again in the Class I. Simulations show that temperature changes in the pre-stellar phase and during the collapse can produce substantial differences in the H$_2$S and OCS abundances and in the H$_2$S/OCS ratio. Our analysis shows that the H$_2$S/OCS ratio is strongly influenced by the environment and the initial conditions of the cloud.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XV. Tracing AIB characteristics in PDR spectra with PAHFIT in the JWST era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photodissociation regions (PDRs) exhibit emission between 3-20 um known as the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), originating from small carbonaceous species such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The AIB spectra observed in Galactic PDRs, such as the Orion Bar observations by the PDRs4All JWST program, are considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic star-forming regions. We present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition tool that separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents, thermal dust emission, gas lines, stellar light, and dust extinction. By fitting segments of the Orion Bar spectra, we provide a configuration to decompose JWST spectra of PDRs in detail. The resulting central wavelengths and FWHM of the AIB subcomponents are compiled into a "PDR pack" for PAHFIT.
  We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the default continuum model to spectra of the central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. We introduce an alternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar spectra, as the default PAHFIT continuum model mismatches the intensity at 15-26 um. PAHFIT fits with the PDR pack and the alternate continuum model reproduce the Orion Bar spectra with residuals of a few percent, and similar performance is achieved for the NGC7469 spectra.
  We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile variations of the 3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 um AIBs, and thus the photochemical evolution of the AIB carriers. The 5.7 um AIB emission originates from at least two subpopulations, one more prominent in highly irradiated environments and one preferring more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small grains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded environments of the molecular zone in the Orion Bar. Based on these new diagnostics, we quantify the similarities between the AIB profiles observed in the Orion Bar and NGC7469.</description>

      <title>Development of Bayesian methods for the characterization of galaxy star formation histories through stellar population synthesis models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project establishes parameters to characterize galaxy Star Formation History (SFH) beyond mean stellar age. We use ages at which fixed star fractions form to characterize SFH duration. We define Deltaage_n = (age_10 - age_90)/age_50 for SFH extension, where age_10, age_90, age_50 correspond to ages when 10%, 90%, and 50% of stars formed. Probability distributions for observed galaxies use robust Bayesian statistics comparing observed and model spectral features. We create composite stellar population (CSP) libraries using SEDlibrary software, implementing varied SFH, metallicity, and dust properties. We compare spectra using ten features: five spectral indices (D4000n, [Hdelta+Hgamma], Hbeta, [Mg_2Fe], [MgFe]') and five SDSS ugriz photometric fluxes. First, we focus on limiting Deltaage_n distinguishing extended from negligible SFH duration, Deltaage_n,min (time resolution). Using idealized CSP library of 5 million dust-free, burst-free models with fixed metallicities from subsolar to supersolar, Deltaage_n,min marks where spectral features depend on SFH duration. We find roughly flat log(Deltaage_n,min) around -0.3 dex over 4 magnitude orders in age. Deltaage_n,min decreases with higher SNR up to SNR=100, beyond which no improvement occurs. Second, we create mock datasets by perturbing 12,500 library models with realistic errors, testing retrieval capability for characteristic ages and SFH duration using realistic 500,000-model CSP library with up to 6 starbursts, dust, and variable metallicity. We constrain SFH duration log(Deltaage_n) within +-0.3 dex for most samples. For populations with strong Balmer absorption and mean age &lt;10^9 yr, uncertainty exceeds 0.5 dex due to SFH degeneracies. These parameters will apply to current and upcoming deep spectroscopic galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Counting mass with Gaia: Mass Density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the light of new full-sky surveys, many attempts of creating a consistent Galactic model were made. The main interest is to estimate the still poorly understood dark matter content. However, the results vary depending on methodology, assumptions, and baryonic distribution used. To understand this discrepancy, we take the first step by estimating the model-free local mass density of stars and stellar remnants. We use a complete sample from the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars within 100 pc from the Sun, together with the data on the sample of the White Dwarfs and the recent estimate of the Neutron Stars concentration in the solar neighborhood. After correction for unresolved binary stars and accounting for missing low-mass stars, we find the local mass density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood is $\rho_{100} = 0.040^{+0.012} _{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Kroupa IMF, and $\rho_{100} = 0.037^{+0.012}_{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Chabrier IMF.</description>

      <title>Photodesorption of SO2 and SO from UV-irradiated SO2 ices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of high gas-phase abundances of SO2 and SO in the cold envelope of an intermediate mass protostar suggests that these molecules might form on icy dust grains and subsequently desorb to the gas phase by non-thermal desorption processes such as photodesorption. In this work we report photodesorption yields for SO2 and, tentatively, SO upon ultraviolet photon irradiation of SO2 ice samples at temperatures between 14 and 80 K. Photodesorption yields were measured directly in the gas phase using a calibrated quadrupole mass spectrometer. Yields of 2.3 x 10-4 molecule/photon and 6 x 10-5 molecule/photon were estimated for SO2 and SO at 14 K (respectively). The SO2 photodesorption yield increased with temperature up to a value of 3.8 x 10-4 molecule/photon at 70 K, followed by a decrease at 80 K that could be due to crystallization of the sample. The signal assigned to SO photodesorption did not significantly change with temperature. The estimated photodesorption yields were included in the Nautilus gas-grain chemical model to evaluate their contribution to the SO2 and SO gas-phase abundances in an astrophysical environment. In addition, we also present a theoretically estimated band strength for the 1395 cm-1 SO3 IR feature (A = 1.1 x 10-16 cm molecule-1). SO3 is the main detected product in irradiated SO2 ices, and a potential contributor to the 7.2 um band observed in some interstellar ice IR spectra.</description>

      <title>Polarization-shape alignment of IllustrisTNG star-forming galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In star-forming disk galaxies, the radio continuum emission (1-10 GHz) powered by star formation has an integral polarization direction imperfectly aligned with the apparent disk minor axis. This polarization-shape alignment effect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is prevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements of cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio continuum surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array synergized with galaxy shape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for star-forming galaxies in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation at 0 &lt; z &lt; 2, assuming that additional polarized radio emission from an active galactic nucleus is negligible in at least a sizable fraction of the star-forming galaxies. The alignment found for z = 0 is consistent with local spiral data, but significantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward lower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic redshifting, observing higher-z galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates degradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame frequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle distribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring a polarization rotation angle induced by cosmic birefringence. For observation at 4.8 GHz, the effective root-mean-square misalignment angle is 18{\deg}, 23{\deg}, and 33{\deg} at z = 0, 1 and 2, respectively. As accurate observation-driven models are not yet available for cosmological galaxy samples, our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize polarization-shape alignment, and can facilitate forecasts of cosmology and fundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.</description>

      <title>The HI-to-H2 transition in the Draco cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, significant attention has been dedicated to analytical and observational studies of the atomic hydrogen (HI) to molecular hydrogen (H2) transition in the interstellar medium. We focussed on the Draco diffuse cloud to gain deeper insights into the physical properties of the transition from HI to H2. We employed the total hydrogen column density probability distribution function (N-PDF) derived from Herschel dust observations and the N(HI)-PDF obtained from HI data collected by the Effelsberg HI survey. The N-PDF of the Draco cloud exhibits a double-log-normal distribution, whereas the N(HI)-PDF follows a single log-normal distribution. The HI-to-H2 transition is identified as the point where the two log-normal components of the dust N-PDF contribute equally; it occurs at Av = 0.33 (N=6.2e20 cm^-2). The low-column-density segment of the dust N-PDF corresponds to the cold neutral medium, which is characterized by a temperature of around 100 K. The higher-column-density part is predominantly associated with H2. The shape of the Draco N-PDF is qualitatively reproduced by numerical simulations. In the absence of substantial stellar feedback, such as radiation or stellar winds, turbulence exerts a significant influence on the thermal stability of the gas and can regulate the condensation of gas into denser regions and its subsequent evaporation. Recent observations of the ionized carbon line at 158 micron in Draco support this scenario. Using the KOSMA-tau photodissociation model, we estimate a gas density of n=50 cm^-3 and a temperature of 100 K at the location of the HI-to-H2 transition. Both the molecular and atomic gas components are characterized by supersonic turbulence and strong mixing, suggesting that simplified steady-state chemical models are not applicable under these conditions.</description>

      <title>From a Different Star: 3I/ATLAS in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford interstellar object population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the third interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS (`3I'), provides a rare chance to directly observe a small body from another Solar System. Studying its chemistry and dynamics will add to our understanding of how the processes of planetesimal formation and evolution happen across the Milky Way's disk, and how such objects respond to the Milky Way's potential. In this Letter, we present a first assessment of 3I in the context of the \={O}tautahi-Oxford model, which uses data from Gaia in conjunction with models of protoplanetary disk chemistry and Galactic dynamics to predict the properties of the ISO population. The model shows that both the velocity and radiant of 3I are within the expected range. Its velocity suggests an origin within the Milky Way's thick disk, making it the first ISO from this population, and predicts a high water mass fraction, which may become observable shortly. We also conclude that it is very unlikely that 3I shares an origin with either of the previous two interstellar object detections.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the dark Universe with HI and EMBER-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation radio telescopes will provide unprecedented data volumes of the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution across cosmic time. Combining weak lensing surveys with spatial and kinematic observations of HI could help constrain key properties of dark matter, such as its mass, clustering behavior, and spatial distribution. However, inferring dark matter properties from HI observations is challenging because of processes related to galaxy formation, such as stellar feedback. Methods that use empirical relations, often calibrated via numerical simulations, do not use full field-level information to model the complex relation between dark matter and HI. We address this shortcoming with a data-driven approach, leveraging the recently introduced EMBER-2 model to learn the HI-dark matter mapping at the field level for a wide redshift range, z=6-0. After training on cosmological galaxy formation simulations run with FIRE-2, EMBER-2 accurately recovers key statistics, including dark matter mass fractions and surface density profiles. The HI-dark matter density cross-correlation is reconstructed at an accuracy of 10% down to scales of k = 100 h/cMpc, a significant improvement over traditional approaches. The presented method may become a key ingredient in future inference pipelines as it can be readily integrated into downstream analysis tasks of radio surveys.</description>

      <title>A new Bowen Fluorescence Flare and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter discovered by SRG/eROSITA</title>

Abstract: The nuclear transient eRASSt J012026.5-292727 (J012026 hereafter) was discovered in the second SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS2). The source appeared more than one order of magnitude brighter than the eRASS1 upper limits (peak eRASS2 0.2-2.3 keV flux of 1.14 x 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1), and with a soft X-ray spectrum (photon index Gamma = 4.3). Over the following months, the X-ray flux started decaying, with significant flaring activity on both hour- and year-timescales. By inspecting the multiwavelength light curves of time-domain wide-field facilities, we detected a strong mid-infrared flare, evolving over 2 years, and a weaker optical counterpart. Follow-up optical spectroscopy revealed transient features, including redshifted Balmer lines (FWHM ~1500 km/s), strong Fe II emission, He II and Bowen lines, and high-ionization iron coronal lines. One spectrum showed a triple-peaked H-beta line, consistent with emission from a face-on elliptical disk. The spectroscopic features and the slow evolution of the event place J012026 within the classifications of Bowen fluorescence flares (BFFs) and extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs). BFFs have been associated with rejuvenated accreting SMBHs, although the mechanism triggering the onset of the new accretion flow is still unclear, while ECLEs have been linked to the disruption of stars in gas-rich environments. The association of J012026 to both classes, combined with the multi-wavelength information, suggests that BFFs could be, at least in some cases, due to tidal disruption events (TDEs). The observed X-ray variability, uncommon in standard TDEs, adds complexity to these families of nuclear transients. These results highlight the diverse phenomenology of nuclear accretion events and demonstrate the value of systematic X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA and Einstein Probe, for uncovering such transients and characterizing their physical origin.</description>

      <title>Nickel- and iron-rich clumps in planetary nebulae: New discoveries and emission-line diagnostics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) offers a distinct advantage for studying extended sources by enabling spatially resolved emission maps for several emission lines without the need for specific filters. This study conducts a detailed analysis of iron and nickel emission lines in 12 planetary nebulae (PNe) using integral field unit (IFU) data from MUSE to provide insights into their formation and evolution mechanisms. New diagnostic line ratios, combined with machine-learning algorithms, were used to distinguish excitation mechanisms such as shock and photoionization. Electron densities and elemental abundances were estimated using different atomic data through the PyNeb package. The contribution of fluorescent excitation of nickel lines was also examined. A total of 16 iron- and nickel-rich clumps are detected in seven out of 12 PNe. New clumps are discovered in NGC 3132 and IC 4406. The most prominent lines are [Fe II] 8617 Angstrom and [Ni II] 7378 Angstrom. Both emission lines are observed emanating directly from the low-ionization structures (LIS) of NGC 3242, NGC 7009, and NGC 6153, as well as from clumps in NGC 6369 and Tc 1. Their abundances are found to be below solar values, indicating that a fraction of Fe and Ni remains depleted in dust grains. The depletion factors exhibit a strong correlation over a wide range. A machine-learning approach allows us to classify ten out of 16 clumps as shock-excited and to establish a new shock/photoionization selection criterion: log([Ni II] 7378 Angstrom / H-alpha) and log([Fe II] 8617 Angstrom / H-alpha) greater than -2.20.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Architectures of Lithium-Rich Giants in GALAH with COSMIC and Stellar Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface lithium is depleted when a star goes through the first dredge-up phase, yet $1\%$ of red giants are found to be Li-rich. The formation mechanism for these remains uncertain. We combine observational constraints from GALAH Li-rich giants, with the binary population synthesis code COSMIC to investigate system properties of these objects assuming binary mass transfer. By evolving 9 million binary systems, we find that binary histories most consistent with observational constraints are mass transfer from an intermediate-mass AGB donor to a main-sequence star now observed as a Li-rich red giant. In GALAH, $9\%$ of main-sequence stars have $\rm A(Li)=2.5-3.2$ dex making it plausible to create red giants with $\rm A(Li)=1.5-2.2 \; dex$ via main-sequence mass transfer, but cannot explain the more enriched giants $\rm A(Li) \gtrsim 2.2 \; dex$. Nucleosynthetic yields from stellar models show that AGB stars with initial masses of $4.25-5 \; \rm M_\odot$ and $8 \; \rm M_\odot$ contain the most Li in their ejecta. Intermediate-mass AGB stars comprise $29\%$ of COSMIC results, with present-day separations $s=3.3\pm0.5 \rm \; AU$ and mass ratios $q=0.5-1.6$. We achieve $95\%$ agreement in mean enhancements in $\rm (Ba, Y)$ between GALAH observations and stellar models of 6 and $8 \rm \; M_\odot$ AGB, assuming $1\%$ mass transfer efficiency. We find a low mass transfer efficiency best reproduces GALAH observations suggesting that the preferred mass transfer mechanism for Li-enrichment is via wind Roche Lobe Overflow. While we constrain the most plausible binary parameters assuming AGB mass transfer creates Li-rich giants, discrepancies in nucleosynthesis comparisons, and the small fraction of Li-enhanced main-sequence stars suggests additional enrichment mechanisms are likely.</description>

      <title>An optical to infrared study of type II SN2024ggi at nebular times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS" [arXiv:2507.02757]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows a weak cometary activity. Its brightness suggests a maximum radius of ~10km (A/0.05)^{-1/2} for an asteroid with an albedo A. I show that interstellar objects with that radius would amount to an interstellar mass density that is well above the expected mass budget of interstellar comets or asteroids. Given this budget, the detection rate of objects like 3I/ATLAS implies that it is a comet with a small core radius &lt;0.6km, or a member of a rare population with a number density &lt;5x10^{-8}au^{-3}} for R&lt;10km. The second possibility would suggest that the rare population of 3I/ATLAS objects favors plunging orbits towards the inner solar system to accommodate their inferred detection rate.</description>

      <title>Magnetic White Dwarfs in the SDSS 100 pc Sample: Further Evidence of Two Formation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a model atmosphere analysis on all magnetic white dwarfs in the SDSS 100 pc sample. We have 163 magnetic targets in this sample, 87 of which are new discoveries, making this the largest volume-limited survey of magnetic white dwarfs to date. We discuss the distribution of multiple parameters, including mass, cooling age, and field strength. We find strong evidence of two populations of magnetic white dwarfs that form through separate mechanisms based on a cluster analysis of these parameters. The young, high mass objects typically have high field strengths which indicate a merger origin, while old, average mass objects have weaker fields that likely originated through a crystallization-induced dynamo or previous evolution stages. When comparing young and old objects, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests yield statistically significant differences between the field strengths and masses of the magnetic targets. We use a Gaussian mixture model to identify where these populations lie in parameter space, and we find two groups centered at distinct cooling ages, masses, and field strengths: 2.9 Gyr, 0.71 $M_{\odot}$, 3.7 MG and 1.8 Gyr, 0.96 $M_{\odot}$, 84 MG respectively. Our results further support the dual formation channel previously reported in the literature. The occurrence of magnetism strongly correlates with the onset of crystallization. However, given the breakout times required for a crystallization dynamo, we find that many of our older, average mass objects can be better explained with a core-convective dynamo that forms on the main-sequence.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing PTA measurements via early seeding of supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing evidence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) being present in the early Universe poses challenges to their traditional formation pathways. Separately, studies suggest that merging SMBH binaries with total masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ could be the primary sources of the nanohertz gravitational wave background detected by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Owing to their extreme masses, these SMBHs have a higher probability of forming earlier than their lower-mass counterparts. In this work, we provide a formalism to calculate the implications of early seeded SMBHs for the PTA signal. As an application, we explore the two most prominent scenarios of high-$z$ SMBHs seeding mechanisms: direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) and collapse of supermassive dark stars (SMDSs). We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs, with comoving seed number density of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ can be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $&gt; 10^9 M_\odot$ binaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z&lt; 1$. By contrast, SMBHs seeded via the DCBH channel may contribute only sub-dominantly unless produced with a much larger number density than implied by numerical simulations. Our analysis further suggests that the seed number density should be $&lt; \mathcal{O}(10^{-1}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ in order to not over-predict the expected PTA signal.</description>

Abstract: We present results from the SNAD VIII Workshop, during which we conducted the first systematic anomaly search in the ZTF fields also observed by LSSTComCam during Rubin Scientific Pipeline commissioning. Using the PineForest active anomaly detection algorithm, we analysed four selected fields (two galactic and two extragalactic) and visually inspected 400 candidates. As a result, we discovered six previously uncatalogued variable stars, including RS~CVn, BY Draconis, ellipsoidal, and solar-type variables, and refined classifications and periods for six known objects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNAD anomaly detection pipeline and provide a preview of the discovery potential in the upcoming LSST data.</description>

      <title>Gravity or turbulence? VII. The Schmidt-Kennicutt law, the star formation efficiency, and the mass density of clusters from gravitational collapse rather than turbulent support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relations and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time ($\epsilon_{\rm ff}$), mirroring observational studies, in numerical simulations of filamentary molecular clouds undergoing gravitational contraction. We find that (a)~collapsing clouds accurately replicate the observed SK relations for galactic clouds and (b)~$\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ is small and constant in space and in time, with values similar to those found in local clouds. We propose that this constancy arises from the similar radial scaling of the free-fall time ($\tau_{\rm ff}$) and the internal mass in density structures with spherically-averaged density profiles near $r^{-2}$. We additionally show that (c)~the star formation rate (SFR) increases rapidly in time; (d)~the low values of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ result from evaluating $\tau_{\rm ff}$ and the characteristic star-formation time scale over different time intervals, combined with the increasing SFR, and (e)~the fact that star clusters are significantly denser than the gas clumps from which they form is a natural consequence of the rapidly increasing SFR, the continuous replenishment of the star-forming gas by the accretion flow, and the near $r^{-2}$ density profile induced by the collapse. Finally, we argue that interpreting $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ as an efficiency is problematic since it is not bounded by unity, and because the gas mass in clouds evolves. Instead, we propose that viewing $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ as the ratio of the actual SFR to the gas free-fall rate. In summary, our results show that the SK relation, the low values of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, and the mass density of stellar clusters arise naturally from gravitational contraction.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise Ratio Analytic Formulae of the Inspiral Binary Black Holes in TianQin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary black holes are one of the important sources for the TianQin gravitational wave project. Our research has revealed that, for TianQin, the signal-to-noise ratio of inspiral binary black holes can be computed analytically. This finding is expected to greatly simplify the estimation of detection capabilities for binary black holes. In this paper, we demonstrated the signal-to-noise ratio relationships from stellar-mass black holes to massive black holes. With the all-sky average condition, the signal-to-noise ratio for most binary black hole signals can be determined with a relative error of $\lesssim10\%$, with notable deviations only for chirp masses near $1000~M_\odot$. In contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio without the average includes an additional term, which we refer to as the response factor. Although this term is not easily calculated analytically, we provide a straightforward estimation method with an error margin of $1\sigma$ within 2\%.</description>

      <title>Cold Gas and Star Formation in the Phoenix Cluster with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present integral field unit observations of the Phoenix Cluster with the JWST Mid-infrared Instrument's Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). We focus this study on the molecular gas, dust, and star formation in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use precise spectral modeling to produce maps of the silicate dust, molecular gas, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the inner $\sim$50 kpc of the cluster. We measure the optical depth from silicates by comparing the observed H$_2$ line ratios to those predicted by excitation models. We provide updated measurements of the total molecular gas mass of $1.9^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ which agrees with CO-based estimates, providing an estimate of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.8 \pm 0.2\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}\,({\rm K}\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1})^{-1}$; an updated stellar mass of $M_* = 2.6 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{10}$ $M_\odot$; and star formation rates averaged over 10 and 100 Myr of $\langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 10} = 1340 \pm 100$ $M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, and $\langle{\rm SFR}\rangle_{\rm 100} = 740 \pm 80$ $M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, respectively. The H$_2$ emission seems to be powered predominantly by shocks and star formation within the central $\sim 20$ kpc, induced by stellar feedback and radio jets from the active galactic nucleus. Additionally, we find nearly an order of magnitude drop in the star formation rates estimated by PAH fluxes in cool core BCGs compared to field galaxies, suggesting that hot particles from the intracluster medium are destroying PAH grains even in the centralmost 10s of kpc.</description>

Abstract: The local stellar halo of the Milky Way is known to contain the debris from accreted dwarf galaxies and globular clusters, in the form of stellar streams and over-densities in the space of orbital properties (e.g. integrals of motion). While several over-densities have been uncovered and characterised dynamically using Gaia data, their nature is not always clear. Especially for a complete understanding of the smaller halo substructures, the kinematic information from Gaia needs to be coupled with chemical information. In this work, we combine Gaia data with targeted high-resolution UVES spectroscopy of five small substructures that were recently discovered in the local halo, namely the ED-2, -3, -4, -5 and -6 (the ED streams). We present the chemical abundances measured from our newly obtained UVES spectra (20 stars) and from archival UVES spectra (nine stars). We compare these with homogeneously derived abundances from archive spectra of 12 Gaia Enceladus (GE) stars. The chemical abundances of all five substructures suggest that they are of accreted origin, except for two stars that present a high [{\alpha}/Fe] at high [Fe/H] more in line with an in situ origin. All but ED-2 present a significant spread in [Fe/H] suggestive of a dwarf galaxy origin. ED-3 and ED-4 tend to exhibit lower [{\alpha}/Fe] compared to GE stars. ED-5 and ED-6 are consistent with the GE chemical track and could be high-energy tails of GE that were lost earlier in the accretion process. We present new elemental abundances for 5 ED-2 stars, including more elements for the Gaia BH3 companion star. Our findings are in line with the picture that ED-2 is a disrupted ancient star cluster.</description>

      <title>The Physical Properties and Morphologies of Faint Dusty Star-forming Galaxies Identified with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a sample of 234 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in the A2744 and GOODS-S fields using JWST/NIRCam-selected galaxies as priors for SCUBA-2 measurements. This method provides a large number of galaxies both above an 850$\,\mathrm{\mu}$m flux of 2 mJy (47 bright DSFGs) and below (187 faint DSFGs), representing the largest sample of individually identified (i.e., not stacked) faint DSFGs to date. We observe that the NIRCam F444W and F150W fluxes are tightly correlated with redshift, with fainter sources lying at higher redshifts, suggesting that the observed near-infrared flux may be an effective way of selecting high-redshift DSFGs. We study the physical properties and morphologies of the DSFGs through spectral energy distribution fitting and parametric surface brightness profile modeling. Other than the lower star formation rates (SFRs) and total infrared luminosities in the faint DSFGs (SFR $= 80^{+81}_{-45}$; $L_{\rm IR} = 11.82^{+0.30}_{-0.36}$) compared to the bright DSFGs (SFR $= 254^{+135}_{-131}$; $L_{\rm IR} = 12.32^{+0.20}_{-0.30}$), the populations have similar properties. The stellar masses do not appear to be strongly dependent on either the SFRs or the submillimeter flux. These results suggest that the faint DSFGs are drawn from the same population of galaxies as the bright DSFGs. Based on visual inspections, we find a lower merger fraction ($\sim21$%) relative to previous HST-based studies, suggesting that dust attenuation may have impacted previous estimates of DSFG merger rates.</description>

      <title>JADES and SAPPHIRES: Galaxy Metamorphosis Amidst a Huge, Luminous Emission-line Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a remarkably large and luminous line-emitting nebula extending on either side of the Balmer-break galaxy JADES-GS-518794 at z=5.89, detected with JADES JWST/NIRCam imaging in [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007 and H$\alpha$ and spectroscopically confirmed with NIRCam/WFSS thanks to the pure-parallel SAPPHIRES programme. The end-to-end velocity offset is $\Delta v=830\pm130$ km s$^{-1}$. Nebulae with such large size and high luminosity (25-pkpc diameter, L[O III] = $1.2\times 10^{10}$ L$_\odot$) are routinely observed around bright quasars, unlike JADES-GS-518794. With a stellar mass of $10^{10.1}$ M$_\odot$, this galaxy is at the knee of the mass function at z=6. Its star-formation rate declined for some time (10-100 Myr prior to observation), followed by a recent (10 Myr) upturn. This system is part of a candidate large-scale galaxy overdensity, with an excess of Balmer-break galaxies compared to the field (3 $\sigma$). We discuss the possible origin of this nebula as material from a merger or gas expelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The symmetry of the nebula, its bubble-like morphology, kinematics, high luminosity, and the extremely high equivalent width of [OIII] together favour the AGN interpretation. Intriguingly, there may be a physical connection between the presence of such a large, luminous nebula and the possible metamorphosis of the central galaxy towards quenching.</description>

      <title>Low Surface Brightness structures from annotated deep CFHT images: effects of the host galaxy's properties and environment</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical galactic evolution models predict that mergers drive galaxy growth, producing low surface brightness (LSB) tidal features that trace galaxies' late assembly. These faint structures encode information about past mergers and are sensitive to the properties and environment of the host galaxy. We investigated the relationships between LSB features and their hosts in a sample of 475 nearby massive galaxies spanning diverse environments (field, groups, Virgo cluster) using deep optical imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (MATLAS, UNIONS/CFIS, VESTIGE, NGVS). Using Jafar, an online annotation tool, we manually annotated tidal features and extended stellar haloes, including 199 tidal tails and 100 streams. Geometric and photometric measurements were extracted to analyse their dependence on galaxy mass, environment, and internal kinematics. At our surface brightness limit of 29 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$, tidal features and stellar haloes contribute 2% and 10% of total galaxy luminosity, respectively. Tidal features are detected in 36% of galaxies, with none fainter than 27.8 mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$. The most massive galaxies are twice as likely to host tidal debris, and for early-type galaxies their halos are twice as luminous as those in lower-mass systems, a trend not observed in late-type galaxies. Although small-scale interactions increase the frequency of tidal features, the large-scale environment does not influence it. An anticorrelation between this frequency and rotational support is found, but may reflect the mass-driven effect. We release our database of annotated features for deep learning applications. Our findings confirm that galaxy mass is the dominant factor influencing tidal feature prevalence, consistent with hierarchical formation models.</description>

      <title>Predictions for the Detectability of Milky Way Satellite Galaxies and Outer-Halo Star Clusters with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the sensitivity of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to faint, resolved Milky Way satellite galaxies and outer-halo star clusters. We characterize the expected sensitivity using simulated LSST data from the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Data Challenge 2 (DC2) accessed and analyzed with the Rubin Science Platform as part of the Rubin Early Science Program. We simulate resolved stellar populations of Milky Way satellite galaxies and outer-halo star clusters over a wide range of sizes, luminosities, and heliocentric distances, which are broadly consistent with expectations for the Milky Way satellite system. We inject simulated stars into the DC2 catalog with realistic photometric uncertainties and star/galaxy separation derived from the DC2 data itself. We assess the probability that each simulated system would be detected by LSST using a conventional isochrone matched-filter technique. We find that assuming perfect star/galaxy separation enables the detection of resolved stellar systems with $M_V$ = 0 mag and $r_{1/2}$ = 10 pc with &gt;50% efficiency out to a heliocentric distance of ~250 kpc. Similar detection efficiency is possible with a simple star/galaxy separation criterion based on measured quantities, although the false positive rate is higher due to leakage of background galaxies into the stellar sample. When assuming perfect star/galaxy classification and a model for the galaxy-halo connection fit to current data, we predict that 89 +/- 20 Milky Way satellite galaxies will be detectable with a simple matched-filter algorithm applied to the LSST wide-fast-deep data set. Different assumptions about the performance of star/galaxy classification efficiency can decrease this estimate by ~7%-25%, which emphasizes the importance of high-quality star/galaxy separation for studies of the Milky Way satellite population with LSST.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Outliers: Low-Spin Halos Explain the Abundance, Compactness, and Redshift Evolution of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Little Red Dots (LRDs) are high-redshift galaxies uncovered by JWST, characterized by small effective radii ($R_{\rm eff} \sim 80-300$ pc), number densities that are intermediate between those of typical galaxies and quasars, and a redshift distribution peaked at $z \sim 5$. We present a theoretical model in which the LRDs descend from dark matter halos in the extreme low-spin tail of the angular momentum distribution. Within this framework, we explain their three key observational signatures: (i) abundance, (ii) compactness, and (iii) redshift distribution. Our model focuses on observed, not modeled, properties; it is thus independent of whether they are powered primarily by a black hole or stars. We find that the assumption that the prototypical LRD at $z\sim5$ originates from halos in the lowest $\sim 1\%$ of the spin distribution is sufficient to reproduce both their observed number densities and physical sizes. The redshift evolution of their observability is driven by the interplay between the evolving compact disk fraction and cosmological surface brightness dimming. This effect leads to a well-defined "LRDs Era" at $4&lt;z&lt;8$, during which the LRDs are common and detectable; at $z&lt;4$, they are bright but rare, while at $z&gt;8$, they are common but faint. Finally, we test the predicted redshift trend against observational data, finding excellent agreement. Additional observational support comes from their excess small-scale clustering and spectral signatures of extreme core densities, both of which are expected outcomes of galaxy formation in low-spin halos. These findings suggest that the LRDs are not a fundamentally distinct population but the natural manifestation of galaxies forming in the rarest, lowest angular momentum environments.</description>

      <title>Predicting the resolved CO emission of $z=1-3$ star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Abridged) Resolved observations of the CO emission from $z=1-3$ star-forming galaxies are becoming increasingly common, with new high-resolution surveys on the horizon. We aim to inform the interpretation of this resolved CO emission by creating synthetic observations and testing to what extent routinely observed CO transitions can be used to trace H$_2$ across galaxy disks. To this end, we extract $z=1-3$ massive star-forming galaxies (on and above the main sequence) from the SIMBA cosmological simulation and predict their spatially resolved CO(1$-$0)-to-CO(5$-$4) emission using the $\texttt{SLICK}$ pipeline, which combines sub-resolution modeling of the cloud population with the DESPOTIC spectral line calculation code. We find that the CO(1$-$0)-to-H$_2$ ratio ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$) varies significantly within these galaxy disks$-$from values of $\sim1-5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$ in the central 1-3 kpc of the most massive galaxies to $&gt;100$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$ at $\sim$ 15 kpc. Thus, the use of a single $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ to derive the H$_2$ surface density leads to severe underestimates of the H$_2$ contribution in its outskirts. As expected, higher-$J$ CO transitions trace molecular gas in the centers at higher densities, whereas CO(1$-$0) better traces the more diffuse, extended molecular gas. We see significant variations in the CO excitation, with CO(3$-$2)/CO(1$-$0) line luminosity ratios of the most massive galaxies at $z\sim2$ declining from $\sim$ 0.9 in the galaxy centers to $\sim$ 0.1 in the outskirts. On average, line ratios increase substantially toward higher redshifts and lower galaxy stellar masses. We predict that tracing molecular gas with CO beyond 3-5 kpc of cosmic noon galaxies will be challenging with current facilities due to the drastic increase in $\alpha_{\rm CO}$.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster ESO 280-SC06: A Formerly Massive, Tidally Disrupted Globular Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first high-resolution abundance study of ESO 280-SC06, one of the least luminous and most metal-poor gravitationally bound Milky Way globular clusters. Using Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for ten stars, we confirm the cluster's low metallicity as [Fe/H] = $-2.54 \pm 0.06$ and the presence of a nitrogen-enhanced star enriched by binary mass transfer. We determine abundances or abundance upper limits for 21 additional elements from the light, alpha, odd-Z, iron peak, and neutron-capture groups for all ten stars. We find no spread in neutron-capture elements, unlike previous trends identified in some metal-poor globular clusters such as M15 and M92. Eight of the ten stars have light-element abundance patterns consistent with second-population globular cluster stars, which is a significantly larger second-population fraction than would be expected from the low present-day mass of $10^{4.1}$ Msun. We estimate the initial mass of the cluster as $10^{5.4 - 5.7}$ Msun based on its orbit in the Milky Way. A preferential loss of first-population stars could explain the high fraction of second-population stars at the present time. Our results emphasize the importance of considering mass loss when studying globular clusters and their enrichment patterns.</description>

      <title>Predicting wide binaries and deviations from standard gravity using machine learning algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework for the detection of wide binary star systems and the identification of deviations from standard gravity using Gaia DR3 data. By training supervised ML models on established wide binary catalogues, we efficiently classify wide binaries and employ clustering and nearest neighbour search to pair candidate systems. We recast the problem of identifying systematic deviations from standard gravity as a supervised anomaly detection. Our approach incorporates data preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE, correlation analysis, and PCA, and achieves high accuracy and recall in both binary classification and anomaly detection tasks. The resulting publicly available code enables rapid, scalable, and customizable analysis of wide binaries and gravitational anomalies, complementing conventional analyses and providing a valuable resource for future astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Observed Anti-parallel Correlation Between Spiral Galaxy and Cosmic Filament Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of galactic angular momentum and its connection to the cosmic web remains a pivotal issue in galaxy formation. Using kinematic data from the MaNGA survey, we investigate the alignment between the spin directions of spiral galaxies and their host cosmic filaments. By incorporating filament spin measurements derived from redshift asymmetry across filament spines, we reveal a mass-dependent anti-parallel correlation: low-mass spiral galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot) \lesssim 10$) exhibit a statistically significant anti-parallel alignment between their stellar/gas spins and filament spins, while high-mass spirals show no such trend. Spatial analysis further indicates that high-mass spirals preferentially reside near filament spines, whereas low-mass spirals occupy filament outskirts. These findings extend previous alignment studies that neglected directional spin correlations and provide new insights into how cosmic environments shape galactic angular momentum. The observed anti-parallel trend suggests a critical role for filament spin in regulating the angular momentum acquisition of low-mass spirals. This anti-parallel alignment is significantly enhanced for low-mass spirals residing in dynamically cold filaments, highlighting the importance of filament properties in shaping galaxy spin.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic states in Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter model with axionlike interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase diagrams of ultralight dark matter (DM), modeled as a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate with axionlike interaction, are studied. We classify stable, metastable, and unstable DM states over a wide range of condensate wave function amplitudes. It is shown that the axionlike interaction causes instability and an imaginary speed of sound at low amplitudes, whereas, in a specific high-amplitude band, DM attains a stable state capable of forming a dense solitonic core and suppressing quantum fluctuations in the surrounding galactic DM halo. These findings are corroborated by evaluating thermodynamic functions for DM in the dwarf galaxy NGC2366 and its hypothetical analogs with different core-to-halo mass ratios. Distinct DM phase compositions respond differently to fluctuation-induced partial pressure, resulting in a first-order phase transition in a certain range of an interaction parameter. While the DM properties in NGC2366 lie within the supercritical regime, the phase transition nonetheless provides a thermodynamic marker separating stable from unstable DM configurations. Once a dense core forms - reaching a threshold of about 12% of the total mass - the enhanced gravitation stabilizes the DM halo against fluctuations, while the internal pressure ensures core stability. In particular, we find that NGC2366's dense DM comprises roughly 19% of the DM mass while occupying only 4.7% of its total volume.</description>

Abstract: We present a sample of 53 galaxy spectra at z_spec ~ 5-12 from the JWST CEERS and RUBIES surveys, combining NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy with NIRCam photometry. We aim to use these data to establish best practices for measuring the UV spectral slope ($\beta$) in the era of JWST. We adopt power-law fits to the rest-frame UV continuum from the spectroscopic data as our fiducial, or `true', $\beta$ values, and compare them to photometric estimates derived through four methods: (1) photometric power-law fitting, (2) power-law fitting to an SED model fitted to the photometry, (3) single-color fitting near the Lyman break, and (4) single-color fitting at fixed rest-frame wavelengths. We find that photometric power-law fitting most closely recovers the spectroscopic slopes, with minimal bias and scatter. SED fitting performs moderately well, and can be preferable in cases of low signal-to-noise where photometric power-law fitting may become unreliable. Single-color estimates, while commonly used in past studies, show the most significant deviations and are not recommended when more than a single color is available. Our results highlight the limitations and strengths of each approach and provide practical guidance for measuring $\beta$ from photometry when spectra are unavailable or are of insufficient quality.</description>

      <title>A gravitational acceleration model to explain the double-peaked narrow emission lines shifted in the same direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose, for the first time, an oversimplified but potentially effective gravitational acceleration model to interpret the double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) shifted in the same direction. We adopt the framework of a merging kpc-scale dual-core system in an elliptical orbit, which has an emission-line galaxy with clear narrow line regions (NLRs) merging with a companion galaxy lacking emission line features. Due to gravitational forces induced by both galaxies on the NLRs, the accelerations of the far-side and near-side NLR components may share the same vector direction when projected along the line-of-sight, leading the velocities of the observed DPNELs to shift in the same direction. Our simulations indicate that the probability of producing double-peaked features shifted in the same direction reaches 5.81% in merging kpc-scale dual core systems containing emission-line galaxies. Besides the expected results from our proposed model, we identify a unique galaxy SDSS J001050.52-103246.6, whose apparent DPNELs shifted in the same direction can be plausibly explained by the gravitational acceleration model. This proposed model provides a new path to explain DPNELs shifted in the same direction in the scenario that the two galaxies align along the line-of-sight in kpc-scale dual-core systems.</description>

      <title>A COMPASS to Model Comparison and Simulation-Based Inference in Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present COMPASS, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. COMPASS handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, COMPASS evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</description>

      <title>Predicting the number density of heavy seed massive black holes due to an intense Lyman-Werner field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. $z \gtrsim 4$) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the $\texttt{Renaissance}$ simulation suite. $\texttt{Renaissance}$ is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-$z$ Universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately $\rm{10^{-4} \ cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 10$. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature (e.g. rapid assembly; relative velocities between baryons and dark matter) seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high $z$.</description>

      <title>Brown dwarf number density in the JWST COSMOS-Web field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs are failed stars with very low mass (13 to 75 $M_J$), and an effective temperature lower than 2500 K. Thus, they play a key role in understanding the gap in the mass function between stars and planets. However, due to their faint nature, previous searches are inevitably limited to the solar neighbourhood (20 pc). To improve our knowledge of the low mass part of the initial stellar mass function and the star formation history of the Milky Way, it is crucial to find more distant brown dwarfs. Using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) COSMOS-Web data, this study seeks to enhance our comprehension of the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs situated at a distance of kpc scale. The exceptional sensitivity of the JWST enables the detection of brown dwarfs that are up to 100 times more distant than those discovered in the earlier all-sky infrared surveys. The large area coverage of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey allows us to find more distant brown dwarfs than earlier JWST studies with smaller area coverages. To capture prominent water absorption features around 2.7 $\mu$m, we apply two colour criteria, F115W-F277W+1&lt;F277W-F444W and F277W-F444W&gt;0.9. We then select point sources by CLASS_STAR, FLUX_RADIUS, and SPREAD_MODEL criteria. Faint sources are visually checked to exclude possibly extended sources. We conduct SED fitting and MCMC simulations to determine their physical properties and associated uncertainties. Our search reveals 25 T-dwarf and 2 Y-dwarf candidates, more than any previous JWST brown dwarf searches. They are located from 0.3 kpc to 4 kpc away from the Earth. The cumulative number count of our brown dwarf candidates is consistent with the prediction from a standard double exponential model. Three of our brown dwarf candidates were detected by HST, with transverse velocities $12\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$, $12\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$, and $17\pm6$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Star formation and accretion rates within 500 pc as traced by Gaia DR3 XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion rates from protoplanetary disks onto forming stars are a key ingredient in star formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. Extensive efforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and narrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large populations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to perform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc. We characterise the H$\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\alpha$ pseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion luminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate YSO H$\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select specific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large population of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The population of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star forming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs appear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs. We find $L_{acc}\propto L_\star^{1.41\pm0.02}$ and $\dot M_{acc}\propto M_\star^{2.4\pm0.1}$ for the purest all-sky sample of YSO candidates. By fitting an exponential to the fraction of accreting stars in clusters of different ages in the Sco-Cen complex, we obtain an accretion timescale of 2.7$\pm$0.4 Myr. The percentage of accretors found by fitting a power-law is 70% at 2 Myr and 2.8% at 10 Myr. With this new catalogue of H$\alpha$ emitters we significantly increase the number of YSO candidates with accretion rate estimations in the local neighbourhood. This allows us to study accretion timescales and the spatial and physical properties of YSO accretion from a large, all-sky, and homogeneous sample for the first time. [abridged]</description>

      <title>GalaxyGenius: Mock galaxy image generator for various telescopes from hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations. Its implementation will support and advance research on galaxies in the era of large-scale sky surveys. The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely used radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes, while also incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs), and background noise to generate the required mock observational images of galaxies. To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, we created a series of mock images of galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and ground-based surveys, spanning ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) wavelength coverage, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius offers a flexible framework to generate mock galaxy images with customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research. They can also serve as training sets for relevant studies using deep learning in cases where real observational data are insufficient.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified scheme of blazar evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs, including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score, combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar diversity beyond discrete classes.</description>
