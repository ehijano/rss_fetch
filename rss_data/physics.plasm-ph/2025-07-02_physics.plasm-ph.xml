      <title>Ab initio density functional theory approach to warm dense hydrogen: from density response to electronic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of warm dense hydrogen is of key importance for the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and to understand and further optimize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. The work horse of warm dense matter theory is given by thermal density functional theory (DFT), which, however, suffers from two limitations: (i) its accuracy can depend on the utilized exchange--correlation (XC) functional, which has to be approximated and (ii) it is generally limited to single-electron properties such as the density distribution. Here, we present a new ansatz combining time-dependent DFT results for the dynamic structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ with static DFT results for the density response. This allows us to estimate the electron--electron static structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q})$ of warm dense hydrogen with high accuracy over a broad range of densities and temperatures. In addition to its value for the study of warm dense matter, our work opens up new avenues for the future study of electronic correlations exclusively within the framework of DFT for a host of applications.</description>

      <title>Self-organization of earth's inner magnetospheric multi-ion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-organization of a magnetized multi-ion plasma, composed of inertialess electrons and inertial H+, He+, and O+ ions, leads to the formation of quadruple Beltrami (QB) field structures. The QB self-organized state is a linear combination of four single Beltrami fields, and it is a non-force-free state that shows strong magnetofluid coupling. Moreover, the QB state is characterized by four relaxed state structures of different length scales. The investigation reveals that the generalized helicities of plasma species and the densities of ion species have a significant impact on the characteristics of the self-organized vortices in the QB state. The study also highlights the potential consequences of QB field structures on earth's inner magnetosphere, including diamagnetic and paramagnetic trends as well as heating effects resulting from disparate length scales.</description>

      <title>Impact of temperature asymmetry and small fraction of static positive ions on the relaxed states of a relativistic hot pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxed state of a magnetized relativistic hot plasma composed of inertial electrons and positrons having different relativistic temperatures and a fraction of static positive ions is studied. From the steady-state solutions of vortex dynamics equations and the relation for current density, a non-force-free triple Beltrami (TB) relaxed state equation is derived. The TB state is characterized by three scale parameters that consequently provide three different self-organized structures. The analysis of the relaxed state shows that for specific values of generalized helicities, the disparity in relativistic temperature and the existence of a small fraction of static positive ions in pair plasma can transform the nature of scale parameters. Moreover, an analytical solution of the TB state for an axisymmetric cylindrical geometry with an internal conductor configuration demonstrates that due to asymmetries of temperature and density of plasma species, diamagnetic structures can transform into paramagnetic ones and vice versa. The present study will improve our understanding of pair plasmas in trap-based plasma confinement experiments and astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of a Two Electron-Temperature Relativistic Hot Electron-Positron-Ion Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation of a relativistic hot electron-positron plasma with a small fraction of cold electrons and ion species is investigated, and a quadruple Beltrami (QB) relaxed state is derived. The QB state is a non-force-free state that is a linear combination of four single force-free states and is therefore comprised of four self-organized structures. Additionally, triple as well as double Beltrami states can be obtained by adjusting the generalized helicities of plasma species. The analysis of the relaxed states demonstrates that, for specific values of the generalized helicities, cold species density and relativistic temperature can transform paramagnetic structures into diamagnetic structures and vice versa. Also, when the flow vortices of plasma species are aligned with the magnetic field, it leads to a classically perfect diamagnetic relaxed state, and the strength of the magnetic field increases with a decrease in relativistic temperature and an increase in cold species density. The current investigation aims to enhance comprehension of energy transformation mechanisms and the formation of multiscale structures in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Bounce-Averaged Theory In Arbitrary Multi-Well Plasmas: Solution Domains and the Graph Structure of their Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bounce-averaged theories provide a framework for simulating relatively slow processes, such as collisional transport and quasilinear diffusion, by averaging these processes over the fast periodic motions of a particle on a closed orbit. This procedure dramatically increases the characteristic timescale and reduces the dimensionality of the modeled system. The natural coordinates for such calculations are the constants of motion (COM) of the fast particle motion, which by definition do not change during an orbit. However, for sufficiently complicated fields -- particularly in the presence of local maxima of the electric potential and magnetic field -- the COM are not sufficient to specify the particle trajectory. In such cases, multiple domains in COM space must be used to solve the problem, with boundary conditions enforced between the domains to ensure continuity and particle conservation. Previously, these domains have been imposed by hand, or by recognizing local maxima in the fields, limiting the flexibility of bounce-averaged simulations. Here, we present a general set of conditions for identifying consistent domains and the boundary condition connections between the domains, allowing the application of bounce-averaged theories in arbitrarily complicated and dynamically-evolving electromagnetic field geometries. We also show how the connections between the domains can be represented by a directed graph, which can help to succinctly represent the trajectory bifurcation structure.</description>

      <title>Inverse Velocity Dispersion of Solar Energetic Protons Observed by Solar Orbiter and Its Shock Acceleration Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle acceleration and transport process during solar eruptions is one of the critical and long-standing problems in space plasma physics. Through decades of research, it is well accepted that particles with higher energies released during a solar eruption arrive at observers earlier than the particles with lower energies, forming a well-known structure in the dynamic energy spectrum called particle velocity dispersion (VD), as frequently observed by space missions. However, this picture is challenged by new observations from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA's Solar Orbiter which show an unexpected inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) phenomenon, where particles with higher-energies arrive later at the observer. Facing on the challenge, we here report the recent discovery of such IVD structures with 10 solar energetic proton events observed by Solar Orbiter, and then analyze the mechanisms causing this unusual phenomenon. We suggest that shock diffusive acceleration, with respect to magnetic reconnection, is probably a dominant mechanism to accelerate protons to tens of MeV in such events where particles need longer time to reach higher energies. And we determine, innovatively, the physical conditions and time scales during the actual shock acceleration process that cannot be observed directly.</description>

      <title>2D electron density profile evolution during detachment in Super-X divertor L-mode discharges on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2D electron density profiles obtained from coherence imaging spectroscopy in different MAST-U divertor conditions are compared. The data includes variations of strike point position, core electron density, and heating power. The improved performance of the long-legged divertors results in a lower electron density and particle flux at the target compared to configurations with smaller strike point major radius, while also being characterized by lower temperatures and deeper detachment. Comparisons against SOLPS simulations generally show good agreement in profile shape along and across the separatrix. The peaking of the electron density downstream of the detachment front is associated with significant neutral drag acting on the plasma flow.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Core and Edge Mechanisms of the Density Limit in DIII-D Negative Triangularity Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density limit is investigated in the DIII-D negative triangularity (NT) plasmas which lack a standard H-mode edge. We find the limit may not be a singular disruptive boundary but a multifaceted density saturation phenomenon governed by distinct core and edge transport mechanisms. Sustained, non-disruptive operation is achieved at densities up to 1.8 times the Greenwald limit ($n_\mathrm{G}$) until the termination of auxiliary heating. Systematic power scans reveal distinct power scalings for the core ($n_e \propto P_\mathrm{SOL}^{0.27\pm0.03}$) and edge ($n_e \propto P_\mathrm{SOL}^{0.42\pm0.04}$) density limits. The edge density saturation is triggered abruptly by the onset of a non-disruptive, high-field side radiative instability that clamps the edge density below $n_\mathrm{G}$. In contrast, the core density continues to rise until it saturates, a state characterized by substantially enhanced core turbulence. Core transport evolves from a diffusive to an intermittent, avalanche-like state, as indicated by heavy-tailed probability density functions (kurtosis $\approx 6$), elevated Hurst exponents, and a $1/f$-type power spectrum. These findings suggest that the density limit in the low-confinement regime is determined by a combination of edge radiative instabilities and core turbulent transport. This distinction provides separate targets for control strategies aimed at extending the operational space of future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Bennett Vorticity: A family of nonlinear Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z-pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the current density of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the positive-definite structure of the nonlinearity's first derivative, in the ideal limit this equilibrium conforms globally to the validity criterion for a shear-flow stabilized Z-pinch when the form of the temperature profile satisfies certain constraints.</description>
