      <title>Fingerprints of a Non-Inflationary Universe from Massive Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of classical primordial standard clocks in an alternative to inflation, namely the slowly contracting ekpyrotic scenario. We study the phenomenology of massive spectator fields added to a state-of-the-art ekpyrotic model, with coupling functions that allow for these heavy fields to be classically excited while the background is slowly contracting. We perform numerical computations of the corrections to the scalar primordial power spectrum and compare with analytical estimates. Our full numerical results reveal so-called clock signals, sharp feature signals, as well as signals that link the two together. The models are found to predict oscillatory features that are resolutely different from what is calculated in inflation, and thus, such features represent unique fingerprints of a slowly contracting universe. This confirms the capability of primordial standard clocks to model-independently discriminate among very early universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bulk Flow Motion Detection in the Local Universe with Pantheon$+$ Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\em bulk flow} in the Local Universe is a collective phenomenon due to the peculiar motions of matter structures, which, instead of moving in random directions, appears to follow an approximate dipole velocity flow. We apply a directional analysis to investigate, through the Hubble-Lema\^{\i}tre diagram, the angular dependence of the Hubble constant $H_0$ of a sample of Type Ia Supernovae from the Pantheon+ catalog in the Local Universe ($0.015 \le z \le 0.06$). We perform a directional analysis that reveals a statistically significant dipole variation of $H_0$, at more than $99.9\%$ confidence level, showing that matter structures follow a dipole bulk flow motion towards $(l,b) = (326.^\circ1 \pm 11.^\circ2,27.^\circ8 \pm 11.^\circ2)$, close to the Shapley supercluster $(l_{\scalebox{0.6}{Shapley}},b_{\scalebox{0.6}{Shapley}}) = (311.^\circ5, 32.^\circ3)$, with velocity $132.14 \pm 109.3$ km s$^{-1}$ at the effective distance $102.83 \pm 10.2$~Mpc. Interestingly, the antipodal direction of this dipole points close to the Dipole Repeller structure. Our analyses confirm that the gravitational dipole system Shapley-Dipole Repeller explains well the observed bulk flow velocity field in the Local Universe. Furthermore, we performed robustness tests that support our results. Additionally, our approach provides a measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0 = 70.39 \pm 1.4$~\text{km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$}, at the effective distance $102.8$~Mpc, $z \simeq 0.025$.</description>

      <title>How do Primordial Black Holes change the Halo Mass Function and Structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semi-analytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around $10^6 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, constituting a fraction of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ of the dark matter (DM) in the universe, with the remainder being collision-less particle dark matter (PDM). Additionally, we conduct a $\Lambda$CDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers due to the `seed effect'. To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest-neighbor (NN) statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the $\Lambda$CDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly-formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than $\sim$$10^{-3}$, almost all newly-formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.</description>

      <title>Testing spatial curvature in an anisotropic extension of $w$CDM model with low redshift data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we report the observational constraints on a Bianchi type I anisotropic extension of $w$CDM model with spatial curvature from observational data including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic chronometers (CC), Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), Pantheon+ (PP) compilation of SNe Ia and SH0ES Cepheid host distance anchors. The anisotropy is found to be of the order $10^{-13}$, which interplay with spatial curvature to reduce $H_0$ tension by $\sim 1\sigma$ as found in the analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PP combination of data, while no significant effect of anisotropy is observed with BAO+CC+BBN+PPSH0ES combination of data. A closed Universe is favored by $w$CDM as well as anisotropic $w$CDM models with spatial curvature in analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PP combination of data. An observation of an open Universe from $w$CDM model with spatial curvature in analyses with BAO+CC+BBN+PPSH0ES combination of data and a closed Universe from anisotropic $w$CDM model with curvature in analyses with same combination of data is made. The quintessence form of dark energy is favored at 95\% CL in both analyses.</description>

      <title>Generalised conditions for rapid-turn inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid-turn slow-roll inflationary trajectories have been shown to be an attractor in two-field models, provided the turn rate is near constant and larger than the slow-roll parameters. These trajectories can produce primordial spectra consistent with current observations on CMB scales. We present the generalized consistency condition for sustained rapid-turn inflationary trajectory with two fields, arbitrary field-space metric and potential valid for any value of the turn rate. This has to be supplemented by a second condition to ensure slow roll evolution. Both conditions together constitute a tool to identify inflationary trajectories with arbitrary values of the turning rate without having to solve the equations of motion. We present a Python package for the numerical identification of regions in field-space and parameter space that allow for rapid-turn trajectories.</description>

      <title>Testing Gravity with Frequency-Dependent Overlap Reduction Function in Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The positive evidence of a nano-hertz gravitational wave background recently found by several pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations opened up a window to test modified gravity theories in a unique frequency band in parallel to other gravitational wave detection experiments. In particular, the overlap reduction function (ORF) in PTA observation is sensitive to the phase velocity of gravitational waves. In this work, we provide analytical expressions for the coefficients of the multipole moments in the ORF, and utilize these analytical results to study constraints on the phase velocity from the frequency dependent overlap reduction function obtained from the Chinese PTA (CPTA) data. While the data contain large error bars yet, interesting constraints are found in the frequency-dependent ORF in the case of subluminal phase velocity. This makes us expect that the nano-hertz band gravitational wave background will become one of the important arenas for exploring modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>DESI constraints on varying electron mass model and axion-like early dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) is one of the important standard ruler in cosmology. The results of the latest BAO measurements by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey has been reported. Cosmology with the varying electron mass model and the early dark energy (EDE) models are regraded as interesting models to resolve the Hubble tension. We present constraints on the varying electron mass model and EDE models by including new DESI data as well as cosmic microwave background by Planck and the conventional BAO data from 6dF, MGS, and DR12 and supernovae light curve data into analysis. Since new DESI BAO data indicates slightly longer sound horizon $r_dh$ than the other BAO observations, for the varying electron mass model, the larger $H_0 =69.44\pm 0.84 $ km$/$s$/$Mpc is indicated.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing of strong lensing: beyond the tidal regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of strong lensing images usually involves an external convergence and shear, which are meant to model the effect of perturbations along the line of sight, on top of the main lens. Such a description of line-of-sight perturbations supposes that the corresponding gravitational fields can be treated in the tidal regime. Going one step further introduces additional effects, known as flexion, which have been hitherto neglected in strong lensing. In this work, we build a minimal model for the line-of-sight flexion, which adds four new complex parameters to the lens model. Contrary to convergence and shear, the line-of-sight flexion cannot be projected onto the main lens plane. For a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we predict the typical line-of-sight flexion to be on the order of $10^{-3} \mathrm{arcsec}^{-1}$ on galactic scales. Neglecting its effect in lens modelling is found to bias the recovery of other parameters; in particular, the line-of-sight shear can be biased up to $2\sigma$. Accounting for the line-of-sight flexion in our minimal framework restores accuracy, at the the cost of degrading precision. With current imaging capabilities, the line-of-sight flexion is unlikely to be measurable on individual strong lensing images; it must therefore be considered a nuisance parameter rather than an observable in its own right.</description>

      <title>Absolute reference for microwave polarization experiments -- The COSMOCal project and its proof of concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB), a remnant of the Big Bang, provides unparalleled insights into the primordial universe, its energy content, and the origin of cosmic structures. The success of forthcoming terrestrial and space experiments hinges on meticulously calibrated data. Specifically, the ability to achieve an absolute calibration of the polarization angles with a precision of &lt; 0.1 deg is crucial to identify the signatures of primordial gravitational waves and cosmic birefringence within the CMB polarization. We introduce the COSMOCal project, designed to deploy a polarized source in space for calibrating microwave frequency observations. The project aims to integrate microwave polarization observations from small and large telescopes, ground-based and in space, into a unified scale, enhancing the effectiveness of each observatory and allowing robust combination of data. To demonstrate the feasibility and confirm the observational approach of our project, we developed a prototype instrument that operates in the atmospheric window centered at 260 GHz, specifically tailored for use with the NIKA2 camera at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We present the instrument components and their laboratory characterization. The results of tests performed with the fully assembled prototype using a KIDs-based instrument, similar concept of NIKA2, are also reported. This study paves the way for an observing campaign using the IRAM 30m telescope and contributes to the development of a space-based instrument.</description>

      <title>2D vs. 3D BAO: quantification of their tension and test of the Etherington relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several studies in the literature have found a disagreement between data on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) derived using two distinct methodologies: the two-dimensional (2D or angular) BAO, which extracts the BAO signal from the analysis of the angular two-point correlation function; and the three-dimensional (3D or anisotropic) BAO, which also exploits the radial clustering signal imprinted on the large-scale structure of the universe. This discrepancy is worrisome, since many of the points contained in these data sets are obtained from the same catalogs of tracers and, therefore, we would expect them to be consistent. Since BAO measurements play a pivotal role in the building of the inverse distance ladder, this mismatch impacts the discourse on the Hubble tension and the theoretical solutions to the latter. So far, the discrepancy between 2D and 3D BAO has been only pointed out in the context of fitting analyses of cosmological models or parametrizations that involve a concrete calibration of the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch. In this Letter, we avoid the use of any calibration and cosmological model in the process. At this point we assume that the Etherington (a.k.a distance duality) relation holds. We use state-of-the-art measurements in our analysis, and study how the results change when the angular components of the 3D BAO data from BOSS/eBOSS are substituted by the recent data from DESI Y1. We find the tension to exist at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$ and $\sim 2.5\sigma$, respectively. We then apply a calibrator-independent method to investigate the robustness of the distance duality relation when analyzed not only with 3D BAO measurements, but also with 2D BAO. We do not find any hint for a violation of the cosmic distance duality relation in any of the considered data sets, although they leave still room for departures from it. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Comparing sharp and smooth transition of the second slow-roll parameter in single-field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In single-field inflation, violation of the slow-roll approximation can lead to growth of curvature perturbation outside the horizon. This violation is characterized by a period with a large negative value of the second slow-roll parameter. At an early time, inflation must satisfy the slow-roll approximation, so the large-scale curvature perturbation can explain the cosmic microwave background fluctuations. At intermediate time, it is viable to have a theory that violates the slow-roll approximation, which implies amplification of the curvature perturbation on small scales. Specifically, we consider ultraslow-roll inflation as the intermediate period. At late time, inflation should go back to the slow roll period so that it can end. This means that there are two transitions of the second slow-roll parameter. In this paper, we compare two different possibilities for the second transition: sharp and smooth transitions. Focusing on effects generated by the relevant cubic self-interaction of the curvature perturbation, we find that the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum due to the change of the second slow-roll parameter vanish if and only if the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for perturbation satisfies a specific condition called Wands duality. We also find in the case of sharp transition that, even though this duality is satisfied in the ultraslow-roll and slow-roll phases, it is severely violated at the transition so that the resultant one-loop correction is extremely large inversely proportional to the duration of the transition.</description>

      <title>Generating large primordial fluctuations in single-field inflation for PBH formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to produce appreciable amount of primordial black holes (PBHs), the square amplitude of curvature perturbation must take a large value of $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$, namely, seven digits larger than the value observed by cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) on large scales. Such a large fluctuation can be achieved by violating slow-roll (SR) condition within a short duration. The best known of such possibilities is the ultraslow-roll (USR) inflation. We calculate the power spectrum of curvature perturbation in a simple single-field inflation model which evolves through SR-USR-SR regimes so that both large-amplitude small-scale fluctuation for PBH formation and small-amplitude large-scale fluctuation as observed by CMB are realized. We further calculate the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum induced by the third-order action of curvature perturbation as the beginning of precision cosmology on small scale. As a result we show that single-field inflation model realizing PBH formation is severely constrained by the quantum correction.</description>

      <title>Radiative transfer of 21-cm line through ionised cavities in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical depth parameterisation is typically used to study the 21-cm signals associated with the properties of the neutral hydrogen (HI) gas and the ionisation morphology during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR), without solving the radiative transfer equation. To assess the uncertainties resulting from this simplification, we conduct explicit radiative transfer calculations using the cosmological 21-cm radiative transfer (C21LRT) code and examine the imprints of ionisation structures on the 21-cm spectrum. We consider a globally averaged reionisation history and implement fully ionised cavities (HII bubbles) of diameters $d$ ranging from 0.01 Mpc to 10 Mpc at epochs within the emission and the absorption regimes of the 21-cm global signal. The single-ray C21LRT calculations show that the shape of the imprinted spectral features are primarily determined by $d$ and the 21-cm line profile, which is parametrised by the turbulent velocity of the HI gas. It reveals the spectral features tied to the transition from ionised to neutral regions that calculations based on the optical depth parametrisation were unable to capture. We also present analytical approximations of the calculated spectral features of the HII bubbles. The multiple-ray calculations show that the apparent shape of a HII bubble (of $d=5$ Mpc at $z=8$), because of the finite speed of light, differs depending on whether the bubble's ionisation front is stationary or expanding. Our study shows the necessity of properly accounting for the effects of line-continuum interaction, line broadening and cosmological expansion to correctly predict the EoR 21-cm signals.</description>

      <title>CMB-HD as a Probe of Dark Matter on Sub-Galactic Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show for the first time that high-resolution CMB lensing observations can probe structure on sub-galactic scales. In particular, a CMB-HD experiment can probe out to k ~ 55 h/Mpc, corresponding to halo masses of about $10^8 M_{\odot}$. Over the range 0.005 h/Mpc &lt; k &lt; 55 h/Mpc, spanning four orders of magnitude, the total lensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from the temperature, polarization, and lensing power spectra is greater than 1900. CMB-HD gains most of the lensing SNR at small scales from the temperature power spectrum, as opposed to the lensing spectrum. These lensing measurements allow CMB-HD to distinguish between cold dark matter (CDM) and non-CDM models that change the matter power spectrum on sub-galactic scales. We also find that CMB-HD can distinguish between baryonic feedback effects and non-CDM models due to the different way each impacts the lensing signal. The kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) power spectrum further constrains non-CDM models that deviate from CDM on the smallest scales CMB-HD measures. For example, CMB-HD can detect 1 keV warm dark matter (WDM) at 30$\sigma$, or rule out about 7 keV WDM at 95% CL, in a $\Lambda$WDM + $N_{\rm{eff}} + \sum m_\nu + m_{\rm{WDM}} + \log_{10}T_{\rm{AGN}} + A_{\rm{kSZ}} + n_{\rm{kSZ}}$ model; here $T_{\rm{AGN}}$ characterizes the strength of the feedback, and $A_{\rm{kSZ}}$ and $n_{\rm{kSZ}}$ allow freedom in the amplitude and slope of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum. We make the CMB-HD Fisher code used here publicly available, and note that it can be modified to use any non-CDM model that changes the matter power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Holographic massive plasma state in Friedman Universe: cosmological fine-tuning and coincidence problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15488v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive particle and antiparticle pair production and oscillation on the horizon form a holographic and massive pair plasma state in the Friedman Universe. Via this state, the Einstein cosmology term (dark energy) interacts with matter and radiation and is time-varying $\tilde\Lambda$ in the Universe's evolution. It is determined by a close set of ordinary differential equations for dark energy, matter, and radiation energy densities. The solutions are unique, provided the initial conditions given by observations. In inflation and reheating, dark energy density decreases from the inflation scale, converting to matter and radiation energy densities. In standard cosmology, matter and radiation energy densities convert to dark energy density, reaching the present Universe. By comparing with $\Lambda$CDM, quintessence and dark energy interacting models, we show that these results can be the possible solutions for cosmological fine-tuning and coincidence problems.</description>

Abstract: Needed for cosmological and stellar nucleosynthesis, we are studying the closed-form analytic evaluation of thermonuclear reaction rates. In this context, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of three distinct velocity distributions, namely the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the pathway distribution, and the Mittag-Leffer distribution.

      <description>arXiv:2405.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of probing massive fields and testing gravitational theories with multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from coalescing compact binaries. Focusing on the dipole radiation induced by a massive field, we show that multi-band observations can probe the field with mass ranging from $10^{-16}$ eV to $10^{-15}$ eV, a parameter space that cannot be probed by the milli-Hertz band observations alone. Multi-band observations can also improve the constraints obtained with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries by up to 3 orders of magnitude in the mass range. Moreover, we show that multi-band observations can discriminate the spin of the field, which cannot be identified with single-band observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies, in the context of consistency conditions for rapid-turn and third order slow-roll inflation in two-field models, raised the question whether this regime can be sustained for more than a few e-folds of expansion. We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the consistency conditions themselves ensure the longevity of the rapid-turn regime. Furthermore, we prove this for the most general definition of rapid turning (i.e., with a turning rate that is large compared to the slow-roll parameters, but not necessarily large compared to unity), using in the process a generalized consistency condition. We also show that a special class of rapid-turn models, including angular inflation, satisfy a large-(compared to $1$)-turn-rate condition even for non-large turning rates.</description>

      <title>Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicates a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background (CMB), weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and redshift-space distortions (RSD) data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inhomogeneities, primordial black holes, and a hypothesis on the death of the universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the expansion of the universe on a broad class of objects, including black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, and others. Using metrics that incorporate primordial inhomogeneities, the effects of a hypothetical "center of the universe" on inflation are calculated. Dynamic coordinates for black holes that account for expansions or contractions with arbitrary rates are provided. We consider the possibility that the universe may be bound to evolve into an ultimate state of "total dilution", wherein stable particles are so widely separated that physical communication among them will be impossible for eternity. This is also a scenario of "cosmic virtuality", as no wave-function collapse would occur again. We provide classical models evolving this way, based on the Majumdar-Papapetrou geometries. More realistic configurations, instead, indicate that gravitational forces locally counteract expansion, except in the universe's early stages. We comment on whether quantum phenomena may dictate that total dilution is indeed the cosmos' ultimate destiny.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has initiated a program to enhance the participation of historically underrepresented institutions and communities in NASA's mission. Currently known as the NASA SMD Bridge Program, its goal is to establish enduring partnerships among these institutions, research-intensive universities, and NASA centers. There are concerns about using "Bridge" in the program's name, with stakeholders suggesting that it might stigmatize students and mislead applicants about its focus. In this white paper, we address these concerns and conclude that a name change that better reflects the mission of this SMD effort is necessary to address these concerns.</description>

      <title>Recovering 21cm Monopole Signals Without Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expect the monopole signal at the lowest frequencies below $100\,$MHz to be composed of two components: the deep Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background and two distinct features: the dark ages trough at $\sim 17\,$MHz and the cosmic dawn trough at $\sim 75\,$Mhz. These are hidden under orders of magnitude brighter foregrounds whose emission is approximately a power-law with a spectral index $\approx -2.5$. It is usually assumed that monopole signals of interest are separable from foregrounds based on spectral smoothness. We argue that this is a difficult approach and likely impossible for the Dark Ages trough. Instead, we suggest that the fluctuations in the foreground emission around the sky should be used to build a model distribution of possible shapes of foregrounds, which can be used to constrain the presence of a monopole signal. We implement this idea using normalizing flows and show that this technique allows for efficient unsupervised detection of the amplitude, width, and center of the Dark Ages trough as well as the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background for a sufficiently sensitive experiment. We show that achromatic and smooth response significantly helps with foreground separation. We discuss the limitations of the inherent assumptions in this method and the impact on the design of future low-frequency experiments.</description>

      <title>A cosmic glitch in gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model that modifies general relativity on cosmological scales, specifically by having a `glitch' in the gravitational constant between the cosmological (super-horizon) and Newtonian (sub-horizon) regimes, as motivated e.g. in the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz proposal or in the Einstein-aether framework. This gives a single-parameter extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, which is equivalent to adding a dark energy component, but where the energy density of this component can have either sign. Fitting to data from the Planck satellite, we find that negative contributions are, in fact, preferred. Additionally, we find that roughly one percent weaker superhorizon gravity can somewhat ease the Hubble and clustering tensions in a range of cosmological observations, although at the expense of spoiling fits to the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale in galaxy surveys. Therefore, the extra parametric freedom offered by our model deserves further exploration, and we discuss how future observations may elucidate this potential cosmic glitch in gravity, through a four-fold reduction in statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>CMB lensing from early-formed dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some theoretical models for the early Universe predict a spike-type enhancement in the primordial power spectrum on a small scale, which would result in forming early-formed dark matter halos~(EFHs). Some recent studies have claimed to have placed limits on such small scales, which, however, involve uncertainties, such as the physics of substructures and the halo-galaxy relations. In this work, we study the cosmic microwave background~(CMB) lensing effect, considering the existence of EFHs, and investigate the potential to probe the EFHs and the primordial perturbations on scales smaller than $1\mathrm{Mpc}$, complementing these previous studies. We numerically calculate the angular power spectrum of the lensing potential and the lensed CMB anisotropy of temperature, E-mode, and B-mode polarization, including the nonlinear effects of EFHs. We find the possibility that the lensed CMB temperature anisotropy is significantly enhanced on small scales, $\ell&gt;1000$, and could be tested by component decomposition of observed signals through multifrequency observations. Through the calculation with different models of the spiky-type power spectrum, we demonstrate that the accurate measurements of the CMB lensing effect would provide insight into the abundance of EFHs within the limited mass range around $10^{11}~M_\odot$ and the primordial power spectrum on the limited scales around $k\sim 1\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In particular, we find that the existence of such EFHs can amplify the lensed anisotropy of CMB B-mode polarization even on large scales, $\ell &lt;100$, as the overall enhancement by $\sim 5 \%$ level compared to the standard structure formation model without EFHs. Therefore, future CMB measurements, such as the LiteBIRD satellite, can probe the existence of the EFHs and the spike-type primordial power spectrum through the precise measurement of the large-scale CMB B-mode polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble tension has proven to be stubbornly persistent, despite widespread efforts to relax it. As a possible resolution of this problem we propose a radical alternative to the way in which cosmological models are viewed. Specifically, we consider building cosmological models from spaces that exhibit intrinsic symmetries, rather than as space-times with explicit symmetry. This change in perspective allows statistical homogeneity and isotropy to be maintained, while relaxing some strong mathematical constraints that the standard approach imposes. We show that a Hubble tension arises naturally in our new approach, and that (as a corollary) a prediction can be made for the radial component of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Our prediction appears to be consistent with the DESI first-year data release, which has otherwise been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension tomography: BAO vs SnIa distance tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble tension by comparing the luminosity distances obtained using an up-to-date BAO dataset (including the latest DESI data) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon+ SnIa distances calibrated with Cepheids. Using a redshift tomography method, we find: 1) The BAO-inferred distances are discrepant with the Pantheon+ SnIa distances across all redshift bins considered, with the discrepancy level varying with redshift. 2) The distance discrepancy is more pronounced at lower redshifts ($z \in [0.1,0.8]$) compared to higher redshifts ($z\in [0.8,2.3]$). The consistency of $\Lambda$CDM best fit parameters obtained in high and low redshift bins of both BAO and SnIa samples is investigated and we confirm that the tension reduces at high redshifts. Also a mild tension between the redshift bins is identified at higher redshifts for both the BAO and Pantheon+ data with respect to the best fit value of $H_0$ in agreement with previous studies which find hints for an 'evolution' of $H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. These results confirm that the low redshift BAO and SnIa distances can only become consistent through a re-evaluation of the distance calibration methods. An $H(z)$ expansion rate deformation alone is insufficient to resolve the tension. Our findings also hint at a possible deviation of the expansion rate from the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$. We show that such a deformation is well described by a high redshift transition of $H(z)$ like the one expressed by $\Lambda_s$CDM even though this alone cannot fully resolve the Hubble tension due to its tension with intermediate/low $z$ BAO data.</description>

      <title>Constraining the nonstandard propagating gravitational waves in the cosmological background with GWTC-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the fundamental nature of gravity. We present constraints on the nonstandard propagation of GWs using the spectral siren method applied to binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3). The spectral siren method exploits the redshift distribution of BBHs to probe the cosmic expansion history and break degeneracies between cosmology and modified gravity effects. We focus on the friction term $\nu$ in the nonstandard GW propagation equation, which characterizes the running of the Planck mass. Assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find $\nu = 0.5^{+3.5}_{-2.6}$ (median and $90\%$ credible interval), improving upon previous constraints from the bright siren event GW170817 by an order of magnitude. This improvement is due to the higher redshifts of BBHs in GWTC-3, reaching up to $z \sim 1$. Our result suggests that the propagation of GWs is consistent with the predictions of general relativity, placing limits on modified gravity theories that predict a time-varying Planck mass. As the sensitivity of GW detectors improves, the spectral siren method will provide a powerful tool for testing gravity on cosmological scales and probing the physics of the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: The most widely studied formation mechanism of a primordial black hole is collapse of large-amplitude perturbation on small scales generated in single-field inflation. In this Letter, we calculate one-loop correction to the large-scale power spectrum in a model with sharp transition of the second slow-roll parameter. We find that models producing an appreciable amount of primordial black holes induce nonperturbative coupling on a large scale probed by cosmic microwave background radiation. Our result implies that a small-scale power spectrum can be constrained by large-scale cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes can be formed from the collapse of large-amplitude perturbation on small scales in the early Universe. Such an enhanced spectrum can be realized by introducing a flat region in the potential of single-field inflation, which makes the inflaton go into a temporary ultraslow-roll period. In this paper, we calculate the bispectrum of curvature perturbation in such a scenario. We explicitly confirm that bispectrum satisfies Maldacena's theorem. At the end of the ultraslow-roll period, the bispectrum is generated by bulk interaction and field redefinition. At the end of inflation, bispectrum is generated only by bulk interaction. We also calculate the one-loop correction to the power spectrum from the bispectrum, called the source method. We find it consistent with the calculation of the one-loop correction from the second-order expansion of in-in perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: The experiment involving the entanglement of two massive particles through gravitational fields has been devised to discern the quantum attributes of gravity. In this paper, we present a scheme to extend this experiment's applicability to more generalized curved spacetimes, with the objective of validating universal quantum gravity within broader contexts. Specifically, we direct our attention towards the quantum gravity induced entanglement of mass (QGEM) in astrophysical phenomena, such as particles traversing the interstellar medium. Notably, we ascertain that the gravitational field within curved spacetime can induce observable entanglement between particle pairs in both scenarios, even when dealing with particles significantly smaller than mesoscopic masses. Furthermore, we obtain the characteristic spectra of QGEM across diverse scenarios, shedding light on potential future experimental examinations. This approach not only establishes a more pronounced and extensive manifestation of the quantum influences of gravity compared to the original scheme but also opens avenues for prospective astronomical experiments. These experiments, aligned with our postulates, hold immense advantages and implications for the detection of quantum gravity and can be envisioned for future design.</description>

Abstract: In our previous work, we have explored quantum gravity induced entanglement of mass (QGEM) in curved spacetime, observing entanglement formation between particles moving along geodesics in a Schwarzschild spacetime background. We find that long interaction time induces entanglement, even for particles with microscopic mass, addressing decoherence concerns. In this work, we build upon our previous work by extending our investigation to a time-dependent spacetime. Specifically, we explore the entanglement induced by the mutual gravitation of massive particles in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker(FLRW) universe. Through calculations of the phase variation and the QGEM spectrum, our proposed scheme offers a potential method for observing the formation of entanglement caused by the quantum gravity of massive particles as they propagate in the FLRW universe. Consequently, our research provides fresh insights into the field of entanglement in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Mixed scalarization of charged black holes: from spontaneous to non-linear scalarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalarized black holes (BH) have been shown to form dynamically in extended-scalar-tensor theories, either through spontaneous scalarization -- when the BH is unstable against linear perturbations -- or through a non-linear scalarization. In the latter, linearly stable BHs can ignite scalarization when sufficiently perturbed. These phenomena are, however, not incompatible and mixed scalarization is also possible. We explore two aspects of the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar model: solutions containing, simultaneously, linear (\textit{aka} standard) and non-linear scalarization; and the effects of having one of the coupling constants with an 'opposite sign' to the one leading to scalarization. Both points are addressed by constructing and examining the mixed scalarization's domain of existence. An overall dominance of the spontaneous scalarization over the non-linear scalarization is observed. Thermodynamically, an entropical preference for mixed over the standard scalarization (spontaneous or non-linear) exists. In the presence of counter scalarization, a quench of the scalarization occurs, mimicking the effect of a scalar particle's mass/positive self-interaction term.</description>

      <title>Search for heavy dark matter from dwarf spheroidal galaxies: leveraging cascades and subhalo models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) has been widely used to search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter signals due to its unparalleled sensitivity in the GeV energy band. The leading constraints for WIMP by Fermi-LAT are obtained from the analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies within the Local Group, which are compelling targets for dark matter searches due to their relatively low astrophysical backgrounds and high dark matter content. In the meantime, the search for heavy dark matter with masses above TeV remains a compelling and relatively unexplored frontier. In this study, we utilize 14-year Fermi-LAT data to search for dark matter annihilation and decay signals in 8 classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies within the Local Group. We consider secondary emission caused by electromagnetic cascades of prompt gamma rays and electrons/positrons from dark matter, which enables us to extend the search with Fermi-LAT to heavier dark matter cases. We also update the dark matter subhalo model with informative priors respecting the fact that they reside in subhalos of our Milky Way halo aiming to enhance the robustness of our results. We place constraints on dark matter annihilation cross section and decay lifetime for dark matter masses ranging from $10^3$ GeV to $10^{11}$ GeV, where our limits are more stringent than those obtained by many other high-energy gamma-ray instruments.</description>

      <title>Angular and radial stabilities of spontaneously scalarized black holes in the presence of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of spontaneously scalarized black holes (BHs) induced by a scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant $R_{\rm GB}^2$. For the scalar-GB coupling $\xi(\phi)=(\eta/8) (\phi^2+\alpha \phi^4)$, where $\eta$ and $\alpha$ are constants, we first show that there are no angular Laplacian instabilities of even-parity perturbations far away from the horizon for large multipoles $l \gg 1$. The deviation of angular propagation speeds from the speed of light is largest on the horizon, whose property can be used to put constraints on the model parameters. For $\alpha \gtrsim -1$, the region in which the scalarized BH is subject to angular Laplacian instabilities can emerge. Provided that $\alpha \lesssim -1$ and $-1/2&lt;\alpha \phi_0^2&lt;-0.1155$, where $\phi_0$ is the field value on the horizon with a unit of the reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}=1$, there are scalarized BH solutions satisfying all the linear stability conditions throughout the horizon exterior. We also study the stability of spontaneously scalarized BHs in scalar-GB theories with a nonminimal coupling $-\beta \phi^2 R/16$, where $\beta$ is a positive constant and $R$ is a Ricci scalar. As the amplitude of the field on the horizon approaches an upper limit $|\phi_0|=4/\sqrt{\beta}$, one of the squared angular propagation speeds $c_{\Omega-}^2$ enters the instability region $c_{\Omega-}^2&lt;0$. So long as $|\phi_0|$ is smaller than a maximum value determined for each $\beta$ in the range $\beta&gt;5$, however, the scalarized BHs are linearly stable in both angular and radial directions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Inflation with Null Energy Condition Violation from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The null energy condition (NEC) is a cornerstone of general relativity, and its violation could leave observable imprints in the cosmic gravitational wave spectrum. Theoretical models suggest that NEC violations during inflation can amplify the primordial tensor power spectrum, leading to distinct features in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we search for these NEC-violating signatures in the SGWB using data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's first three observing runs. Our analysis reveals no statistically significant evidence of such signals, allowing us to place stringent upper limits on the tensor power spectrum amplitude, $P_{T,2}$, during the second inflationary stage. Specifically, we find that $P_{T,2} \lesssim 0.15$ at a $95\%$ confidence level. Notably, this upper limit is consistent with constraints derived from pulsar timing array observations, reinforcing the hypothesis that NEC violations during inflation could explain the signal detected by pulsar timing arrays. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the early Universe and highlight the potential of current and future gravitational wave experiments in probing the physics of inflation and NEC violations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced primordial gravitational waves from a stiff post-inflationary era due to an oscillating inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of inflationary models, which lead to a stiff period after inflation that boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). In both families of models studied, we consider an oscillating scalar condensate, which when far away from the minimum it is overdamped by a warped kinetic term, a la $\alpha$-attractors. This leads to successful inflation. The oscillating condensate is in danger of becoming fragmented by resonant effects when non-linearities take over. Consequently, the stiff phase cannot be prolonged enough to enhance primordial GWs at frequencies observable in the near future for low orders of the envisaged scalar potential. However, this is not the case for a higher-order scalar potential. Indeed, we show that this case results in a boosted GW spectrum that overlaps with future observations without generating too much GW radiation to de-stabilise Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. For example, taking $\alpha={\cal O}(1)$, we find that the GW signal can be safely enhanced up to $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)\sim 10^{-11}$ at frequency $f\sim 10^2\,$Hz, which will be observable by the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our mechanism ends up with a characteristic GW spectrum, which if observed, can lead to the determination of the inflation energy scale, the reheating temperature and the shape (steepness) of the scalar potential around the minimum.</description>

      <title>BBN catalysis by doubly charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider primordial nucleosynthesis in the presence of hypothetical quasi-stable doubly charged particles. Existence of $X^{--}$ with macroscopic lifetimes will lead to the formation of its bound states with $^4$He and other light elements, significantly facilitating the subsequent formation of lithium nuclei. From observational constraints on maximum allowable amount of lithium, that we update in this work, we derive strong constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X^{--}$. In a likely cosmological freeze-out scenario with temperatures initially exceeding the mass of $X^{--}$, the BBN constrains the lifetime of these particles to be less than about 100 seconds. For parametrically long lifetimes, lithium abundance data constrain $X^{--}$ abundance to be less than $10^{-9}$ relative to protons, regardless of whether these particles decay or remain stable. Stable particles could saturate the dark matter density only if their mass is comparable to or in excess of $10^{10}$ GeV, and most of $X^{--}$ will be found in bound states with beryllium nuclei, so that chemically they would appear as abnormally heavy helium isotopes.</description>
