      <title>A Closed-Form Design Method for U-Shaped Springs in Aeroelastic Modeling of Truss-Girder Suspension Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aeroelastic model testing is essential for evaluating the wind resistance performance of long-span suspension bridges. In these models, truss girders are commonly modelled by a discrete-stiffness system incorporating U-shaped springs to simulate elastic stiffness properties, including vertical bending, lateral bending, and torsional rigidity. The design of these U-shaped springs significantly influences the accuracy of aeroelastic model tests for truss-girder suspension bridges. Traditional design approaches, however, lack an analytical foundation, relying instead on trial-and-error searches across the full parameter space, which is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel design method that establishes closed-form equations for U-shaped spring design. The method simplifies the truss girder's supporting condition to a cantilever configuration and determines the corresponding elastic stiffness using the principle of elastic-strain energy equivalence. These closed-form equations transform the design process into a non-smooth optimization problem, accounting for precision constraints inherent in practical fabrication. Derivative-free optimization algorithms, including the Nelder-Mead method, Pattern Search method, and Genetic Algorithm, are employed to identify a globally optimal solution. The proposed method is validated through its application to a representative suspension bridge with a truss girder, with numerical and experimental results confirming its accuracy and reliability. This approach enhances aeroelastic model design techniques for long-span bridges by providing a theoretical framework for the design of U-shaped spring, reducing the optimization process to several seconds.</description>

      <title>Surface mobility of a glass-forming polymer in an ionic liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free surface of glassy polymers exhibits enhanced segmental dynamics compared to the bulk, forming a liquid-like layer that lowers the glass transition temperature (Tg) in nanometersized polymer samples. Recent studies have shown that immersing polymers in ionic liquids can suppress this enhanced surface dynamics. To investigate how ionic liquids influence polymer dynamics near the ionic-liquid-polymer interface, we measure the surface leveling of nanometersized stepped polystyrene films immersed in ionic liquids, and compared the results to the case of films in vacuum. Our results reveal that ionic liquids significantly slow the leveling process both above and below Tg. However, our results indicate that the liquid-like surface layer below Tg does exist in ionic liquids. Numerical solutions of the thin-film equation, incorporating appropriate boundary conditions, show that the surface mobility of PS films in ionic liquids can match that of PS films in vacuum. Thus, while ionic liquids alter the polymer flow process, they do not eliminate the dynamical heterogeneity inherent to glassy polymers.</description>

      <title>Temporal Effective Medium for Programmable Acoustic Metamaterials with Multiple Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend effective medium theory (EMT) to time-modulated, frequency-dispersive acoustic metamaterials with multiple resonances. While previous studies focused on non-dispersive or single-resonance systems, advances in programmable materials now enable precise control of time-varying responses. We derive explicit averaging rules that account for the interplay between resonant and modulation frequencies. When resonant frequencies are much lower than the modulation frequency, modulating the resonant strength yields the temporal average of monopolar susceptibility \c{hi}, while modulating the resonant frequency results in the average of 1/\c{hi}, applied per resonance mode. In hybrid cases, high-frequency resonances (relative to modulation) can be renormalized as a non-dispersive background before averaging the rest. This generalized temporal EMT offers a unified framework for designing compact, topologically robust, and non-Hermitian acoustic devices, leveraging the possible programmability of time-dependent material parameters in future.</description>
