      <title>BMFM-DNA: A SNP-aware DNA foundation model to capture variant effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on text demonstrated remarkable results on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models have been adapted to decipher the language of DNA, where sequences of nucleotides act as "words" that encode genomic functions. However, the genome differs fundamentally from natural language, as it lacks clearly defined words or a consistent grammar. Although DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved high level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do not encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To address this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate sequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as they underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT to pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely, BMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths along with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and BMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel representation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate that integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological functions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the model's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP imputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we acknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully evaluate these models. To enable more comprehensive assessment in the future and encourage community contributions, we release our models through HuggingFace and the code to reproduce the results at https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic</description>

      <title>A Statistical Framework for Co-Mediators of Zero-Inflated Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed molecular profiling at the individual cell level. However, integrating high-dimensional single-cell data into causal mediation analysis remains challenging due to zero inflation and complex mediator structures. We propose a novel mediation framework leveraging zero-inflated negative binomial models to characterize cell-level mediator distributions and beta regression for zero-inflation proportions. Subject-level mediators are aggregated from cell-level data to perform mediation analysis assessing causal pathways linking gene expression to clinical outcomes. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate improved power and controlled false discovery rates. We further illustrate the utility of this approach through application to ROSMAP single-cell transcriptomic data, uncovering biologically meaningful mediation effects that enhance understanding of disease mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Classification of autoimmune diseases from Peripheral blood TCR repertoires by multimodal multi-instance learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes. The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories, utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across immune-mediated conditions.</description>
