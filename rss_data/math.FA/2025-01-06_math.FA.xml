      <title>On coarse geometry of separable dual Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the obstructions to coarse universality in separable dual Banach spaces. We prove an `asymptotic linearization' theorem for nonlinear maps into Banach spaces and use it to give streamlined proofs of several results in the literature. We also prove coarse non-universality of several classes of dual spaces, including those with conditional spreading bases, as well as generalized James and James tree spaces. Furthermore, we give quantitative counterparts of some of the results, clarifying the distinction between coarse non-universality and the non-equi-coarse embeddings of the Kalton graphs.</description>

      <title>Compressed sensing for inverse problems II: applications to deconvolution, source recovery, and MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the sample complexity theory for ill-posed inverse problems developed in a recent work by the authors [`Compressed sensing for inverse problems and the sample complexity of the sparse Radon transform', J. Eur. Math. Soc., to appear], which was originally focused on the sparse Radon transform. We demonstrate that the underlying abstract framework, based on infinite-dimensional compressed sensing and generalized sampling techniques, can effectively handle a variety of practical applications. Specifically, we analyze three case studies: (1) The reconstruction of a sparse signal from a finite number of pointwise blurred samples; (2) The recovery of the (sparse) source term of an elliptic partial differential equation from finite samples of the solution; and (3) A moderately ill-posed variation of the classical sensing problem of recovering a wavelet-sparse signal from finite Fourier samples, motivated by magnetic resonance imaging. For each application, we establish rigorous recovery guarantees by verifying the key theoretical requirements, including quasi-diagonalization and coherence bounds. Our analysis reveals that careful consideration of balancing properties and optimized sampling strategies can lead to improved reconstruction performance. The results provide a unified theoretical foundation for compressed sensing approaches to inverse problems while yielding practical insights for specific applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to two classes of Banach spaces defined with the aid of variations: Waterman spaces and Chanturia classes. Our method is based on some ideas coming from the theory of ideals on the set of natural numbers.</description>

      <title>Finitely $C^\infty$-generated associative and Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebras, which can be treated as `algebras of functions' on non-commutative $C^\infty$-differentiable spaces. Our approach uses the category of projective limits of real Banach algebras of polynomial growth. We prove the existence of some universal constructions in this and some similar categories. By analogy with holomorphically finitely generated algebras of Pirkovskii, a finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebra is defined as a quotient of a finite-rank algebra of `free $C^\infty$-functions'. The latter notion was introduced by the author in a previous article, where a structure theorem for algebras of `free $C^\infty$-functions' was announced and proved in dimension at most $2$. Here this theorem is proved in full generality.
  The central result asserts that the projective tensor product of a finite tuple of finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebras is finitely $C^\infty$-generated. In particular, this makes it natural to consider finitely $C^\infty$-generated topological Hopf algebras. Furthermore, a construction called `envelope' provides a functor from the category of affine real Hopf algebras to the category of finitely $C^\infty$-generated Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Lipschitz mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the notion of modulus of continuity at a point of a mapping between metric spaces, we introduce the notion of extensively bounded mappings generalizing that of Lipschitz mappings. We also introduce a metric on it which becomes a norm if the codomain is a normed linear space. We study its basic properties. We also discuss a linearization of an extensively bounded mapping into a bounded linear mapping. As an application, we introduce the notion of extensively bounded operator ideals. We also discuss extensively bounded finite rank and extensively bounded compact mappings and their corresponding operator ideals.</description>

      <title>Compactness in spaces of functions of bounded variation from ideal perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently we have presented a unified approach to two classes of Banach spaces defined by means of variations (Waterman spaces and Chanturia classes), utilizing the concepts from the theory of ideals on the set of natural numbers. We defined correspondence between an ideal on the set of natural numbers, a certain sequence space and related space of functions of bounded variation. In this paper, following these ideas, we give characterizations of compact embeddings between different Waterman spaces and between different Chanturia classes: both in terms of sequences defining these function spaces and in terms of properties of ideals corresponding to these function spaces.</description>

      <title>The log-Sobolev inequality for spin systems of higher order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.11980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the infinite-dimensional log-Sobolev inequality for spin systems on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with interactions of power higher than quadratic. We assume that the one site measure without a boundary $e^{-\phi(x)}dx/Z$ satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality and we determine conditions so that the infinite-dimensional Gibbs measure also satisfies the inequality. As a concrete application, we prove that a certain class of nontrivial Gibbs measures with non-quadratic interaction potentials on an infinite product of Heisenberg groups satisfy the log-Sobolev inequality.</description>
