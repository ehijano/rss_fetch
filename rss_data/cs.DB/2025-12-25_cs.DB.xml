      <title>MarineEval: Assessing the Marine Intelligence of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have witnessed promising progress led by large language models (LLMs) and further vision language models (VLMs) in handling various queries as a general-purpose assistant. VLMs, as a bridge to connect the visual world and language corpus, receive both visual content and various text-only user instructions to generate corresponding responses. Though great success has been achieved by VLMs in various fields, in this work, we ask whether the existing VLMs can act as domain experts, accurately answering marine questions, which require significant domain expertise and address special domain challenges/requirements. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs. During our dataset construction, we ensure the diversity and coverage of the constructed data: 7 task dimensions and 20 capacity dimensions. The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements. We hope our new benchmark and observations will facilitate future research. Project Page: http://marineeval.hkustvgd.com/</description>

      <title>An Allele-Centric Pan-Graph-Matrix Representation for Scalable Pangenome Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population-scale pangenome analysis increasingly requires representations that unify single-nucleotide and structural variation while remaining scalable across large cohorts. Existing formats are typically sequence-centric, path-centric, or sample-centric, and often obscure population structure or fail to exploit carrier sparsity. We introduce the H1 pan-graph-matrix, an allele-centric representation that encodes exact haplotype membership using adaptive per-allele compression. By treating alleles as first-class objects and selecting optimal encodings based on carrier distribution, H1 achieves near-optimal storage across both common and rare variants. We further introduce H2, a path-centric dual representation derived from the same underlying allele-haplotype incidence information that restores explicit haplotype ordering while remaining exactly equivalent in information content. Using real human genome data, we show that this representation yields substantial compression gains, particularly for structural variants, while remaining equivalent in information content to pangenome graphs. H1 provides a unified, population-aware foundation for scalable pangenome analysis and downstream applications such as rare-variant interpretation and drug discovery.</description>
