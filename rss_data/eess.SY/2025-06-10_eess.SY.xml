      <title>A Koopman-backstepping approach to data-driven robust output regulation for linear parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a solution of the data-driven robust output regulation problem for linear parabolic systems is presented. Both the system as well as the ODE, i.e., the disturbance model, describing the disturbances are unknown, but finite-time sequential data obtained from measurements of the output to be controlled and additional boundary outputs are available. The data-driven controller is designed in the Koopman operator framework for PDEs, where the Koopman modes and eigenvalues are obtained from data using Hankel-DMD. It is shown that all system parameters and the eigenvalues of the disturbance model can be recovered from the available measurements by solving an inverse Sturm-Liouville problem. This allows to directly apply backstepping methods for the robust regulator design. For this, closed-loop stability in the presence of small errors in the Hankel-DMD is verified in the nominal case. Robust output regulation is shown for non-destabilizing model uncertainties. A numerical example demonstrates the results of the paper.</description>

      <title>The Economic Dispatch of Power-to-Gas Systems with Deep Reinforcement Learning:Tackling the Challenge of Delayed Rewards with Long-Term Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids. However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation. Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts, implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G technologies.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Debate-Based Large Language Model (LLM) for Complex Task Planning of 6G Network Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G networks have become increasingly complicated due to novel network architecture and newly emerging signal processing and transmission techniques, leading to significant burdens to 6G network management. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been considered a promising technique to equip 6G networks with AI-native intelligence. Different from most existing studies that only consider a single LLM, this work involves a multi-LLM debate-based scheme for 6G network management, where multiple LLMs can collaboratively improve the initial solution sequentially. Considering the complex nature of 6G domain, we propose a novel hierarchical debate scheme: LLMs will first debate the sub-task decomposition, and then debate each subtask step-by-step. Such a hierarchical approach can significantly reduce the overall debate difficulty by sub-task decomposition, aligning well with the complex nature of 6G networks and ensuring the final solution qualities. In addition, to better evaluate the proposed technique, we have defined a novel dataset named 6GPlan, including 110 complex 6G network management tasks and 5000 keyword solutions. Finally, the experiments show that the proposed hierarchical debate can significantly improve performance compared to baseline techniques, e.g. more than 30% coverage rate and global recall rate improvement.</description>

      <title>Learning Neural Controllers with Optimality and Stability Guarantees Using Input-Output Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant potential for addressing complex nonlinear control problems. For real-world safety-critical tasks, however, it is crucial to provide formal stability guarantees for the designed controllers. In this paper, we propose a new framework for designing neural controllers that achieve both stability and optimality with respect to certain functions. Our key idea is to exploit the concept of input-output dissipativity of nonlinear systems by learning neural storage functions and supply rate functions. As a generalization of Lyapunov theory, dissipativity theory provides a natural connection to optimal control theory, offering both stability guarantees and meaningful optimality certificates. The neural controllers can be directly derived from the learned supply rate functions and guarantee closed-loop stability while inheriting optimality properties that can be shaped towards user-defined control objectives. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Undergrounding Decisions for Wildfire Ignition Risk Mitigation across Multiple Hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With electric power infrastructure increasingly susceptible to impacts from climate-driven natural disasters, there is an increasing need for optimization algorithms that determine where to harden the power grid. Prior work has primarily developed optimal hardening approaches for specific acute disaster scenarios. Given the extensive costs of hardening the grid, it is important to understand how a particular set of resilience investments will perform under multiple types of natural hazards. Using a large-scale test case representing the Texas power system, this paper aims to understand how line undergrounding investment decisions made for wildfire ignition risk mitigation perform during a range of wildfire, hurricane, and wind events. Given the varying geographical spread and damage profile of these events, we show that investment decisions made to address one type of natural disaster do not necessarily improve broader resilience outcomes, supporting the need for co-optimization across a range of hazards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolving fuzzy systems build and adapt fuzzy models - such as predictors and controllers - by incrementally updating their rule-base structure from data streams. On the occasion of the 60-year anniversary of fuzzy set theory, commemorated during the Fuzz-IEEE 2025 event, this brief paper revisits the historical development and core contributions of classical fuzzy and adaptive modeling and control frameworks. It then highlights the emergence and significance of evolving intelligent systems in fuzzy modeling and control, emphasizing their advantages in handling nonstationary environments. Key challenges and future directions are discussed, including safety, interpretability, and principled structural evolution.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Analytical Models of Frequency and Voltage in Low-Inertia Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, low-order models of the frequency and voltage response of mixed-generation, low-inertia systems are presented. These models are unique in their ability to efficiently and accurately model frequency and voltage dynamics without increasing the computational burden as the share of inverters is increased in a system. The models are validated against industry-grade electromagnetic transient simulation, compared to which the proposed models are several orders of magnitude faster. The accuracy and efficiency of the low-inertia frequency and voltage models makes them well suited for a variety of planning and operational studies, especially for multi-scenario and probabilistic studies, as well as for screening studies to establish impact zones based on the dynamic interactions between inverters and synchronous generators.</description>

      <title>Controlled Reach-avoid Set Computation for Discrete-time Polynomial Systems via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the computation of controlled reach-avoid sets (CRASs) for discrete-time polynomial systems subject to control inputs. A CRAS is a set encompassing initial states from which there exist control inputs driving the system into a target set while avoiding unsafe sets. However, efficiently computing CRASs remains an open problem, especially for discrete-time systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for computing CRASs which takes advantage of a probabilistic perspective. This framework transforms the fundamentally nonlinear problem of computing CRASs into a computationally tractable convex optimization problem. By regarding control inputs as disturbances obeying certain probability distributions, a CRAS can be equivalently treated as a 0-reach-avoid set in the probabilistic sense, which consists of initial states from which the probability of eventually entering the target set while remaining within the safe set is greater than zero. Thus, we can employ the convex optimization method of computing 0-reach-avoid sets to estimate CRASs. Furthermore, inspired by the $\epsilon$-greedy strategy widely used in reinforcement learning, we propose an approach that iteratively updates the aforementioned probability distributions imposed on control inputs to compute larger CRASs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on extensive examples.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Battery and Line Undergrounding Investments for Transmission Systems under Wildfire Risk Scenarios: A Benders Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With electric power infrastructure posing an increasing risk of igniting wildfires under continuing climate change, utilities are frequently de-energizing power lines to mitigate wildfire ignition risk, which can cause load shedding. Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage systems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load shedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit substantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple possible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for optimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of uncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire ignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of scenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well as the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we decompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition approach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes of batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage consists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line undergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on a large-scale transmission network with real world data on wildfire ignition risks, load, and renewable generation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Event-triggered Formation Control of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents adaptive event-triggered formation control strategies for autonomous vehicles (AVs) subject to longitudinal and lateral motion uncertainties. The proposed framework explores various vehicular formations to enable safe and efficient navigation in complex traffic scenarios, such as narrow passages, collaborative obstacle avoidance, and adaptation to cut-in maneuvers. In contrast to conventional platoon control strategies that rely on predefined communication topologies and continuous state transmission, our approach employs a sampling-based observer to reconstruct vehicle dynamics. Building upon an adaptive backstepping continuous-time controller, we design three distinct event-triggered mechanisms, each offering a different trade-off between formation tracking performance and control efficiency by reducing the frequency of control signal updates. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is conducted to guarantee bounded tracking errors and to avoid Zeno behavior. Finally, the proposed event-triggered controllers are validated through simulations of vehicular formation in three scenarios, highlighting their impact on traffic safety and mobility.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning-based joint real-time energy scheduling for green buildings with heterogeneous battery energy storage devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green buildings (GBs) with renewable energy and building energy management systems (BEMS) enable efficient energy use and support sustainable development. Electric vehicles (EVs), as flexible storage resources, enhance system flexibility when integrated with stationary energy storage systems (ESS) for real-time scheduling. However, differing degradation and operational characteristics of ESS and EVs complicate scheduling strategies. This paper proposes a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for joint real-time scheduling based on a combined battery system (CBS) integrating ESS and EVs. We develop accurate degradation models and cost estimates, prioritize EV travel demands, and enable collaborative ESS-EV operation under varying conditions. A prediction model optimizes energy interaction between CBS and BEMS. To address heterogeneous states, action coupling, and learning efficiency, the DRL algorithm incorporates double networks, a dueling mechanism, and prioritized experience replay. Experiments show a 37.94 percent to 40.01 percent reduction in operating costs compared to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Data-Driven Model-Free Safety-Critical Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for enabling safe velocity control of general robotic systems using data-driven model-free Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Model-free CBFs rely on an exponentially stable velocity controller and a design parameter (e.g. alpha in CBFs); this design parameter depends on the exponential decay rate of the controller. However, in practice, the decay rate is often unavailable, making it non-trivial to use model-free CBFs, as it requires manual tuning for alpha. To address this, a Neural Network is used to learn the Lyapunov function from data, and the maximum decay rate of the systems built-in velocity controller is subsequently estimated. Furthermore, to integrate the estimated decay rate with model-free CBFs, we derive a probabilistic safety condition that incorporates a confidence bound on the violation rate of the exponential stability condition, using Chernoff bound. This enhances robustness against uncertainties in stability violations. The proposed framework has been tested on a UR5e robot in multiple experimental settings, and its effectiveness in ensuring safe velocity control with model-free CBFs has been demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Attitude Estimation Using Scalar Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the problem of orientation estimation for rigid bodies through a novel framework based on scalar measurements. Unlike traditional vector-based methods, the proposed approach enables selective utilization of only the reliable axes of vector measurements while seamlessly incorporating alternative scalar modalities such as Pitot tubes, barometers with range sensors, and landmark-based constraints. The estimation problem is reformulated within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework, allowing the application of a deterministic linear Kalman filter. This design guarantees Global Uniform Exponential Stability (GES) under the Uniform Observability (UO) condition. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving robust and accurate attitude estimation, even with partial vector measurements that simulate sensor axis failure.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization of Data-Assisted Control in port-Hamiltonian Systems (DAC-pH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothetical hybrid control framework for port-Hamiltonian (p$\mathcal{H}$) systems, employing a dynamic decomposition based on Data-Assisted Control (DAC). The system's evolution is split into two parts with fixed topology: Right-Hand Side (RHS)- an intrinsic Hamiltonian flow handling worst-case parametric uncertainties, and Left-Hand Side (LHS)- a dissipative/input flow addressing both structural and parametric uncertainties. A virtual port variable $\Pi$ serves as the interface between these two components. A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow, determining a desired port control value $\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for providing optimal policy in mapping $\Pi_c$ to the actual system input. This hybrid approach effectively manages RHS uncertainties while preserving the system's inherent structure. Key advantages include adjustable performance via LHS controller parameters, enhanced AI explainability and interpretability through the port variable $\Pi$, the ability to guarantee safety and state attainability with hard/soft constraints, reduced complexity in learning hypothesis classes compared to end-to-end solutions, and improved state/parameter estimation using LHS prior knowledge and system Hamiltonian to address partial observability. The paper details the p$\mathcal{H}$ formulation, derives the decomposition, and presents the modular controller architecture. Beyond design, crucial aspects of stability and robustness analysis and synthesis are investigated, paving the way for deeper theoretical investigations. An application example, a pendulum with nonlinear dynamics, is simulated to demonstrate the approach's empirical and phenomenological benefits for future research.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization with Amplified Privacy via Efficient Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized optimization is crucial for multi-agent systems, with significant concerns about communication efficiency and privacy. This paper explores the role of efficient communication in decentralized stochastic gradient descent algorithms for enhancing privacy preservation. We develop a novel algorithm that incorporates two key features: random agent activation and sparsified communication. Utilizing differential privacy, we demonstrate that these features reduce noise without sacrificing privacy, thereby amplifying the privacy guarantee and improving accuracy. Additionally, we analyze the convergence and the privacy-accuracy-communication trade-off of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we present experimental results to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of contemporary materials testing, the demand for scalability, adaptability, parallelism, and speed has surged due to the proliferation of diverse materials and testing standards. Traditional controller-based systems often fall short in meeting these requirements, resulting in adaptability and processing speed limitations. Conversely, FPGA-based controllers present a multifaceted, high-performance solution. Key advantages of FPGA-based controllers in materials testing encompass reconfiguration capabilities for cost-effective adaptation to evolving materials and standards. FPGAs also enable the integration of parallel control and data acquisition circuits, vital for multichannel test equipment demanding simultaneous, independent operation of multiple control channels.</description>

      <title>Distributed Risk-Sensitive Safety Filters for Uncertain Discrete-Time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge, particularly in settings where centralized coordination is impractical. In this work, we propose a novel risk-sensitive safety filter for discrete-time multi-agent systems with uncertain dynamics that leverages control barrier functions (CBFs) defined through value functions. Our approach relies on centralized risk-sensitive safety conditions based on exponential risk operators to ensure robustness against model uncertainties. We introduce a distributed formulation of the safety filter by deriving two alternative strategies: one based on worst-case anticipation and another on proximity to a known safe policy. By allowing agents to switch between strategies, feasibility can be ensured. Through detailed numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in maintaining safety without being overly conservative.</description>

      <title>Extended Version of "Distributed Adaptive Resilient Consensus Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Multiagent Systems Against Deception Attacks"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed resilient consensus problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems susceptible to deception attacks. The attacks invade both sensor and actuator channels of each agent. A specific class of Nussbaum functions is adopted to manage the attack-incurred multiple unknown control directions. Additionally, a general form of these Nussbaum functions is provided, which helps to ease the degeneration of output performance caused by Nussbaum gains. Then, by introducing finite-time distributed reference systems and local-error-based dynamic gains, we propose a novel distributed adaptive backstepping-based resilient consensus control strategy. We prove that all the closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded under attacks, and output consensus errors converge in finite time to a clearly-defined residual set whose size can be reduced by tuning control parameters, which is superior to existing results. Simulation results display the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-random sequences for low-cost operando impedance measurements of Li-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operando impedance measurements are promising for monitoring batteries in the field. In this work, we present pseudo-random sequences for low-cost operando battery impedance measurements. The quadratic-residue ternary sequence and direct-synthesis ternary sequence exhibit specific properties related to eigenvectors of the discrete Fourier transform matrix that allow computationally efficient compensation for drifts and transients in operando impedance measurements. We describe the application of pseudo-random sequences and provide the data processing required to suppress drift and transients, validated on simulations. Finally, we perform experimental operando impedance measurements on a Li-ion battery cell during fast-charging, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method. It's low-cost hardware requirements, fast measurements, and simple data-processing make the method practical for embedding in battery management systems.</description>

      <title>A 40.68-MHz, 200-ns-Settling Active Rectifier and TX-Side Load Monitoring for Minimizing Radiated Power in Biomedical Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter describes a 40.68 MHz wireless power transfer receiver for implantable applications focused on minimizing tissue heating. The system features a novel power radiated efficiency optimization strategy and a fast-settling active rectifier that maintains high efficiency during load and link variations required for downlink communication. The power radiated efficiency optimization explicitly reduces tissue heating while enabling transmitter-side load monitoring for closed-loop control. The active rectifier was fabricated in 40nm CMOS and achieves a voltage conversion ratio of 93.9% and a simulated power conversion efficiency of 90.1% in a 0.19 $mm^2$ area, resulting in a 118 mW/$mm^2$ power density while integrating the resonance and filter capacitors. The worst-case settling of the on- and off-delay compensation in the active rectifier is 200 ns, which is the fastest reported to date.</description>

      <title>Deep Equivariant Multi-Agent Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With multi-agent systems increasingly deployed autonomously at scale in complex environments, ensuring safety of the data-driven policies is critical. Control Barrier Functions have emerged as an effective tool for enforcing safety constraints, yet existing learning-based methods often lack in scalability, generalization and sampling efficiency as they overlook inherent geometric structures of the system. To address this gap, we introduce symmetries-infused distributed Control Barrier Functions, enforcing the satisfaction of intrinsic symmetries on learnable graph-based safety certificates. We theoretically motivate the need for equivariant parametrization of CBFs and policies, and propose a simple, yet efficient and adaptable methodology for constructing such equivariant group-modular networks via the compatible group actions. This approach encodes safety constraints in a distributed data-efficient manner, enabling zero-shot generalization to larger and denser swarms. Through extensive simulations on multi-robot navigation tasks, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of safety, scalability, and task success rates, highlighting the importance of embedding symmetries in safe distributed neural policies.</description>

      <title>A distributed motion planning approach to cooperative underwater acoustic source tracking and pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of underwater acoustic source tracking and pursuit with a team of autonomous underwater vehicles. Producing distributed control strategies in an underwater sensor network is not trivial since communication is primarily acoustic, which makes it intermittent and often plagued with major difficulties. For this reason, we propose an optimization scheme based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process for improving the performance of underwater mobile sensor networks, in which autonomous underwater vehicles (agents) play the role of moving nodes of a network. The key idea is to adjust the agents' guidance strategies to achieve coordinated motion planning, enabling optimal geometric configurations between the agents and the target to enhance tracking performance. Such a problem is cast as a multi-objective optimization problem that is solved through a receding horizon lookahead optimization scheme since we are interested in long-term tracking accuracy. The planning strategy is distributed using the sequential multi-agent decision-making paradigm to make the solving tractable since the optimization depends on the joint action domain. A distributed control framework has been implemented in a simulation environment to validate the proposed approach, which explicitly accounts for the major limitations imposed by acoustic communications.</description>

      <title>On the Interplay of Privacy, Persuasion and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a communication-theoretic framework for privacy-aware and resilient decision making in cyber-physical systems under misaligned objectives between the encoder and the decoder. The encoder observes two correlated signals ($X$,$\theta$) and transmits a finite-rate message $Z$ to aid a legitimate controller (the decoder) in estimating $X+\theta$, while an eavesdropper intercepts $Z$ to infer the private parameter $\theta$. Unlike conventional setups where encoder and decoder share a common MSE objective, here the encoder minimizes a Lagrangian that balances legitimate control fidelity and the privacy leakage about $\theta$. In contrast, the decoder's goal is purely to minimize its own estimation error without regard for privacy. We analyze fully, partially, and non-revealing strategies that arise from this conflict, and characterize optimal linear encoders when the rate constraints are lifted. For finite-rate channels, we employ gradient-based methods to compute the optimal controllers. Numerical experiments illustrate how tuning the privacy parameter shapes the trade-off between control performance and resilience against unauthorized inferences.</description>

      <title>Composite Reward Design in PPO-Driven Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-free and reinforcement learning-based adaptive filtering methods are gaining traction for denoising in dynamic, non-stationary environments such as wireless signal channels. Traditional filters like LMS, RLS, Wiener, and Kalman are limited by assumptions of stationary or requiring complex fine-tuning or exact noise statistics or fixed models. This letter proposes an adaptive filtering framework using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a composite reward that balances SNR improvement, MSE reduction, and residual smoothness. Experiments on synthetic signals with various noise types show that our PPO agent generalizes beyond its training distribution, achieving real-time performance and outperforming classical filters. This work demonstrates the viability of policy-gradient reinforcement learning for robust, low-latency adaptive signal filtering.</description>

      <title>Towards Infant Sleep-Optimized Driving: Synergizing Wearable and Vehicle Sensing in Intelligent Cruise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated driving (AD) has substantially improved vehicle safety and driving comfort, but their impact on passenger well-being, particularly infant sleep, is not sufficiently studied. Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp maneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and parental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving behavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In particular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to varying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively synergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer-based neural networks are integrated with RL to model the relationship between driving behavior and infant sleep quality under diverse traffic and road conditions. Based on the sleep quality indicators from the wearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data from map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving aggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control strategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and overtaking. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly improves infant sleep quality compared to baseline methods, while preserving desirable travel efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a groundbreaking technology for 6G wireless communication networks, enabling cost-effective control over wireless propagation environment. By dynamically manipulating its codebook so as to deflect the direction of the reflected electromagnetic wave, RIS can achieve enhanced signal quality, extended coverage, and interference mitigation. This study presents experimental performance of ZTE Dynamic 2.0 RIS products through a series of real-world tests conducted on Turkcell's millimeter-wave (mmWave) testbed. The evaluation involves network coverage extension in urban areas, multi-user efficiency, and the integration of virtual reality technology to support immersive applications in next-generation 6G networks. Through a comprehensive measurement-based analysis, the performance of the RIS product is demonstrated, highlighting its potential to address critical challenges in mmWave communications and to enable advanced 6G use cases.</description>

      <title>RIS Size Determination Across Frequencies and Deployment Scenarios: A Simulation-Based Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in the integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) into next-generation wireless communications systems, a critical gap remains in understanding what the dimensions of an RIS must be to provide meaningful performance gains across realistic deployment scenarios. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a practical and scenario-aware methodology for determining optimal RIS dimensions, tailored to specific frequency bands, environments, and use cases. Leveraging a realistic simulation model that incorporates angular scattering characteristics, practical network node locations, and propagation constraints, we evaluate the RIS-assisted performance in a diverse set of configurations. For selected use-cases, we quantify key performance indicators such as average signal-to-noise ratio and outage probability, and we demonstrate how RIS size impacts system reliability. Our findings show that RIS deployment effectiveness is highly sensitive to both physical size and geometric placement, and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The proposed framework, supported by detailed use case tables and validated through comprehensive simulations, offers design guidelines for operators and vendors seeking to deploy RIS in practical wireless network settings.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical and Collaborative LLM-Based Control for Multi-UAV Motion and Communication in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate, and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow. Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components. Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research opportunities for prospective researchers.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the development of an autonomous car by the UruBots team for the 2025 FIRA Autonomous Cars Challenge (Pro). The project involves constructing a compact electric vehicle, approximately the size of an RC car, capable of autonomous navigation through different tracks. The design incorporates mechanical and electronic components and machine learning algorithms that enable the vehicle to make real-time navigation decisions based on visual input from a camera. We use deep learning models to process camera images and control vehicle movements. Using a dataset of over ten thousand images, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to drive the vehicle effectively, through two outputs, steering and throttle. The car completed the track in under 30 seconds, achieving a pace of approximately 0.4 meters per second while avoiding obstacles.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization on Compact Submanifolds by Quantized Riemannian Gradient Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized optimization on compact submanifolds, where a finite sum of smooth (possibly non-convex) local functions is minimized by $n$ agents forming an undirected and connected graph. However, the efficiency of distributed optimization is often hindered by communication bottlenecks. To mitigate this, we propose the Quantized Riemannian Gradient Tracking (Q-RGT) algorithm, where agents update their local variables using quantized gradients. The introduction of quantization noise allows our algorithm to bypass the constraints of the accurate Riemannian projection operator (such as retraction), further improving iterative efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence rate in the presence of quantization, matching the convergence rate of methods without quantization. Additionally, we explicitly derive lower bounds on decentralized consensus associated with a function of quantization levels. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Q-RGT performs comparably to non-quantized methods while reducing communication bottlenecks and computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Fractional Collisions: A Framework for Risk Estimation of Counterfactual Conflicts using Autonomous Driving Behavior Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for estimating collision risk from counterfactual simulated scenarios built on sensor data from automated driving systems (ADS) or naturalistic driving databases. Two-agent conflicts are assessed by detecting and classifying conflict type, identifying the agents' roles (initiator or responder), identifying the point of reaction of the responder, and modeling their human behavioral expectations as probabilistic counterfactual trajectories. The states are used to compute velocity differentials at collision, which when combined with crash models, estimates severity of loss in terms of probabilistic injury or property damage, henceforth called fractional collisions. The probabilistic models may also be extended to include other uncertainties associated with the simulation, features, and agents. We verify the effectiveness of the methodology in a synthetic simulation environment using reconstructed trajectories from 300+ collision and near-collision scenes sourced from VTTI's SHRP2 database and Nexar dashboard camera data. Our methodology predicted fractional collisions within 1% of ground truth collisions. We then evaluate agent-initiated collision risk of an arbitrary ADS software release by replacing the naturalistic responder in these synthetic reconstructions with an ADS simulator and comparing the outcome to human-response outcomes. Our ADS reduced naturalistic collisions by 4x and fractional collision risk by ~62%. The framework's utility is also demonstrated on 250k miles of proprietary, open-loop sensor data collected on ADS test vehicles, re-simulated with an arbitrary ADS software release. The ADS initiated conflicts that caused 0.4 injury-causing and 1.7 property-damaging fractional collisions, and the ADS improved collision risk in 96% of the agent-initiated conflicts.</description>

      <title>Delay Optimization in Remote ID-Based UAV Communication via BLE and Wi-Fi Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remote identification (Remote ID) broadcast capability allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to exchange messages, which is a pivotal technology for inter-UAV communications. Although this capability enhances the operational visibility, low delay in Remote ID-based communications is critical for ensuring the efficiency and timeliness of multi-UAV operations in dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we first establish delay models for Remote ID communications by considering packet reception and collisions across both BLE 4 and Wi-Fi protocols. Building upon these models, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the long-term communication delay through adaptive protocol selection. Since the delay performance varies with the UAV density, we propose an adaptive BLE/Wi-Fi switching algorithm based on the multi-agent deep Q-network approach. Experimental results demonstrate that in dynamic-density scenarios, our strategy achieves 32.1% and 37.7% lower latency compared to static BLE 4 and Wi-Fi modes respectively.</description>

      <title>Versatile Loco-Manipulation through Flexible Interlimb Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to flexibly leverage limbs for loco-manipulation is essential for enabling autonomous robots to operate in unstructured environments. Yet, prior work on loco-manipulation is often constrained to specific tasks or predetermined limb configurations. In this work, we present Reinforcement Learning for Interlimb Coordination (ReLIC), an approach that enables versatile loco-manipulation through flexible interlimb coordination. The key to our approach is an adaptive controller that seamlessly bridges the execution of manipulation motions and the generation of stable gaits based on task demands. Through the interplay between two controller modules, ReLIC dynamically assigns each limb for manipulation or locomotion and robustly coordinates them to achieve the task success. Using efficient reinforcement learning in simulation, ReLIC learns to perform stable gaits in accordance with the manipulation goals in the real world. To solve diverse and complex tasks, we further propose to interface the learned controller with different types of task specifications, including target trajectories, contact points, and natural language instructions. Evaluated on 12 real-world tasks that require diverse and complex coordination patterns, ReLIC demonstrates its versatility and robustness by achieving a success rate of 78.9% on average.

      <title>LUCIFER: Language Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration. We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat, goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge for operational success.</description>

      <title>A Generative Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning-Based Approach for Construction of Representative Drive Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate driving cycle construction is crucial for vehicle design, fuel economy analysis, and environmental impact assessments. A generative Physics-Informed Expected SARSA-Monte Carlo (PIESMC) approach that constructs representative driving cycles by capturing transient dynamics, acceleration, deceleration, idling, and road grade transitions while ensuring model fidelity is introduced. Leveraging a physics-informed reinforcement learning framework with Monte Carlo sampling, PIESMC delivers efficient cycle construction with reduced computational cost. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate that PIESMC replicates key kinematic and energy metrics, achieving up to a 57.3% reduction in cumulative kinematic fragment errors compared to the Micro-trip-based (MTB) method and a 10.5% reduction relative to the Markov-chain-based (MCB) method. Moreover, it is nearly an order of magnitude faster than conventional techniques. Analyses of vehicle-specific power distributions and wavelet-transformed frequency content further confirm its ability to reproduce experimental central tendencies and variability.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Learning of Multirotor Controller Gains: A Data-Driven Approach with Experimental Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the single-shot learning capabilities of retrospective cost optimization based data-driven control applied to learning multirotor controller gains for trajectory tracking. In particular, the proposed control approach is first used within a simple multirotor simulation environment to learn appropriate multirotor controller gains to follow a trajectory. Then, the gains resulting from a single simulation run are used in a more complex multirotor simulation environment based on Simulink for performance verification. Finally, the resulting gains are implemented in a physical quadrotor and the results for waypoint and trajectory tracking are reported in this paper. The proposed control approach is the continuous-time version of the widely used discrete-time retrospective control adaptive control algorithm, which is simpler to implement within continuous-time simulation environments and whose performance does not depend on appropriate sampling time choice.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Beta HMM: Hidden Markov Model Filtering with Equal Exit Probabilities and a Step-Size Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hidden Markov model (HMM) provides a powerful framework for inference in time-varying environments, where the underlying state evolves according to a Markov chain. To address the optimal filtering problem in general dynamic settings, we propose the $\alpha\beta$-HMM algorithm, which simplifies the state transition model to a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities and introduces a step-size parameter to balance the influence of observational data and the model. By analyzing the algorithm's dynamics in stationary environments, we uncover a fundamental trade-off between inference accuracy and adaptation capability, highlighting how key parameters and observation quality impact performance. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of the nonlinear dynamical system governing the evolution of the log-belief ratio, along with supporting numerical experiments, demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively balances adaptability and inference performance in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Augmented Physics-Based Model for Estimation and Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-space estimation and tracking rely on accurate dynamical models to perform well. However, obtaining an vaccurate dynamical model for complex scenarios or adapting to changes in the system poses challenges to the estimation process. Recently, augmented physics-based models (APBMs) appear as an appealing strategy to cope with these challenges where the composition of a small and adaptive neural network with known physics-based models (PBM) is learned on the fly following an augmented state-space estimation approach. A major issue when introducing data-driven components in such a scenario is the danger of compromising the meaning (or interpretability) of estimated states. In this work, we propose a novel constrained estimation strategy that constrains the APBM dynamics close to the PBM. The novel state-space constrained approach leads to more flexible ways to impose constraints than the traditional APBM approach. Our experiments with a radar-tracking scenario demonstrate different aspects of the proposed approach and the trade-offs inherent in the imposed constraints.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-MIX: Enhancing Sample Efficiency in Multi-Agent RL Using Ensemble Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on a range of multi-agent tasks. Yet, MARL algorithms typically require significantly more environment interactions than their single-agent counterparts to converge, a problem exacerbated by the difficulty in exploring over a large joint action space and the high variance intrinsic to MARL environments. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel algorithm that combines a decomposed centralized critic with decentralized ensemble learning, incorporating several key contributions. The main component in our scheme is a selective exploration method that leverages ensemble kurtosis. We extend the global decomposed critic with a diversity-regularized ensemble of individual critics and utilize its excess kurtosis to guide exploration toward high-uncertainty states and actions. To improve sample efficiency, we train the centralized critic with a novel truncated variation of the TD($\lambda$) algorithm, enabling efficient off-policy learning with reduced variance. On the actor side, our suggested algorithm adapts the mixed samples approach to MARL, mixing on-policy and off-policy loss functions for training the actors. This approach balances between stability and efficiency and outperforms purely off-policy learning. The evaluation shows our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on standard MARL benchmarks, including a variety of SMAC II maps.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Bidirectional Inverter Equivalent Circuit Model for Distribution Grid Steady-State Analysis and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a \textit{physics-based} steady-state equivalent circuit model of a two-stage bidirectional inverter. These inverters connect distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems, to distribution grids. Existing inverter models have technical gaps on three fronts: i) inadequate modeling of inverter losses, ii) use of mathematical abstractions for bidirectional flow of power, and iii) inability to integrate different control modes into nonlinear solvers without loss of generality. We propose a physics-first model that explicitly captures losses in passive circuit components based on circuit-level principles. We enable bidirectional power flow without binary or complementarity constraints by formulating loss terms as smooth, sign-aware expressions of current. We introduce and parameterize controlled current sources with twice-differentiable continuous functions to enable inverter control modes without loss of generality. We integrate DERs with the proposed inverter model at the load buses of distribution networks to perform power flow and optimization studies on real-world distribution networks with over 20,000 nodes. We demonstrate that the proposed model is more accurate, integrates seamlessly with various control modes without loss of generality, and scales robustly to large optimization problems.

      <title>Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Controlling Unknown Linear Diffusion Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear diffusion processes serve as canonical continuous-time models for dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. These systems evolve according to drift matrices that specify the instantaneous rates of change in the expected system state, while also experiencing continuous random disturbances modeled by Brownian noise. For instance, in medical applications such as artificial pancreas systems, the drift matrices represent the internal dynamics of glucose concentrations. Classical results in stochastic control provide optimal policies under perfect knowledge of the drift matrices. However, practical decision-making scenarios typically feature uncertainty about the drift; in medical contexts, such parameters are patient-specific and unknown, requiring adaptive policies for efficiently learning the drift matrices while ensuring system stability and optimal performance.
  We study the Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm for decision-making in linear diffusion processes with unknown drift matrices. For this algorithm that designs control policies as if samples from a posterior belief about the parameters fully coincide with the unknown truth, we establish efficiency. That is, Thompson sampling learns optimal control actions fast, incurring only a square-root of time regret, and also learns to stabilize the system in a short time period. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for TS in a diffusion process control problem. Moreover, our empirical simulations in three settings that involve blood-glucose and flight control demonstrate that TS significantly improves regret, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, suggesting it explores in a more guarded fashion. Our theoretical analysis includes characterization of a certain optimality manifold that relates the geometry of the drift matrices to the optimal control of the diffusion process, among others.</description>

Abstract: We study online control for continuous-time linear systems with finite sampling rates, where the objective is to design an online procedure that learns under non-stochastic noise and performs comparably to a fixed optimal linear controller. We present a novel two-level online algorithm, by integrating a higher-level learning strategy and a lower-level feedback control strategy. This method offers a practical and robust solution for online control, which achieves sublinear regret. Our work provides the first nonasymptotic results for controlling continuous-time linear systems with finite number of interactions with the system. Moreover, we examine how to train an agent in domain randomization environments from a non-stochastic control perspective. By applying our method to the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm, we achieved improved results in multiple reinforcement learning tasks within domain randomization environments. Our work provides new insights into non-asymptotic analyses of controlling continuous-time systems.

      <title>Modeling, control, and stiffness regulation of layer jamming-based continuum robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuum robots with variable compliance have gained significant attention due to their adaptability in unstructured environments. Among various stiffness modulation techniques, layer jamming (LJ) provides a simple yet effective approach for achieving tunable stiffness. However, most existing LJ-based continuum robot models rely on static or quasi-static approximations, lacking a rigorous control-oriented dynamical formulation. Consequently, they are unsuitable for real-time control tasks requiring simultaneous regulation of configuration and stiffness and fail to capture the full dynamic behavior of LJ-based continuum robots. To address this gap, this paper proposes a port-Hamiltonian formulation for LJ-based continuum robots, formally characterizing the two key phenomena -- shape locking and tunable stiffness -- within a unified energy-based framework. Based on this model, we develop a passivity-based control approach that enables decoupled regulation of stiffness and configuration with provable stability guarantees. We validate the proposed framework through comprehensive experiments on the OctRobot-I continuum robotic platform. The results demonstrate consistency between theoretical predictions and empirical data, highlighting the feasibility of our approach for real-world implementation.</description>

      <title>Conformal Wide-Angle Scanning Leaky-Wave Antenna for V-Band On-Body Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable on-body millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars can provide obstacle detection and guidance for visually impaired individuals. The antennas, being a crucial component of these systems, must be lightweight, flexible, low-cost, and compact. However, existing antennas suffer from a rigid form factor and limited reconfigurability. This article presents a low-profile, fast scanning leaky-wave antenna (LWA) operating in the unlicensed V-band (57-64 GHz) for on-body applications such as lightweight portable frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. The novel meandering microstrip design allows independent control of gain and scanning rate (rate of change of main beam pointing direction with frequency). Experimental results show that the LWA achieves a realized gain above 10 dB with a fan-beam steering range in the H-plane from -35{deg} to 45{deg} over the operating frequency band, while the half power beamwidth (HPBW) is within 20{deg} in planar condition. To assess the on-body applicability, the antenna's performance is evaluated under bending. When placed on the knee (corresponding to 80 mm radius), the beam steers from -25{deg} to 55{deg} with a maximum realized gain degradation of 1.75 dB, and an increase of HPBW up to 25{deg}. This demonstrates the LWA's robustness in conformal conditions, while maintaining beam-forming and beam-scanning capabilities. Simulations confirm that the LWA's ground plane minimizes user exposure, adhering to international guidelines. Finally, we demonstrate a 2-D spatial scanning by employing an array of twelve LWAs with phased excitation, enabling beam-forming in the E-plane from -50{deg} to 50{deg}, while the HPBW remains below 20{deg}. Mutual coupling analysis reveals that isolation loss and active reflection coefficient remain below 15 dB throughout the operating band.</description>

      <title>ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.</description>

      <title>LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas and Ad-Hoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.</description>

      <title>Extending Internet Access Over LoRa for Internet of Things and Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LoRa bridges the gap between remote locations and mainstream networks, enabling large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. Despite the recent advancements around LoRa, Internet access over this technology is still largely unexplored. Most existing solutions only handle packets within the local LoRa network and do not interact with web applications. This limits the scalability and the ability to deliver essential web services in disconnected regions. This work proposes and implements ILoRa to extend the public Internet to disconnected areas for essential service delivery. ILoRa enables accessing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web pages on the Internet over a LoRa backbone network. It comprises a ILoRa coordinator code (ICN) and access point nodes (APNs). The ICN interfaces the LoRa network with the public Internet and interprets content. The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which devices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data handling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation validates the proposed system. The implementation achieves a throughput of 1.06 kbps tested for an Internet-based API returning JSON data of 930 B. Furthermore, the APN consumed approximately $0.162$A current, and the resource utilization on the ICN was minimal.</description>

      <title>Implementing LoRa MIMO System for Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bandwidth constraints limit LoRa implementations. Contemporary IoT applications require higher throughput than that provided by LoRa. This work introduces a LoRa Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system and a spatial multiplexing algorithm to address LoRa's bandwidth limitation. The transceivers in the proposed approach modulate the signals on distinct frequencies of the same LoRa band. A Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) method is used at the transmitters to provide a wider MIMO channel. Unlike conventional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques, this work exploits the orthogonality of the LoRa signals facilitated by its proprietary Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation to perform an OFDM in the proposed LoRa MIMO system. By varying the Spreading Factor (SF) and bandwidth of LoRa signals, orthogonal signals can transmit on the same frequency irrespective of the FDM. Even though the channel correlation is minimal for different spreading factors and bandwidths, different Carrier Frequencies (CF) ensure the signals do not overlap and provide additional degrees of freedom. This work assesses the proposed model's performance and conducts an extensive analysis to provide an overview of resources consumed by the proposed system. Finally, this work provides the detailed results of a thorough evaluation of the model on test hardware.</description>

      <title>A Cloud-native Agile approach to cyber platform prototyping and integration for astronomy: the ENGAGE SKA case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Observatory is gearing up the formal construction of its two radio interferometers in Australia and South Africa after the end of design and pre-construction phases. Agile methodologies, the Cloud native Computing technologies and the DevOps software ideas are influencing the design of compute infrastructures that will be key to reduce the operational costs of SKA while improving the control and monitoring of the SKA antennas and ancillary systems, Correlators, HPC facilities or related data centre tiered systems. These tools will likely include advanced power metering technologies and efficient distribution automation and Network Operation Centres (NOC). SKA will become the world's largest radio telescope and is expected to achieve its first science by 2026. To cope with this dimension and complexity, a key part of this distributed Observatory is the overall software control and monitoring system embodied in the Observatory Management and Control (OMC) and the Services Teams that requires specialized Agile Teams to assist in software and cyber infrastructure building using an Agile development environment that includes test automation, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Deployment. To manage such a large and distributed machine, the Agile approach was adopted for the core software package of the SKA Telescope aimed at scheduling observations, controlling their execution, monitoring the telescope status and ensuring scalability and reliability. Here, we report on the ENGAGE SKA ciberinfrastructure prototyping support to the SKA Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</description>

      <title>Space-O-RAN: Enabling Intelligent, Open, and Interoperable Non Terrestrial Networks in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite networks are rapidly evolving, yet most \glspl{ntn} remain isolated from terrestrial orchestration frameworks. Their control architectures are typically monolithic and static, limiting their adaptability to dynamic traffic, topology changes, and mission requirements. These constraints lead to inefficient spectrum use and underutilized network capacity. Although \gls{ai} promises automation, its deployment in orbit is limited by computing, energy, and connectivity limitations.
  This paper introduces Space-O-RAN, a distributed control architecture that extends Open RAN principles into satellite constellations through hierarchical, closed-loop control. Lightweight \glspl{dapp} operate onboard satellites, enabling real-time functions like scheduling and beam steering without relying on persistent ground access. Cluster-level coordination is managed via \glspl{spaceric}, which leverage low-latency \glspl{isl} for autonomous decisions in orbit. Strategic tasks, including AI training and policy updates, are transferred to terrestrial platforms \glspl{smo} using digital twins and feeder links.
  A key enabler is the dynamic mapping of the O-RAN interfaces to satellite links, supporting adaptive signaling under varying conditions. Simulations using the Starlink topology validate the latency bounds that inform this architectural split, demonstrating both feasibility and scalability for autonomous satellite RAN operations.</description>

      <title>Delayed-Decision Motion Planning in the Presence of Multiple Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable automated driving technology is challenged by various sources of uncertainties, in particular, behavioral uncertainties of traffic agents. It is common for traffic agents to have intentions that are unknown to others, leaving an automated driving car to reason over multiple possible behaviors. This paper formalizes a behavior planning scheme in the presence of multiple possible futures with corresponding probabilities. We present a maximum entropy formulation and show how, under certain assumptions, this allows delayed decision-making to improve safety. The general formulation is then turned into a model predictive control formulation, which is solved as a quadratic program or a set of quadratic programs. We discuss implementation details for improving computation and verify operation in simulation and on a mobile robot.</description>

      <title>Active inference as a unified model of collision avoidance behavior in human drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collision avoidance -- involving a rapid threat detection and quick execution of the appropriate evasive maneuver -- is a critical aspect of driving. However, existing models of human collision avoidance behavior are fragmented, focusing on specific scenarios or only describing certain aspects of the avoidance behavior, such as response times. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution. Our results highlight the potential of active inference as a unified framework for understanding and modeling human behavior in complex real-life driving tasks.</description>
