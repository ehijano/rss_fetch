      <title>Admissible Information Structures and the Non-Existence of Global Martingale Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: No-arbitrage asset pricing characterizes valuation through the existence of equivalent martingale measures relative to a filtration and a class of admissible trading strategies. In practice, pricing is performed across multiple asset classes driven by economic variables that are only partially spanned by traded instruments, raising a structural question: does there exist a single admissible information structure under which all traded assets can be jointly priced as martingales?. We treat the filtration as an endogenous object constrained by admissibility and time-ordering, rather than as an exogenous primitive. For any finite collection of assets, whenever martingale pricing is feasible under some admissible filtration, it is already feasible under a canonical minimal filtration generated by the asset prices themselves; these pricing-sufficient filtrations are unique up to null sets and stable under restriction and aggregation when a common pricing measure exists. Our main result shows that this local compatibility does not extend globally: with three independent unspanned finite-variation drivers, there need not exist any admissible filtration and equivalent measure under which all assets are jointly martingales. The obstruction is sharp (absent with one driver and compatible pairwise with two) and equivalent to failure of admissible dynamic completeness. We complement the theory with numerical diagnostics based on discrete-time Doob--Meyer decompositions, illustrating how admissible information structures suppress predictable components, while inadmissible filtrations generate systematic predictability.</description>

      <title>Optimal Underreporting and Competitive Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a dynamic insurance market model comprising two competing insurance companies and a continuum of insureds, and examines the interaction between strategic underreporting by the insureds and competitive pricing between the insurance companies under a Bonus-Malus System (BMS) framework. For the first time in an oligopolistic setting, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the insureds' optimal reporting barrier, as well as its continuous dependence on the BMS premiums. For the 2-class BMS case, we prove the existence of Nash equilibrium premium strategies and conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis on the impact of the model parameters on the equilibrium premiums.</description>

      <title>Leveraged positions on decentralized lending platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework to optimize leveraged staking ("loopy") strategies in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), in which a staked asset is supplied as collateral, the underlying is borrowed and re-staked, and the loop can be repeated across multiple lending markets. Exploiting the fact that DeFi borrow rates are deterministic functions of pool utilization, we reduce the multi-market problem to a convex allocation over market exposures and obtain closed-form solutions under three interest-rate models: linear, kinked, and adaptive (Morpho's AdaptiveCurveIRM). The framework incorporates market-specific leverage limits, utilization-dependent borrowing costs, and transaction fees. Backtests on the Ethereum and Base blockchains using the largest Morpho wstETH/WETH markets (from January 1 to April 1, 2025) show that rebalanced leveraged positions can reach up to 6.2% APY versus 3.1% for unleveraged staking, with strong dependence on position size and rebalancing frequency. Our results provide a mathematical basis for transparent, automated DeFi portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Log-optimality with small liability stream</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an incomplete financial market with general continuous semimartingale dynamics; we model an investor with log-utility preferences who, in addition to an initial capital, receives units of a non-traded endowment process. Using duality techniques, we derive the fourth-order expansion of the primal value function with respect to the units $\epsilon$, held in the non-traded endowment. In turn, this lays the foundation for expanding the optimal wealth process, in this context, up to second order w.r.t. $\epsilon$. The key processes underpinning the aforementioned results are given in terms of Kunita-Watanabe projections, mirroring the case of lower order expansions of similar nature. Both the case of finite and infinite horizons are treated in a unified manner.</description>

      <title>Market Making and Transient Impact in Spot FX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dealers in foreign exchange markets provide bid and ask prices to their clients at which they are happy to buy and sell, respectively. To manage risk, dealers can skew their quotes and hedge in the interbank market. Hedging offers certainty but comes with transaction costs and market impact. Optimal market making with execution has previously been addressed within the Almgren-Chriss market impact model, which includes instantaneous and permanent components. However, there is overwhelming empirical evidence of the transient nature of market impact, with instantaneous and permanent impacts arising as the two limiting cases. In this note, we consider an intermediate scenario and study the interplay between risk management and impact resilience.</description>

      <title>LQ Mean Field Games with Common Noise in Hilbert Spaces: Small and Arbitrary Finite Time Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the results of (Liu and Firoozi, 2025), which develops the theory of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games in Hilbert spaces, by incorporating a common noise. This common noise is an infinite-dimensional Wiener process affecting the dynamics of all agents. In the presence of common noise, the mean-field consistency condition is characterized by a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic evolution equations (FBSEEs) in Hilbert spaces, whereas in its absence, it is represented by forward-backward deterministic evolution equations. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the coupled linear FBSEEs associated with the LQ MFG setting for small time horizons and prove the $\epsilon$-Nash property of the resulting equilibrium strategy. Furthermore, for the first time in the literature, we develop an analysis that establishes the well-posedness of these coupled linear FBSEEs in Hilbert spaces, for which only mild solutions exist, over arbitrary finite time horizons.</description>

      <title>Measuring Financial Resilience Using Backward Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the resilience rate as a measure of financial resilience. It captures the expected rate at which a dynamic risk measure recovers, i.e., bounces back, when the risk-acceptance set is breached. We develop the corresponding stochastic calculus by establishing representation theorems for expected time-derivatives of solutions to backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with jumps, evaluated at stopping times. These results reveal that the resilience rate can be represented as a suitable expectation of the generator of a BSDE. We analyze the main properties of the resilience rate and the formal connection of these properties to the BSDE generator. We also introduce resilience-acceptance sets and study their properties in relation to both the resilience rate and the dynamic risk measure. We illustrate our results in several canonical financial examples and highlight their implications via the notion of resilience neutrality.</description>

      <title>To be or not to be: Roughness or long memory in volatility?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for composite likelihood estimation of parametric continuous-time stationary Gaussian processes. We derive the asymptotic theory of the associated maximum composite likelihood estimator. We implement our approach on a pair of models that have been proposed to describe the random log-spot variance of financial asset returns. A simulation study shows that it delivers good performance in these settings and improves upon a method-of-moments estimation. In an empirical investigation, we inspect the dynamic of an intraday measure of the spot log-realized variance computed with high-frequency data from the cryptocurrency market. The evidence supports a mechanism, where the short- and long-term correlation structure of stochastic volatility are decoupled in order to capture its properties at different time scales. This is further backed by an analysis of the associated spot log-trading volume.</description>

      <title>SANOS Smooth strictly Arbitrage-free Non-parametric Option Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, numerically efficient but highly flexible non-parametric method to construct representations of option price surfaces which are both smooth and strictly arbitrage-free across time and strike. The method can be viewed as a smooth generalization of the widely-known linear interpolation scheme, and retains the simplicity and transparency of that baseline. Calibration of the model to observed market quotes is formulated as a linear program, allowing bid-ask spreads to be incorporated directly via linear penalties or inequalities, and delivering materially lower computational cost than most of the currently available implied-volatility surface fitting routines. As a further contribution, we derive an equivalent parameterization of the proposed surface in terms of strictly positive "discrete local volatility" variables. This yields, to our knowledge, the first construction of smooth, strictly arbitrage-free option price surfaces while requiring only trivial parameter constraints (positivity). We illustrate the approach using S&amp;P 500 index options</description>
