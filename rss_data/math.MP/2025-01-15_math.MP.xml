      <title>Polyakov-Alvarez Formula for Curvilinear Polygonal Domains with Slits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $\zeta$-regularized determinant of the Friedrichs extension of the Dirichlet Laplace-Beltrami operator on curvilinear polygonal domains with corners of arbitrary positive angles. In particular, this includes slit domains. We obtain a short time asymptotic expansion of the heat trace using a classical patchwork method. This allows us to define the $\zeta$-regularized determinant of the Laplacian and prove a comparison formula of Polyakov-Alvarez type for a smooth and conformal change of metric.</description>

      <title>The one-dimensional equilibrium shape of a crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the free energy under a mass constraint may generate a convex crystal subject to assumptions on the potential $g(0)=0$, $g \ge 0$. The general problem classically attributed to Almgren is to infer if this is the case assuming the sub-level sets of g are convex. The theorem proven in the paper is that in one dimension the answer is positive.</description>

      <title>The Wigner Little Group for Photons Is a Projective Subalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Geometric Algebra approach to the Wigner little group for photons using the Spacetime Algebra, incorporating a mirror-based view for physical interpretation. The shift from a point-based view to a mirror-based view is a modern movement that allows for a more intuitive representation of geometric and physical entities, with vectors and their higher-grade counterparts viewed as hyperplanes. This reinterpretation simplifies the implementation of homogeneous representations of geometric objects within the Spacetime Algebra and enables a relative view via projective geometry. Then, after utilizing the intrinsic properties of Geometric Algebra, the Wigner little group is seen to induce a projective geometric algebra as a subalgebra of the Spacetime Algebra. However, the dimension-agnostic nature of Geometric Algebra enables the generalization of induced subalgebras to (1+n)-dimensional Minkowski geometric algebras, termed little photon algebras. The lightlike transformations (translations) in these little photon algebras are seen to leave invariant the (pseudo)canonical electromagetic field bivector. Geometrically, this corresponds to Lorentz transformations that do not change the intersection of the spacelike polarization hyperplane with the lightlike wavevector hyperplane while simultaneously not affecting the lightlike wavevector hyperplane. This provides for a framework that unifies the analysis of symmetries and substructures of point-based Geometric Algebra with mirror-based Geometric Algebra.</description>

      <title>Categorical quantum symmetries and ribbon tensor 2-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a companion work on the combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory, the author has constructed the Hopf category of quantum 2-gauge transformations $\tilde{\mathcal{C}}=\mathbb{U}_q\frak G$ acting on the discrete 2-holonomy configurations on a lattice. Guided by the 2-tangle hypothesis of Baez-Langford, we prove in this article that the 2-$\mathsf{Hilb}$-enriched 2-representation 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G};\tilde R)$ of finite semisimple $\mathbb{C}$-linear $\mathbb{U}_q\frak G$-module categories is braided, planar-pivotal, rigid and dagger, hence $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G};\tilde R)$ provides an example of a {\it ribbon tensor 2-category}. We explicitly construct the ribbon balancing functors, and show that it is compatible with the rigid dagger structures. This allows one to refine the various notions of {\it framing} in a 2-category with duals that have been previously studied in the literature. Framed 2-tangles can then be decorated by 2-representations of categorical quantum groups with a ribbon 2-functor into $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_q\mathfrak{G};\tilde R)$, completely analogous to the construction of decorated ribbon graphs in the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction. We will also prove that, in the classical limit $q=(q_\mathrm{h},q_\mathrm{v})\rightarrow 1$, the 2-category $\operatorname{2Rep}(\mathbb{U}_{q=1}\mathfrak{G};\text{id}\otimes\text{\id})$ become pivotal in the sense of Douglas-Reutter.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein distances and divergences of order $p$ by quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-quadratic generalization of the quantum mechanical optimal transport problem introduced in [De Palma and Trevisan, Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234] where quantum channels realize the transport. Relying on this general machinery, we introduce $p$-Wasserstein distances and divergences and study their fundamental geometric properties. Finally, we prove triangle inequality for quadratic Wasserstein divergences under the sole assumption that an arbitrary one of the states involved is pure, which is a generalization of our previous result in this direction.</description>

      <title>Solution to SU(n+1) Toda system generated by spherical metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the correspondence between solutions to the SU(n+1) Toda system on a Riemann surface and totally unramified unitary curves, we show that a spherical metric $\omega$ generates a family of solutions, including $(i(n+1-i)\omega)_{i=1}^n$. Moreover, we characterize this family in terms of the monodromy group of the spherical metric. As a consequence, we obtain a new solution class to the SU(n+1) Toda system with cone singularities on compact Riemann surfaces, complementing the existence results of Lin-Yang-Zhong (JDG, 114(2):337-391, 2020).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the BPHZ renormalisation via multi-indices, a combinatorial structure extremely succesful for describing scalar valued singular SPDEs. We propose the multi-indices counterpart of the Hopf algebraic program initiated by Connes and Kreimer on the renormalisation of Feynman diagrams. The construction relies on a well-chosen extraction-contraction coproduct of multi-indices equipped with a correct symmetry factor. We illustrate our construction on the renormalisation of the $ \Phi^4 $ measure.</description>

      <title>The large time asymptotics of nonlinear multichannel Schroedinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Schroedinger equation with a general interaction term, which is localized in space. The interaction may be x, t dependent and non-linear. Purely non-linear parts of the interaction are localized via the radial Sobolev embedding. Under the assumption of radial symmetry and boundedness in H1(R3) of the solution, uniformly in time. we prove it is asymptotic in L2 (and H1) in the strong sense, to a free wave and a weakly localized solution. The general properties of the localized solutions are derived. The proof is based on the introduction of phase-space analysis of the nonlinear dispersive dynamics and relies on a new class of (exterior) a priory propagation estimates. This approach allows a unified analysis of general linear time-dependent potentials and non-linear interactions.</description>

      <title>Mixing time for a noisy SIS model on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of the noisy SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model on graphs. The noisy SIS model is a variant of the standard SIS model, which allows individuals to become infected not just due to contacts with infected individuals but also due to external noise. We show that, under strong external noise, the mixing time is of order $O(n \log n)$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the mixing time on random graphs, namely Erd\"os--R\'enyi graphs, regular multigraphs, and Galton--Watson trees, is also of order $O(n \log n)$ with high probability.</description>

      <title>SymSETs and self-dualities under gauging non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-duality defects under discrete gauging in a categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ can be classified by inequivalent ways of enriching the bulk SymTFT of $\mathcal{C}$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ 0-form symmetry. The resulting Symmetry Enriched Topological (SET) orders will be referred to as $\textit{SymSETs}$ and are parameterized by choices of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, as well as symmetry fractionalization classes and discrete torsions. In this work, we consider self-dualities under gauging $\textit{non-invertible}$ $0$-form symmetries in $2$-dim QFTs and explore their SymSETs. Unlike the simpler case of self-dualities under gauging finite Abelian groups, the SymSETs here generally admit multiple choices of fractionalization classes. We provide a direct construction of the SymSET from a given duality defect using its $\textit{relative center}$. Using the SymSET, we show explicitly that changing fractionalization classes can change fusion rules of the duality defect besides its $F$-symbols. We consider three concrete examples: the maximal gauging of $\operatorname{Rep} H_8$, the non-maximal gauging of the duality defect $\mathcal{N}$ in $\operatorname{Rep} H_8$ and $\operatorname{Rep} D_8$ respectively. The latter two cases each result in 6 fusion categories with two types of fusion rules related by changing fractionalization class. In particular, two self-dualities of $\operatorname{Rep} D_8$ related by changing the fractionalization class lead to $\operatorname{Rep} D_{16}$ and $\operatorname{Rep} SD_{16}$ respectively. Finally, we study the physical implications such as the spin selection rules and the SPT phases for the aforementioned categories.</description>

      <title>Richardson-Gaudin states of non-zero seniority I: matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seniority-zero wavefunctions describe bond-breaking processes qualitatively. As eigenvectors of a model Hamiltonian, Richardson-Gaudin states provide a clear physical picture and allow for systematic improvement via standard single reference approaches. Until now, this treatment has been done in the seniority-zero channel. In this manuscript, the corresponding states with higher seniorities are identified, and their couplings through the Coulomb Hamiltonian are computed. In every case, the couplings between the states are computed from the cofactors of their effective overlap matrix. Proof of principle calculations demonstrate that a single reference configuration interaction is comparable with seniority-based configuration interaction computations at a substantially reduced cost. The next manuscript in this series will identify the corresponding Slater-Condon rules and make the computations feasible.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the asymptotic expansions of super intersection numbers and prove that the associated coefficients are polynomials. Moreover, we give an algorithm which can explicitly compute these coefficients. As an application, we prove the existence of a complete asymptotic expansion of super Weil-Petersson volumes in the large genus. This generalizes the celebrated work of Mirzakhani-Zograf. We also confirm two conjectural formulae proposed by Griguolo-Papalini-Russo-Seminara.</description>

Abstract: Quasi-periodic solutions of the sin-Gordon equation are expressed in terms of $\wp_{1,2g-1}$-function, and reality conditions are completely determined. This new result leads to numerical computation and graphical representation of non-linear wave solutions. A way of obtaining finite-gap solutions by means of algebro-geometric integration is also explained, and a construction of the sin-Gordon hierarchy on coadjoint orbits of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ loop group is addressed.</description>

      <title>The Clifford hierarchy for one qubit or qudit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clifford hierarchy is a nested sequence of sets of quantum gates that can be fault-tolerantly performed using gate teleportation within standard quantum error correction schemes. The groups of Pauli and Clifford gates constitute the first and second 'levels', respectively. Non-Clifford gates from the third level or higher, such as the $T$ gate, are necessary for achieving fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Since it was defined twenty-five years ago by Gottesman-Chuang, two questions have been studied by numerous researchers. First, precisely which gates constitute the Clifford hierarchy? Second, which subset of the hierarchy gates admit efficient gate teleportation protocols?
  We completely solve both questions in the practically-relevant case of the Clifford hierarchy for gates of one qubit or one qudit of prime dimension. We express every such hierarchy gate uniquely as a product of three simple gates, yielding also a formula for the size of every level. These results are a consequence of our finding that all such hierarchy gates can be expressed in a certain form that guarantees efficient gate teleportation. Our decomposition of Clifford gates as a unique product of three elementary Clifford gates is of broad applicability.</description>

Abstract: The study of complex functions is based around the study of holomorphic functions, satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The relatively recent field of Clifford Analysis lets us extend many results from Complex Analysis to higher dimensions. In this paper, I decompose the Cauchy-Riemann equations for a general Clifford algebra into grades using the Geometric Algebra formalism, and show that for the Spacetime Algebra $Cl(3,1)$ these equations are the equations for a self-dual source free Maxwell field, and for a massless uncharged Spinor. This shows a deep link between fundamental physics and the Clifford geometry of Spacetime.</description>

Abstract: On differential manifolds with spinor structure, it is possible to express the Euler and Pontryagin currents in terms of tensors that also appear as source in the Dirac equation. It is hence possible to tie concepts rooted in geometry and topology to dynamical characters of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Effective Polaron Dynamics of an Impurity Particle Interacting with a Fermi Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a homogeneous ideal Fermi gas coupled to an impurity particle on a three-dimensional box with periodic boundary condition. For large Fermi momentum $k_\text{F}$, we prove that the effective dynamics is generated by a Fr\"ohlich-type polaron Hamiltonian, which linearly couples the impurity particle to an almost-bosonic excitation field. Moreover, we prove that the effective dynamics can be approximated by an explicit coupled coherent state. Our method is applicable to a range of interaction couplings, in particular including interaction couplings of order 1 and time scales of the order $k_\text{F}^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: We study the time evolution of an initial product state in a system of almost-bosonic-extended-anyons in the large-particle limit. We show that the dynamics of this system can be well approximated, in finite time, by a product state evolving under the effective Chern--Simons--Schr\"odinger equation. Furthermore, we provide a convergence rate for the approximation in terms of the radius $R = (\log N)^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}$ of the extended anyons. These results establish a rigorous connection between the microscopic dynamics of almost-bosonic-anyon gases and the emergent macroscopic behavior described by the Chern--Simons--Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a paper by T. Chakradhar, K. Gittins, G. Habib and N. Peyerimhoff, we analyze their conjecture that the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator tends to infinity as the magnetic field tends to infinity. More precisely, we prove refined conjectures for general two dimensional domains, based on the analysis in the case of the half-plane and the disk by two of us (B.H. and F.N.). We also extend our analysis to the three dimensional case, and explore a connection with the eigenvalue asymptotics of the magnetic Robin Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Segal-Bargmann transforms and generalized Weyl algebras associated with the Meixner class of orthogonal polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meixner (1934) proved that there exist exactly five classes of orthogonal Sheffer sequences: Hermite polynomials which are orthogonal with respect to Gaussian distribution, Charlier polynomials orthogonal with respect to Poisson distribution, Laguerre polynomials orthogonal with respect to gamma distribution, Meixner polynomials of the first kind, orthogonal with respect to negative binomial distribution, and Meixner polynomials of the second kind, orthogonal with respect to Meixner distribution. The Segal-Bargmann transform provides a unitary isomorphism between the $L^2$-space of the Gaussian distribution and the Fock or Segal-Bargmann space of entire functions. This construction was also extended to the case of the Poisson distribution. The present paper deals with the latter three classes of orthogonal Sheffer sequences. By using a set of nonlinear coherent states, we construct a generalized Segal-Bargmann transform which is a unitary isomorphism between the $L^2$-space of the orthogonality measure and a certain Fock space of entire functions. In a special case, such a Fock space was already studied by Alpay-Jorgensen-Seager-Volok (2013) and Alpay-Porat (2018). To derive our results, we use normal ordering in generalized Weyl algebras that are naturally associated with the orthogonal Sheffer sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ matrix product states (MPS) and tensor networks to study topological properties of the space of ground states of gapped many-body systems. We focus on families of states in one spatial dimension, where each state can be represented as an injective MPS of finite bond dimension. Such states are short-range entangled ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. To such parametrized families over $X$ we associate a gerbe, which generalizes the line bundle of ground states in zero-dimensional families (\emph{i.e.} in few-body quantum mechanics). The nontriviality of the gerbe is measured by a class in $H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$, which is believed to classify one-dimensional parametrized systems. We show that when the gerbe is nontrivial, there is an obstruction to representing the family of ground states with an MPS tensor that is continuous everywhere on $X$. We illustrate our construction with two examples of nontrivial parametrized systems over $X=S^3$ and $X = \mathbb{R} P^2 \times S^1$. Finally, we sketch using tensor network methods how the construction extends to higher dimensional parametrized systems, with an example of a two-dimensional parametrized system that gives rise to a nontrivial 2-gerbe over $X = S^4$.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses the question of Stable Facts in Relational Quantum Mechanics. I examine how the approach to quantum logic in the consistent histories formalism can be used to clarify what information about a system can be shared between different observers.I suggest that the mathematical framework for Consistent Histories can and should be incorporated into RQM, whilst being clear on the interpretational differences between the two approaches. Finally I briefly discuss two related issues: the similarities and differences between special relativity and RQM and the recent Cross- Perspectival Links modification to RQM.</description>

      <title>Extracting Error Thresholds through the Framework of Approximate Quantum Error Correction Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of quantum memory against physical noises is measured by two methods: the exact and approximate quantum error correction (QEC) conditions for error recoverability, and the decoder-dependent error threshold which assesses if the logical error rate diminishes with system size. Here we unravel their relations and propose a unified framework to extract an intrinsic error threshold from the approximate QEC condition, which could upper bound other decoder-dependent error thresholds. Our proof establishes that relative entropy, effectively measuring deviations from exact QEC conditions, serves as the order parameter delineating the transition from asymptotic recoverability to unrecoverability. Consequently, we establish a unified framework for determining the error threshold across both exact and approximate QEC codes, addressing errors originating from noise channels as well as those from code space imperfections. This result sharpens our comprehension of error thresholds across diverse QEC codes and error models.</description>

Abstract: We consider random matrices whose shape is the dilation $N\lambda$ of a self-conjugate Young diagram $\lambda$. In the large-$N$ limit, the empirical distribution of the squared singular values converges almost surely to a probability distribution $F^{\lambda}$. The moments of $F^{\lambda}$ enumerate two combinatorial objects: $\lambda$-plane trees and $\lambda$-Dyck paths, which we introduce and show to be in bijection. We also prove that the distribution $F^{\lambda}$ is algebraic, in the sense of Rao and Edelman. In the case of fat hook shapes we provide explicit formulae for $F^{\lambda}$ and we express it as a free convolution of two measures involving a Marchenko-Pastur and a Bernoulli distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a suitable finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent expansion and field-theoretic renormalization group for a singular nonlinear diffusion equation with anomalous scaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The method of self-consistent expansions is a powerful tool for handling strong coupling problems that might otherwise be beyond the reach of perturbation theory, providing surprisingly accurate approximations even at low order. First applied in its embryonic form to fully-developed turbulence, it has subsequently been successfully applied to a variety of problems that include polymer statistics, interface dynamics and high order perturbation theory for the anharmonic oscillator. Here we show that the self-consistent expansion can be applied to singular perturbation problems arising in the theory of partial differential equations. We demonstrate its application to Barenblatt's nonlinear diffusion equation for porous media filtration, where the long-time asymptotics exhibits anomalous dimensions that can be systematically calculated using the perturbative renormalization group. We find that even the first order self-consistent expansion improves the approximation of the anomalous dimension obtained by the first-order perturbative renormalization group, especially in the strong coupling regime. We also develop a field-theoretic framework for deterministic partial differential equations to facilitate the application of self-consistent expansions to other dynamic systems, and illustrate its application using the example of Barenblatt's equation. The scope of our results on the combination of renormalization group and self-consistent expansions is limited to partial differential equations whose long-time asymptotics is controlled by incomplete similarity. However, our work suggests that these methods could be applied to a broader suite of singular perturbation problems such as boundary layer theory, multiple scales analysis and matched asymptotic expansions, for which excellent approximations using renormalization group methods alone are already available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider general linear gauge theory, with independent solder form and connection. These spaces have both torsion and nonmetricity. We show that the Cartan structure equations together with the defining equation for nonmetricity allow the mixed symmetry components of nonmetricity to be absorbed into an altered torsion tensor. Field redefinitions reduce the structure equations to those of Poincare gauge theory, with local Lorentz symmetry and metric compatibility. In order to allow recovery the original torsion and nonmetric fields, we replace the definition of nonmetricity by an additional structure equation and demand integrability of the extended system. We show that the maximal Lie algebra compatible with the enlarged set is isomorphic to the conformal Lie algebra. From this Lorentzian conformal geometry, we establish that the difference between the field strength of special conformal transformations and the torsion and is given by the mixed symmetry nonmetricity of an equivalent asymmetric system.</description>

Abstract: This article encloses the derivation of Darboux solutions for Kaup Kupershmidt equations with their generalization in determinantal form. One of the main focuses of this work is to construct the Backlund transformation for the different solutions of that equation through its associated Riccati equation and then that transformations further reduces to its algebraic analogue with the help of One-fold Darboux solution. Finally, its exact solutions upto three solitons are calculated with their graphical representations which reveal dynamical profiles of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimal trace-distance bounds for free-fermionic states: Testing and improved tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free-fermionic states, also known as fermionic Gaussian states, represent an important class of quantum states ubiquitous in physics. They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.</description>
