      <title>Asymptotic stability of the spectra of generalized indefinite strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the asymptotic stability of the spectra of generalized indefinite strings (GISs). A unitarily equivalent linear relation is introduced for GISs. It is shown that the solutions of the corresponding differential equations are continuously dependent on distributions and measures under certain conditions. Using these results, the convergence of unitarily equivalent linear relations for GISs is discussed. By the perturbation theory to closed linear relations, an asymptotic stability result concerning the spectra of linear relations for GISs is obtained.</description>

      <title>The Topology of the Unitary Dual of Crystallography Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a procedure for generating the irreducible representations of crystallography groups in any dimension. We also furnish a strategy to investigate the topology of the unitary dual of a crystallography group using sequences of matrices. All irreducible representations (up to unitary equivalence) of the dimension 3 crystallography group 90 and some calculations involving sequences of these irreducible representations are included as a proof of concept of this procedure and strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the surjective isometries of the unit sphere of real Schreier spaces of all orders and their $p$-convexifications, for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. This description allows us to provide for those spaces a positive answer to a special case of Tingley's problem, which asks whether every surjective isometry of the unit sphere of a real Banach space can be extended to a linear isometry of the entire space.</description>

      <title>Construction of generalized samplets in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, samplets have been introduced as localized discrete signed measures which are tailored to an underlying data set. Samplets exhibit vanishing moments, i.e., their measure integrals vanish for all polynomials up to a certain degree, which allows for feature detection and data compression. In the present article, we extend the different construction steps of samplets to functionals in Banach spaces more general than point evaluations. To obtain stable representations, we assume that these functionals form frames with square-summable coefficients or even Riesz bases with square-summable coefficients. In either case, the corresponding analysis operator is injective and we obtain samplet bases with the desired properties by means of constructing an isometry of the analysis operator's image. Making the assumption that the dual of the Banach space under consideration is imbedded into the space of compactly supported distributions, the multilevel hierarchy for the generalized samplet construction is obtained by spectral clustering of a similarity graph for the functionals' supports. Based on this multilevel hierarchy, generalized samplets exhibit vanishing moments with respect to a given set of primitives within the Banach space. We derive an abstract localization result for the generalized samplet coefficients with respect to the samplets' support sizes and the approximability of the Banach space elements by the chosen primitives. Finally, we present three examples showcasing the generalized samplet framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{B} (X)$ be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on an infinite-dimensional complex Banach space $X$. In this note, we show that a lemma used in the proof of the main result of [ Taghavi and Hosseinzadeh, linear and Multilinear algebra (2013) 1285-1292.] has an incorrect proof. Then, instead of such a lemma, we provide two elementary lemmas to obtain a proof of Taghavi and Hosseinzadeh's main result free of errors.</description>

      <title>$DW$-DP operators and $DW$-limited operators on Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of two classes of operators related to disjointly weakly compact sets, which we call $DW$-DP operators and $DW$-limited operators, respectively. They carry disjointly weakly compact subsets of a Banach lattice onto Dunford-Pettis sets and limited sets, respectively. We show that $DW$-DP (resp. $DW$-limited) operators are precisely the operators which are both weak Dunford-Pettis and order Dunford-Pettis (resp. weak$^*$ Dunford-Pettis and order limited) operators. Furthermore, the approximation properties of positive $DW$-DP and positive $DW$-limited operators are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a new class of operators known as polynomially hypo-EP operators, extending the notation of hypo-EP, $n$-hypo-EP, and polynomially EP. The paper explores numerous properties and characterizations of polynomially hypo-EP operators and polynomially EP operators. In addition, we characterize polynomially hypo-EP operators applying the adequate operator matrix representations. By employing these findings, we derive new characterizations of EP, hypo-EP, $n$-EP and $n$-hypo-EP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the notions of numerical radius parallelism and numerical radius Birkhoff orthogonality, originally formulated for operators on Hilbert spaces, to operators on normed spaces. We then proceed to demonstrate their fundamental properties. Notably, our findings reveal that numerical radius parallelism lacks transitivity, and numerical radius Birkhoff orthogonality is neither left nor right additive. Additionally, we offer characterizations for both concepts. Furthermore, we establish a connection between numerical radius parallelism and numerical radius Birkhoff orthogonality.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to spacetime bulk reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of holographic quantum error correction in the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, together with the kink transform conjecture on the bulk AdS description of boundary cocycle flow, we characterize (approximate) complementary recovery in terms of (approximate) intertwining of bulk and boundary cocycle derivatives. Using the geometric modular structure in vacuum AdS, we establish an operator algebraic subregion-subregion duality of boundary causal diamonds and bulk causal wedges for Klein-Gordon fields in the universal cover of AdS. Our results suggest that, from an algebraic perspective, the kink transform is bulk cocycle flow, which (in the above case) induces the bulk geometry via geometric modular action and the corresponding notion of time. As a by-product, we find that if the von Neumann algebra of a boundary CFT subregion is a type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factor with an ergodic vacuum, then the von Neumann algebra of the corresponding dual bulk subregion, is either $\mathbb{C}1$ (with a one-dimensional Hilbert space) or a type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factor.</description>

Abstract: We define and study notions of amenability and skew-amenability of continuous actions of topological groups on compact topological spaces. Our main motivation is the question under what conditions amenability of a topological group passes to a closed subgroup. Other applications include the understanding of the universal minimal flow of various non-amenable groups.</description>

      <title>A noncommutative integral on spectrally truncated spectral triples, and a link with quantum ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple approximation of the noncommutative integral in noncommutative geometry for the Connes--Van Suijlekom paradigm of spectrally truncated spectral triples. A close connection between this approximation and the field of quantum ergodicity and work by Widom in particular immediately provides a Szeg\H{o} limit formula for noncommutative geometry. Finally, we propose a definition for the ergodicity of geodesic flow for compact spectral triples. This definition is known in quantum ergodicity as uniqueness of the vacuum state for $C^*$-dynamical systems, and for spectral triples where local Weyl laws hold this implies that the Dirac operator of the spectral triple is quantum ergodic. This brings to light a close connection between quantum ergodicity and Connes' integral formula.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for continuous uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following seminal work in the early 1980s that established the existence and representations of the homogenized transport coefficients for two phase random media, we develop a mathematical framework that provides Stieltjes integral representations for the bulk transport coefficients for uniaxial polycrystalline materials, involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators, which are compositions of non-random and random projection operators. We demonstrate the same mathematical framework also describes two-component composites, with a simple substitution of the random projection operator, making the mathematical descriptions of these two distinct physical systems directly analogous to one another. A detailed analysis establishes the operators arising in each setting are indeed self-adjoint on an $L^2$-type Hilbert space, providing a rigorous foundation to the formal spectral theoretic framework established by Golden and Papanicolaou in 1983. An abstract extension of the Helmholtz theorem also leads to integral representations for the inverses of effective parameters, e.g., effective conductivity and resistivity. An alternate formulation of the effective parameter problem in terms of a Sobolev-type Hilbert space provides a rigorous foundation for an approach first established by Bergman and Milton. We show that the correspondence between the two formulations is a one-to-one isometry. Rigorous bounds that follow from such Stieltjes integrals and partial knowledge about the material geometry are reviewed and validated by numerical calculations of the effective parameters for polycrystalline media.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of Wasserstein barycenter I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Wasserstein barycenter problem in the setting of non-compact, non-smooth extended metric measure spaces. We introduce a couple of new concepts and obtain the existence, uniqueness, absolute continuity of the Wasserstein barycenter, and prove Jensen's inequality in an abstract framework.
  This generalized several results on Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds and Alexandrov spaces, to metric measure spaces satisfying Riemannian Curvature-Dimension condition \`a la Lott--Sturm--Villani, and some extended metric measure spaces including abstract Wiener spaces and configuration spaces over Riemannian manifolds.
  We also introduce a new curvature-dimesion condition, we call Barycenter-Curvature-Dimension condition {\rm BCD}. We prove its stability under measured-Gromov--Hausdorff convergence and prove the existence of the Wasserstein barycenter under this new condition. In addition, we get some geometric inequalities including a multi-marginal Brunn--Minkowski inequality and a functional Blaschke--Santal\'o type inequality.</description>

Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant measure for the associated weakly ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the so-called $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

Abstract: The Nelson model describes non-relativistic particles coupled to a relativistic Bose scalar field. In this article, we study the renormalized version of the Nelson model with massless bosons in Davies' weak coupling limit. Our main result states that the two-body Coulomb potential emerges as an effective pair interaction between the particles, which arises from the exchange of virtual excitations of the quantum field.</description>

Abstract: We develop a robust functional analytic framework for adiabatic limits. This framework consist of a notion of adiabatic Fredholm family, several possible regularity properties, and an explicit construction that provides finite dimensional reductions that fit into all common regularization theories. We show that thhese finite dimensional reductions inherit global continuity and differentiability properties from the adiabatic Fredholm family. Moreover, we indicate how to construct adiabatic Fredholm families that describe the adiabatic limits for the nondegenerate Atiyah-Floer conjecture and strip-shrinking in quilted Floer theory.</description>

Abstract: We show that much of the theory of finite tight frames can be generalised to vector spaces over the quaternions. This includes the variational characterisation, group frames, and the characterisations of projective and unitary equivalence. We are particularly interested in sets of equiangular lines (equi-isoclinic subspaces) and the groups associated with them, and how to move them between the spaces $\Rd$, $\Cd$ and $\Hd$. We discuss what the analogue of Zauner's conjecture for equiangular lines in $\Hd$ might be.</description>

      <title>Wiener-Luxemburg amalgam spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the concept of Wiener-Luxemburg amalgam spaces which are a modification of the more classical Wiener amalgam spaces intended to address some of the shortcomings the latter face in the context of rearrangement-invariant Banach function spaces.
  We introduce the Wiener-Luxemburg amalgam spaces and study their properties, including (but nor limited to) their normability, embeddings between them and their associate spaces. We also study amalgams of quasi-Banach function spaces and introduce a necessary generalisation of the concept of associate spaces. We then apply this general theory to resolve the question whether the Hardy-Littlewood-P\'{o}lya principle holds for all r.i. quasi-Banach function spaces. Finally, we illustrate the asserted shortcomings of Wiener amalgam spaces by providing counterexamples to certain properties of Banach function spaces as well as rearrangement invariance.</description>

      <title>Localisation of Regularised and Multiview Support Vector Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05655v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a few representer theorems for a localised version of the regularised and multiview support vector machine learning problem introduced by H.Q. Minh, L. Bazzani, and V. Murino, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17(2016) 1-72, that involves operator valued positive semidefinite kernels and their reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The results concern general cases when convex or nonconvex loss functions and finite or infinite dimensional input spaces are considered. We show that the general framework allows infinite dimensional input spaces and nonconvex loss functions for some special cases, in particular in case the loss functions are Gateaux differentiable. Detailed calculations are provided for the exponential least squares loss functions that lead to systems of partially nonlinear equations for which a particular different types of Newton's approximation methods based on the interior point method can be used. Some numerical experiments are performed on a toy model that illustrate the tractability of the methods that we propose.</description>

      <title>Weak Compactness Criterion in $ W^{k, 1} $ with an Existence Theorem of Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a rich theory of existence theorems for minimizers over reflexive Sobolev spaces (ex. Eberlein-\v{S}mulian theorem). However, the existence theorems for many variational problems over non-reflexive Sobolev spaces remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate various examples of functionals over non-reflexive Sobolev spaces. To do this, we prove a weak compactness criterion in $W^{k,1}$ that generalizes the Dunford-Pettis theorem, which asserts that relatively weakly compact subsets of $ L^1 $ coincide with equi-integrable families. As a corollary, we also extend an existence theorem of minimizers from reflexive Sobolev spaces to non-reflexive ones. This work is also benefited and streamlined by various concepts in category theory.</description>

      <title>Multiplier algebras of $L^p$-operator algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the multiplier algebra of an approximately unital and nondegenerate $L^p$-operator algebra is again an $L^p$-operator algebra. In this paper we investigate examples that drop both hypotheses. In particular, we show that the multiplier algebra of $T_2^p$, the algebra of strictly upper triangular $2 \times 2$ matrices acting on $\ell_2^p$, is still an $L^p$-operator algebra for any $p$. To contrast this result, we first provide a thorough study of the augmentation ideal of $\ell^1(G)$ for a discrete group $G$. We use this ideal to define a family of nonapproximately unital degenerate $L^p$-operator algebras, $F_{0}^p(\Bbb{Z}/3\Bbb{Z})$, whose multiplier algebras cannot be represented on any $L^q$-space for any $q \in [1, \infty)$ as long as $p \in [1, p_0] \cup [p_0', \infty)$, where $p_0=1.606$ and $p_0'$ is its H\"older conjugate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$, it is well-known that the kernel of the Hankel operator is invariant under the action of shift operator S and sometimes nearly invariant under the action of backward shift operator $S^{*}$. It appears in this paper that kernels of finite rank perturbations of Hankel operators are almost shift invariant as well as nearly $S^*$- invariant with finite defect. This allows us to obtain a structure of the kernel in several important cases by applying a recent theorem due to Chalendar, Gallardo, and Partington.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate and characterize linear functionals $L:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}$ with absolutely continuous representing measures $\mu$, i.e., $\mathrm{d}\mu(x) = g(x)\,\mathrm{d} x$ for some density $g$. We focus on the regularity of $g$ and how it is influenced/determined by the moments $s_\alpha = L(x^\alpha)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the class of admissible functions for the trace formula of the second order in the self-adjoint, unitary, and contraction cases for a perturbation in the Hilbert-Schmidt class $\mathcal{S}^2(\mathcal{H})$ by assuming a certain factorization of the divided difference $f^{[2]}$. This class is the natural one to ensure that the second order Taylor remainder is a trace class operator. It encompasses all the classes of functions for which the trace formula was previously known. Secondly, for a Schatten $\mathcal{S}^p$-perturbation, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, we prove general modified trace formulas for every $n$-times differentiable functions with bounded $n$-th derivative in the self-adjoint and unitary cases and for every $f$ such that $f$ and its derivatives are in the disk algebra $\mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D})$ in the contraction case.</description>

Abstract: We revisit homogenisation theory for Friedrichs systems. In particular, we show that $G$-compactness can be obtained under severely weaker assumptions than in the original work of Burazin and Vrdoljak (2014). In this way we extend the applicability of $G$-compactness results for Friedrichs systems to equations that yield memory effects in the homogenised limit and detour any usage of compactness techniques previously employed.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Nica-Pimsner quotients associated with strong compactly aligned product systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We parametrise the gauge-invariant ideals of the Toeplitz-Nica-Pimsner algebra of a strong compactly aligned product system over $\mathbb{Z}_+^d$ by using $2^d$-tuples of ideals of the coefficient algebra that are invariant, partially ordered, and maximal. We give an algebraic characterisation of maximality that allows the iteration of a $2^d$-tuple to the maximal one inducing the same gauge-invariant ideal. The parametrisation respects inclusions and intersections, while we characterise the join operation on the $2^d$-tuples that renders the parametrisation a lattice isomorphism.
  The problem of the parametrisation of the gauge-invariant ideals is equivalent to the study of relative Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner algebras, for which we provide a generalised Gauge-Invariant Uniqueness Theorem. We focus further on equivariant quotients of the Cuntz-Nica-Pimsner algebra and provide applications to regular product systems, C*-dynamical systems, strong finitely aligned higher-rank graphs, and product systems on finite frames. In particular, we provide a description of the parametrisation for (possibly non-automorphic) C*-dynamical systems and row-finite higher-rank graphs, which squares with known results when restricting to crossed products and to locally convex row-finite higher-rank graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an arbitrary subset $E\subset\mathbb{R}^n,$ we introduce and study the three vanishing subspaces of the H\"older space $\dot{C}^{0,\omega}(E)$ consisting of those functions for which the ratio $|f(x)-f(y)|/\omega(|x-y|)$ vanishes, when $(1)$ $|x-y|\to 0$ , $(2)$ $|x-y|\to\infty$ or $(3)$ $\min(|x|,|y|)\to\infty.$ We prove that the Whitney extension operator maps each of these vanishing subspaces from $E$ to the corresponding vanishing spaces defined on the whole ambient space $\mathbb{R}^n.$ In fact, this follows as the zeroth order special case of a more general problem involving higher order derivatives. As a consequence, we obtain complete characterizations of approximability of H\"older functions $\dot{C}^{0,\omega}(E)$ by Lipschitz and boundedly supported functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

      <title>Extremal models and direct integrals in affine logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine logic is a fragment of continuous logic, introduced by Bagheri, in which only affine functions are allowed as connectives. This has the effect of endowing type spaces with the structure of compact convex sets. We study extremal models of affine theories (those that only realize extreme types), and the ways and conditions under which all models can be described from the extremal ones.
  We introduce and develop the general theory of measurable fields of metric structures and their direct integrals. One of our main results is an extremal decomposition theorem for models of simplicial theories, that is, affine theories whose type spaces form Choquet simplices. We prove that every model of a simplicial theory can be (uniquely) decomposed as a direct integral of extremal models. This generalizes known decomposition results (ergodic decomposition, tracial von Neumann factor decomposition), and moreover, holds without any separability hypothesis.
  Two extreme kinds of simplicial theories are Bauer theories, whose extreme types form a closed set, and Poulsen theories, whose extreme types form a dense set. We show that Keisler randomizations of continuous theories are, essentially, the same thing as affine Bauer theories. We establish a dichotomy result: a complete simplicial theory is either Bauer or Poulsen.
  As part of our analysis, we adapt many results and tools from continuous logic to the affine or extremal contexts (definability, saturation, type isolation, categoricity, etc.). We also provide a detailed study of the relations between continuous logic and affine logic.
  Finally, we present several examples of simplicial theories arising from theories in discrete logic, Hilbert spaces, probability measure-preserving systems, and tracial von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>A New Linear Programming Method in Sphere Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the linear programming method developed by Cohn and Elkies (Ann. Math. 157(2): 689-714, 2003), we introduce a new linear programming method to solve the sphere packing problem. More concretely, we consider sequences of auxiliary functions $\{g_m\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}^{+}}$, where $g_m$ is a $m\Lambda$-periodic auxiliary function defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $\Lambda$ being a given full-rank lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This new method extends the original approach and offers a greater flexibility. Furthermore, using this new linear programming framework, we construct several effective auxiliary functions for dimensions $n=1,2,3$. We hope this approach provides valuable insights into solving sphere packing problems for $n=2,3$ and even higher dimensions.</description>
