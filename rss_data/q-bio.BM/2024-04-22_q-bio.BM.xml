      <title>Limits on Inferring T-cell Specificity from Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in molecular biology is to decipher the mapping of protein sequence to function. To perform this mapping requires the identification of sequence features most informative about function. Here, we quantify the amount of information (in bits) that T-cell receptor (TCR) sequence features provide about antigen specificity. We identify informative features by their degree of conservation among antigen-specific receptors relative to null expectations. We find that TCR specificity synergistically depends on the hypervariable regions of both receptor chains, with a degree of synergy that strongly depends on the ligand. Using a coincidence-based approach to measuring information enables us to directly bound the accuracy with which TCR specificity can be predicted from partial matches to reference sequences. We anticipate that our statistical framework will be of use for developing machine learning models for TCR specificity prediction and for optimizing TCRs for cell therapies. The proposed coincidence-based information measures might find further applications in bounding the performance of pairwise classifiers in other fields.</description>

      <title>Mapping the path to Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography Analysis of biomolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The understanding of protein structure, folding, and interaction with other proteins remains one of the grand challenges of modern biology. Tremendous progress has been made thanks to X-ray- or electron-based techniques that have provided atomic configurations of proteins, and their solvation shell. These techniques though require a large number of similar molecules to provide an average view, and lack detailed compositional information that might play a major role in the biochemical activity of these macromolecules. Based on its intrinsic performance and recent impact in materials science, atom probe tomography (APT) has been touted as a potential novel tool to analyse biological materials, including proteins. However, analysis of biomolecules in their native, hydrated state by APT have not yet been routinely achieved, and the technique's true capabilities remain to be demonstrated. Here, we present and discuss systematic analyses of individual amino-acids in frozen aqueous solutions on two different nanoporous metal supports across a wide range of analysis conditions. Using a ratio of the molecular ions of water as a descriptor for the conditions of electrostatic field, we study the fragmentation and behavior of those amino acids. We discuss the importance sample support, specimen preparation route, acquisition conditions and data analysis, to pave the way towards establishing guidelines for cryo-APT analysis of biomolecules.</description>

      <title>A general Temperature-Guided Language model to engineer enhanced Stability and Activity in Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing protein mutants with high stability and activity is a critical yet challenging task in protein engineering. Here, we introduce PRIME, an innovative deep learning approach for the zero-shot prediction of both protein stability and enzymatic activity. PRIME leverages temperature-guided language modelling, providing robust and precise predictions without relying on prior experimental mutagenesis data. Tested against 33 protein datasets, PRIME demonstrated superior predictive performance and generalizability compared to current state-of-the-art models</description>

      <title>MultiModal-Learning for Predicting Molecular Properties: A Framework Based on Image and Graph Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for accurate prediction of drug molecule properties poses a fundamental challenge in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Drug Discovery (AIDD). An effective representation of drug molecules emerges as a pivotal component in this pursuit. Contemporary leading-edge research predominantly resorts to self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to extract meaningful structural representations from large-scale, unlabeled molecular data, subsequently fine-tuning these representations for an array of downstream tasks. However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular reliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or SMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of various molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG, a novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular properties based on Image and Graph structures. MolIG model innovatively leverages the coherence and correlation between molecule graph and molecule image to execute self-supervised tasks, effectively amalgamating the strengths of both molecular representation forms. This holistic approach allows for the capture of pivotal molecular structural characteristics and high-level semantic information. Upon completion of pre-training, Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder is used for the prediction of downstream tasks. In comparison to advanced baseline models, MolIG exhibits enhanced performance in downstream tasks pertaining to molecular property prediction within benchmark groups such as MoleculeNet Benchmark Group and ADMET Benchmark Group.</description>

      <title>MolTailor: Tailoring Chemical Molecular Representation to Specific Tasks via Text Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is now widely used in drug discovery, providing significant acceleration and cost reduction. As the most fundamental building block, molecular representation is essential for predicting molecular properties to enable various downstream applications. Most existing methods attempt to incorporate more information to learn better representations. However, not all features are equally important for a specific task. Ignoring this would potentially compromise the training efficiency and predictive accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, which treats language models as an agent and molecular pretraining models as a knowledge base. The agent accentuates task-relevant features in the molecular representation by understanding the natural language description of the task, just as a tailor customizes clothes for clients. Thus, we call this approach MolTailor. Evaluations demonstrate MolTailor's superior performance over baselines, validating the efficacy of enhancing relevance for molecular representation learning. This illustrates the potential of language model guided optimization to better exploit and unleash the capabilities of existing powerful molecular representation methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/SCIR-HI/MolTailor.</description>
