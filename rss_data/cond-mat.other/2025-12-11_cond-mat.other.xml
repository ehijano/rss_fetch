      <title>A First Look at Hydrogen Generation in an Ultramafic Rock with Micro-CT and SEM-BEX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural hydrogen generated by water-rock interaction in ultramafic rocks is increasingly recognised as a potentially important primary energy resource, but the pore-scale processes that control the initiation and early transport of a free gas phase remain poorly constrained. Here we present an in situ X-ray micro-tomography experiment in which an ultramafic granular pack of dunnite from West Papua, Indonesia, saturated with KI-doped brine, is heated to 100C with a pore pressure of 4bar under 10bar confining pressure inside a micro-CT scanner. Time-resolved 4D imaging captures the transition from a fully liquid-saturated pore space to the appearance and growth of a distinct gas phase after an 8h induction period. Bubbles first nucleate near the top of the sample before becoming distributed throughout the imaged volume as a connected ganglia. The nucleating gas phase is most plausibly dominated by molecular hydrogen generated by low-temperature fluid-rock reaction, as indicated by independent hydrogen-presence detectors, although we cannot yet fully exclude minor contributions from other gases. SEM-BEX imaging reveals textural alteration and local changes in elemental signals between reacted and unreacted material. Taken together, these observations provide spatially and temporally resolved evidence for gas generation during low-temperature alteration of ultramafic grains and demonstrate that pore-scale imaging can directly link water-rock reaction kinetics, gas generation and multiphase flow behaviour in natural hydrogen systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting tunable nonreciprocal spin wave generation mediated by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in magnonic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin, metallic magnetic films can support nonreciprocal spin waves due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). However, these films typically have high damping, making spin wave propagation distances short (less than one micrometer). In this work, we theoretically study a thin ferromagnetic strip with iDMI and excite spin waves by driving a central segment of the strip. Spin waves propagate with different amplitudes to the left versus to the right from the driving region (i.e. nonreciprocity occurs) due to the iDMI. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion plus our micromagnetic simulations both show that changing the driving segment width, driving frequency and static applied field strength tunes the nonreciprocity. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion, using a so-called "overlap function" will allow researchers to predict conditions of maximum nonreciprocity, without the need for computational solvers. Moreover, to circumvent the issue of short propagation distances, we propose a geometry where iDMI is only present in the driving region and low-damping materials comprise the remainder of the strip. Our calculations show significant spin wave amplitudes over several microns from the excitation region.</description>

      <title>A Rapid-prototyping CMOS-RRAM Integration Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moore's law has long served the semiconductor industry as the driving force for producing ever-advancing electronics technologies. However, given the economic implications and technological challenges associated with the present semiconductor scaling constraints, a shift from a traditional more Moore approach to a beyond Moore paradigm is desirable for sustaining the current pace of innovation beyond the established development route. Resistive random-access memories (RRAM) are one such beyond Moore technology that offers many avenues for innovation, and when integrated with mature complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS), can extend CMOS capabilities in a scalable and power-efficient manner, both in terms of memory and computation. Nevertheless, as emerging and established technologies fuse, existing semiconductor-optimised manufacturing faces significant challenges, while the methodologies and complexities of integration are often not highlighted in depth, or overlooked at the expense of demonstrating the application-specific integrated-technologies. In this article, we focus on the integration, and detail a cost-effective, rapid-prototyping, and technology agnostic CMOS-RRAM integration strategy that employs hybridised wafer-level and multi-reticle processing techniques, supported by a systematic increased complexity approach. Leveraging the fact that CMOS technologies can be readily realised by taking advantage of mature front-end-of-line fabrication processes offered by semiconductor foundries, we establish an in-house RRAM development program that allows to combine fundamental material and device-level knowledge with custom-designed CMOS electronics. This approach utilises fully CMOS-compatible and transferable processes, ultimately enabling a seamless transition from research and development to volume production.</description>
