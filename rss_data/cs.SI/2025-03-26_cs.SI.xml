      <title>Representative Ranking for Deliberation in the Public Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online comment sections, such as those on news sites or social media, have the potential to foster informal public deliberation, However, this potential is often undermined by the frequency of toxic or low-quality exchanges that occur in these settings. To combat this, platforms increasingly leverage algorithmic ranking to facilitate higher-quality discussions, e.g., by using civility classifiers or forms of prosocial ranking. Yet, these interventions may also inadvertently reduce the visibility of legitimate viewpoints, undermining another key aspect of deliberation: representation of diverse views. We seek to remedy this problem by introducing guarantees of representation into these methods. In particular, we adopt the notion of justified representation (JR) from the social choice literature and incorporate a JR constraint into the comment ranking setting. We find that enforcing JR leads to greater inclusion of diverse viewpoints while still being compatible with optimizing for user engagement or other measures of conversational quality.</description>

      <title>Cluster Synchronization via Graph Laplacian Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost equitable partitions (AEPs) have been linked to cluster synchronization in oscillatory systems, providing a mathematical framework for understanding collective behavior. Using the spectral properties of AEPs, we can describe this synchronization behavior in terms of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors. Our results also shed light on transient hierarchical clustering as well as multi frequency clustering, and the conditions under which they can occur. Through our analysis we are able to relate dynamical clustering phenomena directly to network symmetry and community detection, joining the structural and functional notions of clustering in complex networks. This bridges a crucial gap between static network topology and emergent dynamic behavior. Additionally, this description of the problem allows us to define a relaxation of an AEP we call a quasi-equitable partition (QEP). Perfect AEPs are rare in real-world networks since most have some degree of irregularity or noise. While relaxing these strict conditions, QEPs are able to maintain many of the useful properties allowing for qualitatively similar clustering behavior as with AEPs. Our findings have important implications for understanding synchronization patterns in real-world networks, from neural circuits to power grids.</description>

      <title>A Social Dynamical System for Twitter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of public opinion is crucial for informed decision-making in various domains, particularly public affairs. The rapid growth of social networks, such as Twitter (now rebranded as X), provides an unprecedented opportunity to analyze public opinion at scale without relying on traditional surveys. With the rise of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling online opinion dynamics. Notably, classical opinion dynamics models, such as DeGroot, can be reformulated within a GNN framework.
  We introduce Latent Social Dynamical System (LSDS), a novel framework for modeling the latent dynamics of social media users' opinions based on textual content. Since expressed opinions may not fully reflect underlying beliefs, LSDS first encodes post content into latent representations. It then leverages a GraphODE framework, using a GNN-based ODE function to predict future opinions. A decoder subsequently utilizes these predicted latent opinions to perform downstream tasks, such as interaction prediction, which serve as benchmarks for model evaluation. Our framework is highly flexible, supporting various opinion dynamic models as ODE functions, provided they can be adapted into a GNN-based form. It also accommodates different encoder architectures and is compatible with diverse downstream tasks.
  To validate our approach, we constructed dynamic datasets from Twitter data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LSDS, highlighting its potential for future applications. We plan to publicly release our dataset and code upon the publication of this paper.</description>

      <title>Reddit Rehab: User Migration in Response to Mobile Client Shutdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of Reddit users who re- lied on alternative mobile apps, such as Apollo and RiF, before and after their forced shutdown by Reddit on July 1, 2023. The announcement of the shutdown led many observers to predict significant negative consequences, such as mass migration away from the platform. Using data from January to November 2023, we analyze user engagement and migration rates for users of these alternative clients before and after the forced discontinuation of their apps. We find that 22% of alternative client users permanently left Reddit as a result, and 45% of the users who openly threatened to leave if the changes were enacted followed through with their threats. Overall, we find that the shutdown of third-party apps had no discernible impact on overall platform activity. While the preceding protests were severe, ultimately for most users the cost of switching to the official client was likely far less than the effort required to switch to an entirely different platform. Scientific attention has increased to understand the contributing factors and effects of migration between online platforms, but real-world examples with available data remain rare. Our study addresses this by examining a large-scale online migratory movement.</description>

      <title>Motif Counting in Complex Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motif counting plays a crucial role in understanding the structural properties of networks. By computing motif frequencies, researchers can draw key insights into the structural properties of the underlying network. As networks become increasingly complex, different graph models have been proposed, giving rise to diverse motif patterns. These variations introduce unique computational challenges that require specialized algorithms tailored to specific motifs within different graph structures. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of motif counting techniques across general graphs, heterogeneous graphs, and hypergraphs. We categorize existing algorithms according to their underlying computational strategies, emphasizing key similarities and distinctions. In addition to reviewing current methodologies, we examine their strengths, limitations, and computational trade-offs. Furthermore, we explore future directions in motif counting, including scalable implementations to improve efficiency in large-scale networks, algorithmic adaptations for dynamic, temporal, and attributed graphs, and deeper integration with large language models (LLMs) and graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG). By offering a detailed analysis of these approaches, this survey aims to support researchers and practitioners in advancing motif counting for increasingly complex network data.</description>

      <title>Can Invisible Psychological Traits Organize Visible Network Structure? A Complex Network Analysis of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator-Based Interaction Patterns in Anonymous Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration of the impact of personality traits on social interactions within anonymous online communities poses a challenge at the interface of networked social sciences and psychology. We analyze whether Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types impact the dynamics of interactions on an anonymous chat system with over 288,000 messages from 6,076 users. Using a data set including 940 users voluntarily providing MBTI typing and gender, we create a weighted undirected network and apply network-science measures-such as assortativity, centrality measures, and community detection with the Louvain algorithm-to estimate the level of personality-based homophily and heterophily. Contrary to previous observations in structured social settings, our research shows a dominance of heterophilous interactions (89.3%), particularly among cognitively complementary types, i.e., NT (Intuitive-Thinking) and NF (Intuitive-Feeling). However, there is a moderate level of personality-based homophily (10.7%), notably among introverted intuitive personalities (e.g., INTJ, INFP, INFJ), reflecting an underlying cognitive alignment that persists regardless of identity markers. The interaction network exhibits scale-free properties with a power-law exponent of 1.45. In contrast, gender is a stronger homophily attribute, as evidenced by stronger levels of female users' group interactions compared with male users. While MBTI type influences minor interaction preferences, community structure exhibits low modularity (Q = 0.2584). The findings indicate that, in the absence of identity cues, psychological traits subtly shape online behavior, blending exploratory heterophily with subtle homophilic inclinations.</description>

      <title>The impact of digital media-driven affective polarisation on epidemic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While prior studies have examined the influence of information diffusion on epidemic dynamics, the role of affective polarisation--driven by digital media usage--remains less understood. This study introduces a mathematical framework to quantify the interplay between affective polarisation and epidemic spread, revealing contrasting effects depending on transmission rates. The model demonstrates that greater digital media influence leads to increased polarisation. Notably, the results reveal opposing trends: a negative correlation between polarisation and the infected population is observed when transmission rates are low, whereas a positive correlation emerges in high-transmission scenarios. These findings provide a quantitative foundation for assessing how digital media-driven polarisation may exacerbate health crises, informing future public health strategies.</description>

      <title>Outsourcing an Information Operation: A Complete Dataset of Tenet Media's Podcasts on Rumble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tenet Media, a U.S.-based, right-wing media company, hired six established podcasters to create content related to U.S. politics and culture during the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle. After publishing content on YouTube and Rumble for nearly a year, Tenet Media was declared by the U.S. government to be funded entirely by Russia -- making it effectively an outsourced state-sponsored information operation (SSIO). We present a complete dataset of the 560 podcast videos published by the Tenet Media channel on the video-sharing platform Rumble between November 2023 and September 2024. Our dataset includes video metadata and user comments, as well as high-quality video transcriptions, representing over 300 hours of video content. This dataset provides researchers with material to study a Russian SSIO, and notably on Rumble, which is an understudied platform in SSIO scholarship.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Learning for the Identification of Risky Users in Dynamic Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technological progress in the last few decades has granted an increasing number of people access to social media platforms such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram. Consequently, the potential risks associated with these services have also risen due to users exploiting these services for malicious purposes. The platforms have tools capable of detecting and blocking dangerous users, but they primarily focus on the content posted by users and usually overlook additional factors, such as the relationships among users. Another key aspect to consider is that users' beliefs and interests evolve over time. Therefore, a user who can be considered safe at one moment might later become malicious, and vice versa. This work describes a novel approach to node classification in temporal graphs, aimed at classifying users in social networks. The method was evaluated on a real-world scenario and was compared to a state-of-the-art system that treats the network as a static entity. Experiments showed that taking into account the temporal evolution of the network, in terms of node features and connections, is beneficial.</description>

      <title>Disagreement as a way to study misinformation and its effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misinformation - false or misleading information - is considered a significant societal concern due to its associated "misinformation effects," such as political polarization, erosion of trust in institutions, problematic behavior, and public health challenges. However, the prevailing concept is misaligned with what is studied. While misinformation focuses on instances of information about factual matters, the broad spectrum of effects often manifests at a societal level and is shaped by a wide range of interdependent factors such as identity, values, opinions, epistemologies, and disagreements. Unsurprisingly, misinformation effects can occur without the prevalence of misinformation, and misinformation does not necessarily increase the effects studied. Here, we propose using disagreement - conflicting attitudes and beliefs between individuals and communities - as a way to study misinformation effects because it addresses the identified conceptual limitations of misinformation. Furthermore, unlike misinformation, disagreement does not require researchers to determine whether a given information is false or misleading. Thus, it can be studied and, more importantly, measured without the need to make a normative judgment about a given information, even when the specific topic is entirely removed, as we show in a longitudinal disagreement measurement. We demonstrate that disagreement, as a holistic concept, provides better explanations for the occurrence of misinformation effects, enhances precision in developing appropriate interventions, and offers a promising approach for evaluating them through quantification. Finally, we show how disagreement addresses current misinformation research questions and conclude with recommendations for research practice.</description>
