      <title>QED nuclear medium effects at EIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) nuclear medium effects under the experimental conditions of future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) experiments. Our work offers numerical estimates, particularly in the context of inclusive deep inelastic scattering on a $^{208}_{82}\mathrm{Pb}$ nucleus. While prior studies have predominantly focused on elastic scattering, our investigation extends to the more complex scenarios of inelastic processes within a nuclear medium. Our findings suggest that the cross-section corrections due to QED nuclear medium effects could be substantial, reaching or exceeding the level of experimental precision. This work further compares the effects of single re-scattering events with those of multiple re-scatterings, as particles travel the nuclear volume. We estimate the dominant source of the uncertainties associated with our formalism by varying the scale of the atomic physics where the screening of the electric field of the nucleus happens. This calculation not only contributes to the understanding of QED nuclear medium effects, but also offers a path to a more precise extraction of the process-independent non-perturbative structure of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole excitations near the neutron separation energies in $^{96}$Mo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric dipole strength near the neutron separation energy significantly impacts nuclear structure properties and astrophysical scenarios. These excitations are complex in nature and may involve the so-called pygmy dipole resonance (PDR). Transition densities play a crucial role in understanding the nature of nuclear excited states, including collective excitations, as well as in constructing transition potentials in DWBA or coupled-channels equations. In this work, we focus on electric dipole excitations in spherical molybdenum isotopes, particularly $^{96}$Mo, employing fully consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) and Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (QRPA) methods. We analyze the dipole strength near the neutron separation energy, which represents the threshold for neutron capture processes, and examine the isospin characteristics of PDR states through transition density calculations. Examination of proton and neutron transition densities reveals distinctive features of each dipole state, indicating their isoscalar and isovector nature. We observe that the primary component in the enhanced low-energy region exhibits isovector character. The PDR displays a mixture of isoscalar and isovector nature, distinguishing it from the isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR). These findings lay the groundwork for future investigations into the role of transition densities in reaction models and for their application to inelastic scattering calculations.</description>

      <title>$\alpha+\alpha+{}^{3}$He cluster structure in ${}^{11}$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\alpha + \alpha + {}^{3}$He cluster structure of ${}^{11}$C within the microscopic cluster model. The calculations essentially reproduce the energy spectra for both negative and positive parity states, particularly the $3/2_3^-$ state near the $\alpha+\alpha$+${}^{3}$He threshold. We also calculate the isoscalar monopole, electric quadrupole transition strengths, and root-mean-square radii for the low-lying states. These results suggest that the $3/2_3^-$, $1/2_2^-$, and $5/2_3^-$ states have a well-developed $\alpha + \alpha$ + ${}^{3}$He cluster structure. The analysis of the generator coordinate method wave functions indicates the dilute gaslike nature for the $3/2_3^-$, $1/2_2^-$, and $5/2_3^-$ states, suggesting that they could be candidates for the Hoyle-analog state. Furthermore, it is found that the $5/2_2^+$ and $5/2_3^+$ states may possess a linear chain structure.</description>

      <title>Moments of inertia of rare-earth nuclei and the nuclear time-odd mean fields within exact solutions of the adiabatic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically analyse the nuclear moments of inertia determined within the Skyrme and Gogny density-functional theories. The time-odd mean fields generated by collective rotation are self-consistently determined by an exact iterative solution of the adiabatic time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (ATDHFB) equations. Although details of the results depend on the functional used, the calculated moments of inertia are in good overall agreement with the experimental data, with no adjustable parameters. To show the essential importance of the time-odd mean fields, the ATDHFB moments of inertia are compared with those obtained from the Inglis-Belyaev formula. For Skyrme density functionals, we find strong correlations between the effective mass and the impact of the time-odd mean fields on inertia's rotational and vibrational moments.</description>

      <title>Finite- and infinite-volume study of $DD\pi$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for extracting the pole position and properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{\rm cc}^+(3875)$ from lattice QCD data using the relativistic three-particle formalism. This approach incorporates the effect of the one-pion exchange diagram in $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering, making it applicable at energies coinciding with the left-hand cut in the partial-wave projected $DD^*$ amplitude. We present an example application of this framework to existing lattice QCD data at $m_\pi = 280$ MeV. We solve the integral equations describing the $DD\pi$ reaction, use LSZ reduction to determine the corresponding $DD^*$ amplitude, and find the values of the infinite-volume two- and three-body $K$ matrices that lead to agreement with lattice $DD^*$ phase shifts within their uncertainties. Using these $K$ matrices in the three-particle quantization condition, we describe the finite-volume $DD^*$ spectrum and find good agreement with the lattice QCD energies. Our results suggest that, at this pion mass, the tetraquark appears as a pair of subthreshold complex poles whose precise location strongly depends on the value of the $DD\pi$ three-particle $K$ matrix.</description>

      <title>Strangeness in the proton from W+charm production and SIDIS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a global QCD analysis of unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the proton, including new $W$+charm production data from $pp$ collisions at the LHC, which have been suggested for constraining the strange quark PDF. In particular, we assess the impact of the $W$+charm data relative to that of semi-inclusive pion and kaon production data in lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering. Compared with a baseline global fit that does not include these datasets, we find that semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering and $W$+charm data combined favor a larger strange distribution, but smaller than the SU(3) symmetric sea suggested in some previous analyses. Combined, the ratio of strange to nonstrange sea quark distributions is $R_s = (s+\bar s)/(\bar u+\bar d) \approx \{ 0.69,\, 0.49,\, 0.29 \}$ for $x = \{ 0.01,\, 0.04,\, 0.1 \}$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inferring Nucleon's Gravitation Form Factors via Near-threshold $J/\psi$ Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With Bayesian inference, we investigate the impact of recent near-threshold $J/\psi$ production measurements by the $J/\psi$ 007 experiment and GlueX collaboration on the extraction of proton's gravitational form factors. We apply the generalized parton distribution framework at the next-to-leading order and demonstrate a stable expansion for the near-threshold kinematics. We find that the experimental constraints are in good agreement with the state-of-the-art lattice simulations, where negative $C_q(t)$ and $C_g(t)$ are strongly preferred. This highlights a great potential to extract them from future high-precision experiments.</description>
