      <title>Anomalous localization of light in one-dimensional L\'evy photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of coherent propagating waves has been extensively studied over the years, primarily in homogeneous random media. However, significantly less attention has been given to wave localization in inhomogeneous systems, where the standard picture of Anderson localization does not apply, as we demonstrate here. We fabricate photonic lattices with inhomogeneous disorder, modeled by heavy-tailed $\alpha$-stable distributions, and measure the output light intensity profiles. We demonstrate that the spatial localization of light is described by a stretched exponential function, with a stretching parameter $\alpha$, and an asymmetric localized profile with respect to the excitation site. We support our experimental and theoretical findings with extensive tight-binding simulations.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of fluid mercury across the metal-nonmetal transition: Ab initio simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an ab initio molecular dynamics study of fluid mercury at temperature 1750 K in the range of densities 7-13.5 g/cm$^3$. Along this isothermal line we performed an analysis of total charge fluctuations, which make evidence of neutral atom-like screening in fluid Hg for densities less than 9.25 g/cm$^3$, which practically coincides with the emergence of the gap in electronic density of states. High-frequency shear modulus, high-frequency and adiabatic speeds of sound, shear viscosity, Maxwell relaxation time and dispersion of collective excitations are analyzed as a function of density along the isothermal line.</description>

      <title>Sequential Dynamics in Ising Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first exact asymptotic characterization of sequential dynamics for a broad class of local update algorithms on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model with Ising spins. Focusing on dynamics implemented via systematic scan -- encompassing Glauber updates at any temperature -- we analyze the regime where the number of spin updates scales linearly with system size. Our main result provides a description of the spin-field trajectories as the unique solution to a system of integro-difference equations derived via Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) applied to a novel block approximation. This framework captures the time evolution of macroscopic observables such as energy and overlap, and is numerically tractable. Our equations serve as a discrete-spin sequential-update analogue of the celebrated Cugliandolo-Kurchan equations for spherical spin glasses, resolving a long-standing gap in the theory of Ising spin glass dynamics. Beyond their intrinsic theoretical interest, our results establish a foundation for analyzing a wide variety of asynchronous dynamics on the hypercube and offer new avenues for studying algorithmic limitations of local heuristics in disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Aging of amorphous materials under cyclic strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous materials driven away from equilibrium display a diverse repertoire of complex, history-dependent behaviors. One striking feature is a failure to return to equilibrium after an abrupt change in otherwise static external conditions. Instead, amorphous materials often exhibit physical aging: an ever-slowing, nonexponential relaxation that can span a huge range of timescales. Here we examine the aging behavior of three different amorphous materials subjected to slow periodic driving. The results reveal a generic aging phenomenon characterized by a logarithmic decay of dissipation per cycle. This observation is evaluated against several mesoscopic models of amorphous matter that successfully capture aging under static conditions: (i) a collection of noninteracting relaxation processes (ii) a noisy hysteron model with random pairwise interactions, and (iii) a structural model consisting of a random network of bi-stable elastic bonds. We find that only the latter model reproduces all experimental findings and relate its success to its persistent, slow exploration of a complex energy landscape with clear signatures of replica symmetry breaking. Thus, cyclic driving emerges as a simple yet powerful protocol to characterize amorphous materials, probe their complex energy landscapes, and distinguish between different models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm Software for Condensed Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the evolving landscape of quantum algorithm software specifically tailored for condensed matter physics. It examines fundamental quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Annealing (QA), Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as applied to key condensed matter problems including strongly correlated systems, topological phases, and quantum magnetism. This review details leading software development kits (SDKs) like Qiskit, Cirq, PennyLane, and Q\#, and profiles key academic, commercial, and governmental initiatives driving innovation in this domain. Furthermore, it assesses current challenges, including hardware limitations, algorithmic scalability, and error mitigation, and explores future trajectories, anticipating new algorithmic breakthroughs, software enhancements, and the impact of next-generation quantum hardware. The central theme emphasizes the critical role of a co-design approach, where algorithms, software, and hardware evolve in tandem, and highlights the necessity of standardized benchmarks to accelerate progress towards leveraging quantum computation for transformative discoveries in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Interpolations for a quantum Parisi formula in transverse field mean-field spin glass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum Parisi formula for the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is proven with an elementary mathematical method. First, a self-overlap corrected quantum model of the transverse field SK model is represented in terms of the Hamiltonian with annealed random interactions. The interpolation given by Guerra and Toninelli is extended to the self-overlap corrected quantum model. It is proven that the infinite-volume limit of the free energy density exists in the operator formalism. Next, another interpolation developed by Guerra and Talagrand is applied to obtain a finite step replica-symmetry breaking (RSB) bound on the free energy density in the transverse field SK model. The interpolation enables us to show that the deviation of the RSB solution from the exact solution vanishes in the self-overlap corrected quantum model in a functional representation of the quantum spin operators. Finally, the corrected terms are removed by the Hopf-Lax formula for a nonlinear partial differential equation to show the quantum Parisi formula for the original transverse field SK model. The formula is extended to that for the transverse field mean-field $p$-spin glass model.</description>

      <title>Latent geometry emerging from network-driven processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding network functionality requires integrating structure and dynamics, and emergent latent geometry induced by network-driven processes captures the low-dimensional spaces governing this interplay. Here, we focus on generative-model-based approaches, distinguishing two reconstruction classes: fixed-time methods, which infer geometry at specific temporal scales (e.g., equilibrium), and multi-scale methods, which integrate dynamics across near- and far-from-equilibrium scales. Over the past decade, these models have revealed functional organization in biological, social, and technological networks.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon couplings in locally disordered materials: The case of hybrid halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positional polymorphism in solids refers to distributions of correlated locally disordered unit cells which reflect, on average, the high-symmetry structure observed in diffraction experiments. The standard theory of electron-phonon interactions is unable to account for the temperature-dependent electronic structure of polymorphous materials. A prime example of such materials is hybrid halide perovskites, for which calculations of band gaps at finite temperatures do not agree with experiment. Here, we develop a systematic and accurate methodology to investigate electron-phonon couplings in complex polymorphous materials, demonstrated through calculations of anharmonic phonons and thermally-induced band gap renormalization for a broad family of halide perovskites. Our approach delivers unprecedented agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Discrete-space and -time analogue of a super-diffusive fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how to construct reliably well "a lattice and an integer time" version of a super-diffusive continuous-space and -time fractional Brownian motion (fBm) -- an experimentally-relevant non-Markovian Gaussian stochastic process with an everlasting power-law memory on the time-evolution of thermal noises extending over the entire past. We propose two algorithms, which are both validated by extensive numerical simulations showing that the ensuing lattice random walks have not only the same power-law covariance function as the standard fBm, but also individual trajectories follow those of the super-diffusive fBm. Finding a lattice and an integer time analogue of a sub-diffusion fBm, which is an anti-persistent process, remains a challenging open problem. Our results also clarify the relevant difference between sub-diffusive and super-diffusive fBm, that are frequently seen as two very analogous realizations of processes with memory. They are indeed substantially different.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investigation of water's glass transition and a possible liquid-liquid transition within its supercooled state is hampered by its inevitable crystallization in a temperature range, termed "no-man's land". Here we report dielectric-spectroscopy and calorimetry measurements of pure water and various aqueous LiCl solutions, part of the latter being quenched to avoid crystallization. By investigating solutions of relatively low salt content and by covering an exceptionally broad frequency range up to THz, we find strong hints at a crossover in water from a strong to a fragile liquid, characterized by different glass-transition temperatures and different non-Arrhenius temperature dependences of the molecular dynamics.</description>
