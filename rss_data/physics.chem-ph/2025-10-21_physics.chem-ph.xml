      <title>Space charge and ion transport in aerosol neutralization: Toward a concentration-dependent alternative to the $N_it$ product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we quantify how charged particle concentration affects the neutralization rate of aerosol particles, focusing on the role of ion dynamics shaped by internal electric fields arising from net space charge. Conventional neutralizer performance is typically evaluated using the $N_it$ product, which assumes quasi-neutral conditions and neglects electric fields from small charge imbalances. We demonstrate that internal electric fields become increasingly important at high aerosol concentrations and significantly influence neutralization dynamics. We develop a coupled ion--aerosol transport model in a two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry that includes ion generation, convection, diffusion, recombination, attachment to aerosols, and wall loss, with self-consistent electric fields obtained from the Poisson equation. Results show that even small net charges generate electric fields that enhance ion drift and accelerate neutralization, effects not captured by traditional $N_it$-based approaches. Using a neutralization time metric, we find that neutralization becomes slower with increasing aerosol number concentration $N_p$, higher initial particle charge $q_0$, and smaller particle diameter $d_p$ when space charge is absent. When space charge is included, the influence of $q_0$ and $d_p$ diminishes, while $N_p$ becomes the dominant factor governing neutralization behavior. Accordingly, we propose a concentration-dependent analytical expression for mean charge relaxation that captures coupled ion--aerosol transport and space charge effects. The modeling framework presented here is applicable to laboratory instruments, industrial processes, and atmospheric environments where electrostatic interactions govern aerosol behavior.</description>

      <title>Discovering How Ice Crystals Grow Using Neural ODE's and Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depositional ice growth is an important process for cirrus cloud evolution, but the physics of ice growth in atmospheric conditions is still poorly understood. One major challenge in constraining depositional ice growth models against observations is that the early growth rates of ice crystals cannot be directly observed, and proposed models require assumptions about the functional dependence of physical processes that are still highly uncertain. Neural ordinary differential equations (NODE's) are a recently developed machine learning method that can be used to learn the derivative of an unknown function. Here we use NODE's to learn the functional dependence of unknown physics in the depositional ice growth model by optimizing against experimental measurements of ice crystal mass. We find a functional form for the depositional ice growth model that best fits 290 mass time series of ice crystals grown in a levitation diffusion chamber. We use symbolic regression to derive an equation for the function learned by the NODE model, which includes additional terms proportional to ice crystal mass in the capacitance growth model. We evaluate this functional form against experimental data sets from the AIDA Aerosol and Cloud Chamber, finding that our new proposed model for depositional ice growth accurately reproduces experimental results in the early stages of ice crystal growth.</description>

      <title>Technomolecular Materials: 3D Printed 2D Nanosheets with Self Patterned Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our prior work, where our team transcended self assembled molecular monolayers (SAMs) research from a 2D configuration to 3D structured materials and successfully introduced the molecular self assembled 3D printer to fabricate technomolecular materials hybrid carbon metal nanosheets that mimic biological self assembly through cooperative organic inorganic interactions these materials promise advances in nanotechnology by enabling seamless integration of molecular systems with metallic electrodes. Here we show that electron beam irradiation induces direct self patterning of silver fractal nanoelectrodes on the technomolecular nanosheets, with formation influenced by molecular structure: saturated variants yield localized nanoparticles, while conjugated ones produce propagated fractals via electron delocalization and cross linking. In situ transmission electron microscopy reveals dynamic diffusion aggregation mechanisms, allowing controlled circuit patterns through resist free electron beam lithography. This approach advances flexible electronics, bioelectronics, and energy conversion, including fractal antennas and unclonable identifiers.</description>

      <title>Relativistic unitary coupled cluster method for ground-state molecular properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a relativistic unitary coupled cluster (UCC) expectation value approach for computing first-order properties of heavy-element systems. Both perturbative (UCC3) and non-perturbative (qUCC) commutator-based formulations are applied to evaluate ground-state properties, including the permanent dipole moment (PDM), magnetic hyperfine structure (HFS) constant, and electric field gradient (EFG). The results are compared with available experimental data and those from conventional coupled cluster (CC) calculations. The non-perturbative commutator-based approach truncated at the singles and doubles level (qUCCSD) exhibits markedly better agreement with both CCSD and experiment than the perturbative UCC3 method, likely due to its improved treatment of relaxation effects.</description>

      <title>Non-Resonant Raman Optical Activity As Explored Via Phase-Space Electronic Structure Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to model experimental non-resonant Raman optical activity, chemists must compute a host of second-order response tensors, (e.g. the electric-dipole magnetic-dipole polarizability) and their nuclear derivatives. While these response functions are almost always computed along vibrational modes within a Born-Oppenheimer (BO) framework, here we provide a natural interpretation of the electric-dipole magnetic-dipole polarizability within phase space electronic structure theory, a beyond-BO model whereby the electronic structure depends on nuclear momentum P in addition to nuclear position R. By coupling to nuclear momentum, phase space electronic structure theory is able to capture the asymmetric response of the electronic properties to an external field, in sofar as for a vibrating (non-stationary) molecule, the partial derivatives dmu/dB is not equal to dm/dF where mu and m are the electrical linear and magnetic dipoles, and F and B are electric and magnetic fields. As an example, for a prototypical methyloxirane molecule, we show that phase space electronic structure theory is able to deliver a reasonably good match with experimental results for a reasonable choice of gauge origin.</description>

Abstract: The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.</description>

      <title>MACE Foundation Models for Lattice Dynamics: A Benchmark Study on Double Halide Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in materials informatics and artificial intelligence has led to the emergence of foundational energy models for material chemistry, as represented by the suite of MACE-based foundation models, bringing a significant breakthrough in universal potentials for inorganic solids. As to all method developments in computational materials science, performance benchmarking against existing high-level data with focusing on specific applications, is critically needed to understand the limitations in the models, thus facilitating the ongoing improvements in the model development process, and occasionally, leading to significant conceptual leaps in materials theory. Here, using our own published DFT (Density Functional Theory) database of room-temperature dynamic stability and vibrational anharmonicity for $\sim2000$ cubic halide double perovskites, we benchmarked the performances of four different variants of the MACE foundation models for screening the dynamic stabilities of inorganic solids. Our analysis shows that, as anticipated, the model accuracy improves with more training data. The dynamic stabilities of weakly anharmonic materials (as predicted by DFT) are more accurately reproduced by the foundation model, than those highly anharmonic and dynamically unstable ones. The predominant source of error in predicting the dynamic stability arises predominantly from the amplification of errors in atomic forces when predicting the harmonic phonon properties through the computation of the Hessian matrix, less so is the contribution from possible differences in the range of the configurational spaces that are sampled by DFT and the foundation model in molecular dynamics. We hope that our present findings will stimulate future works towards more physics-inspired approaches in assessing the accuracy of foundation models for atomistic modelling.</description>

Abstract: Data restoration from degraded observations, of sparsity hypotheses, is an active field of study. Traditional iterative optimization methods are now complemented by deep learning techniques. The development of unfolded methods benefits from both families.

      <title>LOCAL: A Locality-based Active Learning Framework for Predicting the Stability of Dual-Atom Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-atom catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (DAC/NG) are emerging as a family of promising catalysts that can overcome intrinsic limitations of single-atom catalysts. However, comprehensive assessment of their structural stability is prohibitively demanding due to a vast local configurational space. Here we introduce LOCAL, a locality-based framework that combines graph convolutional networks with active learning to efficiently predict DAC/NG stability by leveraging chemically intuitive locality quantified by crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LOCAL over a comprehensive dataset of 611,648 DAC/NG structures, achieving a test mean absolute error of 0.15~eV while invoking density functional theory calculations for only 16,704 structures (2.7\% of the dataset). Thus, LOCAL enables efficient and accurate construction of phase diagrams for DAC/NG across diverse compositions reciprocally validated with experimentally synthesized configurations for representative systems. Our framework composes an essential methodology for accelerating the discovery and optimization of high-performance complex catalysts.</description>

      <title>An investigation into the nonconformity of homogeneous gas limit for kinetic energy density of atomic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing a reliable kinetic energy density functional within orbital-free density functional theory remains a long-standing challenge, particularly for atomic and molecular systems. A major difficulty lies in the absence of a systematic approach to accurately compute the kinetic energy density in such contexts. In our recent work, we introduced an analytical Green's function-based framework to address this issue. Majority of the existing efforts to construct an approximate kinetic energy density for atomic systems uses homogeneous electron gas as the bedrock of their formalism. In this work, we have shown by using a P\"oschl-Teller potential that for realistic atomic potentials such model yields improper results emphasizing the need to change the leading-order term for the quest of kinetic energy densities of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Instanton Theory for Nonadiabatic Tunneling through Near-Barrier Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many reactions in chemistry and biology involve multiple electronic states, rendering them nonadiabatic in nature. These reactions can be formally described using Fermi's golden rule (FGR) in the weak-coupling limit. Nonadiabatic instanton theory presents a semiclassical approximation to FGR, which is directly applicable to molecular systems. However, there are cases where the theory has not yet been formulated. For instance, in many real-world reactions including spin-crossover or proton-coupled electron transfer, the crossing occurs near a barrier on a diabatic state. This scenario gives rise to competing nonadiabatic reaction pathways, some of which involve tunneling through a diabatic barrier while simultaneously switching electronic states. To date, no rate theory is available for describing tunneling via these unconventional pathways. Here we extend instanton theory to model this class of processes, which we term the ``non-convex'' regime. Benchmark tests on model systems show that the rates predicted by instanton theory are in excellent agreement with quantum-mechanical FGR calculations. Furthermore, the method offers new insights into multi-step tunneling reactions and the competition between sequential and concerted nonadiabatic tunneling pathways.</description>

      <title>Quantum-selected configuration interaction with time-evolved state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum state on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in quantum chemistry) that define a subspace in which to diagonalize a target Hamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical computers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is crucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may suffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum device. Here, we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian (for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the intuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron excitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically investigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for quantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules. Numerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate ground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Systematic analysis when increasing the number of qubits in a hydrogen chain shows that the subspace size required for sufficiently accurate results is reasonable at system sizes that cannot be solved by naive classical diagonalization. Our proposal provides a systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI and could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers in quantum chemistry calculations.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian replica exchange augmented with diffusion-based generative models and importance sampling to assess biomolecular conformational basins and barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange with solute tempering (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.</description>

Abstract: Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies.</description>

Abstract: The atomic hydrogen anion H$^-$ is the lightest stable anion and its bound states and resonances are well studied in the literature. Due to the planned comparison of the bare antiproton to H$^-$ in a Penning trap, we study the magnetic shielding of H$^-$ using the nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, by accurately calculating the non-relativistic shielding, as well as finite nuclear mass, relativistic, and partially QED corrections. We find that the finite nuclear mass correction is quite significant in H$^-$ contributing about $0.1\%$ of the total shielding, which is more than twice as much as the relativistic correction. Our final result for the shielding constant has a nine-parts-per-trillion accuracy and paves the way for direct comparison of the antiproton-to-proton magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Coherent and Dynamic Small Polaron Delocalization in CuFeO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16222</link>

Abstract: Small polarons remain a significant bottleneck in the realization of efficient devices using transition metal oxides. Routes to engineer small polaron coupling to electronic states and lattice modes to control carrier localization remain unclear. Here, we measure the formation of small polarons in CuFeO$_{2}$ using transient extreme ultraviolet reflection spectroscopy and compare it to theoretical predictions in realistically parameterized Holstein models, demonstrating that polaron localization depends on its coupling to the high-frequency versus low-frequency components of the phonon bath. We measure that small polaron formation occurs on a comparable ~100 fs timescale to other Fe(III) compounds. After formation, a dynamic delocalization of the small polaron occurs through a coherent lattice expansion between Fe-O layers and charge-sharing with surrounding Fe(IV) states. Our simulations of polaron formation dynamics reveal that two major factors dictate polaron formation timescales: phonon density and reorganization energy distributions between acoustic and optical modes, matching experimental findings. Our work provides a detailed, real-time observation of how electronic-structural coupling in a polaron-host material can be leveraged to suppress polaronic effects for various applications.</description>
