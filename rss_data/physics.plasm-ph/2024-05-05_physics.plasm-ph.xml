      <title>The role of flow field dynamics in enhancing volatile organic compound conversion in a surface dielectric barrier discharge system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the correlation between flow fields induced by a surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) system and its application for the volatile organic compound (VOC) gas conversion process. As a benchmark molecule, the conversion of n-butane is monitored using flame ionization detectors, while the flow field is analysed using planar particle image velocimetry. Two individual setups are developed to facilitate both conversion measurement and investigation of induced fluid dynamics. Varying the gap distance between two SDBD electrode plates for three different n-butane mole fractions reveals local peaks in relative conversion around gap distances of 16 mm to 22 mm, indicating additional spatially dependent effects. The lowest n-butane mole fractions exhibit the highest relative conversion, while the highest n-butane mole fraction conversion yields the greatest number of converted molecules per unit time. Despite maintaining constant energy density, the relative conversion exhibits a gradual decrease with increasing distances. The results of the induced flow fields reveal distinct vortex structures at the top and bottom electrodes, which evolve in size and shape as the gap distances increase. These vortices exhibit gas velocity magnitudes approximately seven times higher than the applied external gas flow velocity. Vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy analyses provide insights into these structures' characteristics and their impact on gas mixing. A comparison of line profiles through the centre of the vortices shows peaks in the middle gap region for the same gap distances, correlating with the observed peaks in conversion. These findings demonstrate a correlation between induced flow dynamics and the gas conversion process, bridging plasma actuator studies with the domain of chemical plasma gas conversion.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Magnetized Asteroseismic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve for waves in a polytropic, stratified medium with a spatially varying background magnetic field that points along a horizontal $x$-direction, and with gravity that is directed along the vertical $z$-direction. Force balance determines the magnitude of the background magnetic field, $B_0^2 \sim z^{n+1}$, where $n$ is the polytropic index. Using numerical and asymptotic methods, we deduce an accurate and explicit dispersion relation for fast pressure-driven waves: $\Omega^2 \sim K\left(2m+n\right) \left[1 + (1/M_\mathrm{A})^2 (4-2\gamma+\cos^2\theta-3\cos^4\theta)/4 \right]$. Here, $\Omega$ is the frequency, $K$ the wavenumber, $\theta$ the angle the wave-vector makes with the background magnetic field, $M_\mathrm{A}$ the Alfv\'enic Mach number, and $m$ an integer representing the eigen state. Applications of our result are in magnetoseismology and nonlinear asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving the two-fluid plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-fluid plasma model has a wide range of timescales which must all be numerically resolved regardless of the timescale on which plasma dynamics occurs. The answer to solving numerically stiff systems is generally to utilize unconditionally stable implicit time advance methods. Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods have emerged as a powerful tool for solving stiff partial differential equations. The HDG framework combines the advantages of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, such as high-order accuracy and flexibility in handling mixed hyperbolic/parabolic PDEs with the advantage of classical continuous finite element methods for constructing small numerically stable global systems which can be solved implicitly. In this research we quantify the numerical stability conditions for the two-fluid equations and demonstrate how HDG can be used to avoid the strict stability requirements while maintaining high order accurate results.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal spectral transfers in fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by previous work on kinetic energy cascades in the ocean and atmosphere, we develop a spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool that can be used to study scales of variability in generalized dynamical systems. In particular, we use generalized time-frequency methods from signal analysis to broaden the applicability of frequency transfers from theoretical to practical applications such as the study of ocean or atmosphere data or simulation output. We also show that triad interactions in wavenumber used to study kinetic energy and enstrophy cascades can be generalized to study triad interactions in frequency or wavenumber-frequency. We study the effects of sweeping on the locality of frequency transfers and frequency triad interactions to better understand the locality of spatio-temporal frequency transfers. As an illustrative example, we use the spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool to study the results of a simulation of two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. This simulated fluid is forced at a well-defined wavenumber and frequency with dissipation occurring at both large and small scales, making this one of the first studies of "modulated turbulence" in two dimensions. Our results show that the spatio-temporal transfers we develop in this paper are robust to potential practical problems such as low sampling rates or nonstationarity in time series of interest. We anticipate that this method will be a useful tool in studying scales of spatio-temporal variability in a wide range of fluids applications as higher resolution data and simulations become more widely available.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Bayesian optimization for design of Pareto-optimal current drive profiles in STEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The safety factor profile is a key property in determining the stability of tokamak plasmas. To design the safety factor profile in the United Kingdom's proposed Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP), we apply multi-objective Bayesian optimisation to design electron-cyclotron heating profiles. Bayesian optimisation is an iterative machine learning technique that uses an uncertainty-aware predictive model to choose the next designs to evaluate based on the data gathered during optimisation. By taking a multi-objective approach, the optimiser generates sets of solutions that represent optimal tradeoffs between objectives, enabling decision makers to understand the compromises made in each design. The solutions from our method score higher than those generated in previous work by a genetic algorithm; however, the key result is that our method returns a purposefully diverse range of optimal solutions, providing more information to tokamak designers without incurring additional computational cost.</description>
