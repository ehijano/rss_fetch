      <title>Robust Market Making: To Quote, or not To Quote</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market making is a popular trading strategy, which aims to generate profit from the spread between the quotes posted at either side of the market. It has been shown that training market makers (MMs) with adversarial reinforcement learning allows to overcome the risks due to changing market conditions and to lead to robust performances. Prior work assumes, however, that MMs keep quoting throughout the trading process, but in practice this is not required, even for ``registered'' MMs (that only need to satisfy quoting ratios defined by the market rules). In this paper, we build on this line of work and enrich the strategy space of the MM by allowing to occasionally not quote or provide single-sided quotes. Towards this end, in addition to the MM agents that provide continuous bid-ask quotes, we have designed two new agents with increasingly richer action spaces. The first has the option to provide bid-ask quotes or refuse to quote. The second has the option to provide bid-ask quotes, refuse to quote, or only provide single-sided ask or bid quotes. We employ a model-driven approach to empirically compare the performance of the continuously quoting MM with the two agents above in various types of adversarial environments. We demonstrate how occasional refusal to provide bid-ask quotes improves returns and/or Sharpe ratios. The quoting ratios of well-trained MMs can basically meet any market requirements, reaching up to 99.9$\%$ in some cases.</description>

      <title>ARL-Based Multi-Action Market Making with Hawkes Processes and Variable Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advance market-making strategies by integrating Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (ARL), Hawkes Processes, and variable volatility levels while also expanding the action space available to market makers (MMs). To enhance the adaptability and robustness of these strategies -- which can quote always, quote only on one side of the market or not quote at all -- we shift from the commonly used Poisson process to the Hawkes process, which better captures real market dynamics and self-exciting behaviors. We then train and evaluate strategies under volatility levels of 2 and 200. Our findings show that the 4-action MM trained in a low-volatility environment effectively adapts to high-volatility conditions, maintaining stable performance and providing two-sided quotes at least 92\% of the time. This indicates that incorporating flexible quoting mechanisms and realistic market simulations significantly enhances the effectiveness of market-making strategies.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Dynamics of the Artificial Limit Order Book Stock Exchange with Autonomous Traders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the bifurcative dynamics of an artificial stock market exchange (ASME) with endogenous, myopic traders interacting through a limit order book (LOB). We showed that agent-based price dynamics possess intrinsic bistability, which is not a result of randomness but an emergent property of micro-level trading rules, where even identical initial conditions lead to qualitatively different long-run price equilibria: a deterministic zero-price state and a persistent positive-price equilibrium. The study also identifies a metastable region with elevated volatility between the basins of attraction and reveals distinct transient behaviors for trajectories converging to these equilibria. Furthermore, we observe that the system is neither entirely regular nor fully chaotic. By highlighting the emergence of divergent market outcomes from uniform beginnings, this work contributes a novel perspective on the inherent path dependence and complex dynamics of artificial stock markets.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of the Model-Free Valuation Approach: Hedging Gaps, Conservatism, and Trading Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the quality of model-free valuation approaches for financial derivatives by systematically evaluating the difference between model-free super-hedging strategies and the realized payoff of financial derivatives using historical option prices from several constituents of the S&amp;P 500 between 2018 and 2022.
  Our study allows in particular to describe the realized gap between payoff and model-free hedging strategy empirically so that we can quantify to which degree model-free approaches are overly conservative. Our results imply that the model-free hedging approach is only marginally more conservative than industry-standard models such as the Heston-model while being model-free at the same time.
  This finding, its statistical description and the model-independence of the hedging approach enable us to construct an explicit trading strategy which, as we demonstrate, can be profitably applied in financial markets, and additionally possesses the desirable feature with an explicit control of its downside risk due to its model-free construction preventing losses pathwise.</description>

      <title>Sizing the Risk: Kelly, VIX, and Hybrid Approaches in Put-Writing on Index Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines systematic put-writing strategies applied to S&amp;P 500 Index options, with a focus on position sizing as a key determinant of long-term performance. Despite the well-documented volatility risk premium, where implied volatility exceeds realized volatility, the practical implementation of short-dated volatility-selling strategies remains underdeveloped in the literature. This study evaluates three position sizing approaches: the Kelly criterion, VIX-based volatility regime scaling, and a novel hybrid method combining both. Using SPXW options with expirations from 0 to 5 days, the analysis explores a broad design space, including moneyness levels, volatility estimators, and memory horizons. Results show that ultra-short-dated, far out-of-the-money options deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. The hybrid sizing method consistently balances return generation with robust drawdown control, particularly under low-volatility conditions such as those seen in 2024. The study offers new insights into volatility harvesting, introducing a dynamic sizing framework that adapts to shifting market regimes. It also contributes practical guidance for constructing short-dated option strategies that are robust across market environments. These findings have direct applications for institutional investors seeking to enhance portfolio efficiency through systematic exposure to volatility premia.</description>

      <title>A Decoupled LOB Representation Framework for Multilevel Manipulation Detection with Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial markets are critical to global economic stability, yet trade-based manipulation (TBM) often undermines their fairness. Spoofing, a particularly deceptive TBM strategy, exhibits multilevel anomaly patterns that have not been adequately modeled. These patterns are usually concealed within the rich, hierarchical information of the Limit Order Book (LOB), which is challenging to leverage due to high dimensionality and noise. To address this, we propose a representation learning framework combining a cascaded LOB representation pipeline with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently improves detection performance across diverse models, with Transformer-based architectures achieving state-of-the-art results. In addition, we conduct systematic analyses and ablation studies to investigate multilevel anomalies and the contributions of key components, offering broader insights into representation learning and anomaly detection for complex sequential data. Our code will be released later at this URL.</description>
