      <title>Non-resonant SABRE provides a new and versatile hyperpolarization approach for magnetic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperpolarization approaches in magnetic resonance overcome the sensitivity limitations imposed by thermal magnetization and play an important role in a very wide range of modern applications. One of the newer strategies, variants of what is generically called SABRE, uses para-hydrogen to form hydrides on transition metal catalysts, followed by reversible exchange to polarize target molecules in solution, and has produced large signal enhancements (approx. 10^4) on hundreds of different molecules, cheaply and rapidly. Most commonly, the sample is kept in a constant field, matched to make the hydride scalar coupling comparable to the frequency difference between hydride protons and target protons (approx. 6.5 mT) or hydride protons and target heteronuclei (approx. 0.5 {\mu}T). Here we demonstrate a different strategy, applicable to a wide range of target molecules, that produces field-independent spin order in the target molecules that is efficiently converted to magnetization. The observed signal is even independent of field direction, hence significant polarization can be achieved in a sample on a lab bench with no field control at all. We show this signal arises from creation of two-spin order in the target molecules, and discuss multiple ways this strategy should expand SABRE generality and efficiency. We also show that, in many cases, the standard assumption in low-field SABRE of a starting state with only singlet polarization leads to incorrect results.</description>

      <title>Wetting Transparency of Graphene: Amacroscopic Window but Nanoscopic Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene supported on a substrate in contact with water underpins a wide range of processes and technologies, yet its wettability remains controversial. Understanding how substrate charges and graphene's properties influence water organization is crucial. Here, we combine heterodyne-detected sum-frequency generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate CaF$_2$-supported graphene interfaces in contact with water. We find that interfacial water orientation is primarily governed by the CaF$_2$ substrate's pH-dependent local electrostatics, confirming graphene's macroscopic wetting transparency. However, at the nanoscale, graphene's polarizability induces a local inversion of water's molecular orientation above substrate charges, revealing subtle structural ordering that is masked in spatially averaged measurements. These insights elucidate the molecular origins of graphene's wetting behavior and suggest new avenues to tailor interfacial phenomena in graphene-based nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Complex-Energy Second-Order Approximate Coupled-Cluster Methods for Electronic Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic resonances are metastable states with finite lifetimes, encountered in processes such as photodetachment, electron transmission, and Auger decay. Resonances appear in Hermitian quantum mechanics as increased density of states in the continuum rather than as discrete energy levels. To describe resonances accurately, including their coupling to the continuum, methods based on non-Hermitian quantum mechanics can be used, which yield complex energies. In this work, we combine the complex absorbing potential (CAP) and complex basis functions (CBF) techniques with the RI-CC2 method. The second-order coupled cluster method (CC2) offers a good balance between accuracy and computational cost by approximating equation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) theory, making it suitable for studying of electronic resonances in larger molecules. The resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation further reduces computational demands without significant loss in accuracy. We investigate the numerical performance of the new complex-energy RI-CC2 methods focusing on temporary anions. Negative electron affinities and decay widths can be computed using the electron-attachment (EA) variant of RI-CC2. For N2, C2H4, CH2O, and HCOOH, EA-CC2 yields affinities about 0.1-0.2 eV smaller than EOM-EA-CCSD, while deviations reach 0.5 eV for larger anions such as uracil, naphthalene, cyanonaphthalene, and pyrene. As a result of these trends, EA-CC2 is in better agreement with experiment for the negative electron affinities than EOM-EA-CCSD for all studied anions. The corresponding resonance widths from EA-CC2 calculations are about 0.05-0.25 eV smaller compared to EOM-EA-CCSD. Semi-empirical spin-scaling increases electron affinities by 0.3-0.5 eV and broadens resonance widths, improving the agreement with EOM-EA-CCSD but worsening the agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Fast and Scalable Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or large amounts of configurations, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as DFT. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires $3N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces, which is not negligible as the system size increases. This paper presents a way to replace the $3N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. This improves the computational cost and scalability of the method. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the corrected VMC forces with those obtained by the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are significantly biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values much closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Neural Network Performance and Interpretability of Quantum Wavefunction Probability Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting quantum wavefunction probability distributions is crucial for computational chemistry and materials science, yet machine learning (ML) models often face a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. This study compares Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) in modeling quantum probability distributions for the H$_{2}^+$ ion, leveraging data generated via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While ANN achieved superior accuracy (R$^2$ = 0.99 vs ANFIS's 0.95 with Gaussian membership functions), it required over 50x more parameters (2,305 vs 39-45). ANFIS, however, provided unique interpretability: its Gaussian membership functions encoded spatial electron localization near proton positions ($\mu = 1.2 A$), mirroring Born probability densities, while fuzzy rules reflected quantum superposition principles. Rules prioritizing the internuclear direction revealed the system's 1D symmetry, aligning with Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals theory--a novel data-driven perspective on orbital hybridization. Membership function variances ($\sigma$) further quantified electron delocalization trends, and peak prediction errors highlighted unresolved quantum cusps. The choice of functions critically impacted performance: Gaussian/Generalized Bell outperformed Sigmoid, with errors improving as training data increased, showing scalability. This study underscores the context-dependent value of ML: ANN for precision and ANFIS for interpretable, parameter-efficient approximations that link inputs to physical behavior. These findings advocate hybrid approaches in quantum simulations, balancing accuracy with explainability to accelerate discovery. Future work should extend ANFIS to multi-electron systems and integrate domain-specific constraints (e.g., kinetic energy terms), bridging data-driven models and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Spin covalent chemistry of carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review presents the covalent chemistry of carbon within the spin-radical concept of electron interaction. Using the language of valence bond trimodality, the regions of classical spinless covalence and its spin counterpart are defined. Carbon is the only element exhibiting spin covalent chemistry. Classical covalent chemistry of carbon concerns molecular substances whose valence bond structure includes segregate or chained single sp3C-C bonds. Substances with double sp2C-C and triple sp1C-C bonds are the subject of spin covalent chemistry of carbon. The mathematical apparatus of spin covalence forms the basis of algorithms governing the chemical modification of carbon substances, polymerization processes, and catalysis involving them, making it possible to supplement the empirical spin covalent chemistry of carbon with its virtual analog.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Unifies Foundational Machine-learned Interatomic Potential Architectures at ab initio Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that fine-tuning transforms foundational machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to achieve consistent, near-ab initio accuracy across diverse architectures. Benchmarking five leading MLIP frameworks (MACE, GRACE, SevenNet, MatterSim, and ORB) across seven chemically diverse compounds reveals that fine-tuning universally enhances force predictions by factors of 5-15 and improves energy accuracy by 2-4 orders of magnitude. The investigated models span both equivariant and invariant, as well as conservative and non-conservative, architectures. While general-purpose foundation models are robust, they exhibit architecture-dependent deviations from ab initio reference data; fine-tuning eliminates these discrepancies, enabling quantitatively accurate predictions of atomistic and structural properties. Using datasets constructed from equidistantly sampled frames of short ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories, fine-tuning reduces force errors by an order of magnitude and harmonizes performance across all architectures. These findings establish fine-tuning as a universal route to achieving system-specific predictive accuracy while preserving the computational efficiency of MLIPs. To promote widespread adoption, we introduce the aMACEing Toolkit, which provides a unified and reproducible interface for fine-tuning workflows across multiple MLIP frameworks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian learning for accurate and robust biomolecular force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics is a valuable tool to probe biological processes at the atomistic level - a resolution often elusive to experiments. However, the credibility of molecular models is limited by the accuracy of the underlying force field, which is often parametrized relying on ad hoc assumptions. To address this gap, we present a Bayesian framework for learning physically grounded parameters directly from ab initio molecular dynamics data. By representing both model parameters and data probabilistically, the framework yields interpretable, statistically rigorous models in which uncertainty and transferability emerge naturally from the learning process. This approach provides a transparent, data-driven foundation for developing predictive molecular models and enhances confidence in computational descriptions of biophysical systems. We demonstrate the method using 18 biologically relevant molecular fragments that capture key motifs in proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, and, as a proof of concept, apply it to calcium binding to troponin - a central event in cardiac regulation.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted design of chemically recyclable polymers for food packaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer packaging plays a crucial role in food preservation but poses major challenges in recycling and environmental persistence. To address the need for sustainable, high-performance alternatives, we employed a polymer informatics workflow to identify single- and multi-layer drop-in replacements for polymer-based packaging materials. Machine learning (ML) models, trained on carefully curated polymer datasets, predicted eight key properties across a library of approximately 7.4 million ring-opening polymerization (ROP) polymers generated by virtual forward synthesis (VFS). Candidates were prioritized by the enthalpy of polymerization, a critical metric for chemical recyclability. This screening yielded thousands of promising candidates, demonstrating the feasibility of replacing diverse packaging architectures. We then experimentally validated poly(p-dioxanone) (poly-PDO), an existing ROP polymer whose barrier performance had not been previously reported. Validation showed that poly-PDO exhibits strong water barrier performance, mechanical and thermal properties consistent with predictions, and excellent chemical recyclability (95% monomer recovery), thereby meeting the design targets and underscoring its potential for sustainable packaging. These findings highlight the power of informatics-driven approaches to accelerate the discovery of sustainable polymers by uncovering opportunities in both existing and novel chemistries.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the Hidden Symmetry in the Asymmetric Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of an asymmetric term into the quantum Rabi model generally lifts energy-level degeneracies. However, when the asymmetry parameter takes specific multiples of the bosonic mode frequency, level degeneracies reappear$-$a phenomenon referred to as the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model. Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system. Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the ratio between the two-level splitting $\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\omega$ satisfies $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states. Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime where $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$.</description>

      <title>Representational power of selected neural network quantum states in second quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network quantum states emerge as a promising tool for solving quantum many-body problems. However, its successes and limitations are still not well-understood in particular for Fermions with complex sign structures. Based on our recent work [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 21, 10252-10262 (2025)], we generalizes the restricted Boltzmann machine to a more general class of states for Fermions, formed by product of `neurons' and hence will be referred to as neuron product states (NPS). NPS builds correlation in a very different way, compared with the closely related correlator product states (CPS) [H. J. Changlani, et al. Phys. Rev. B, 80, 245116 (2009)], which use full-rank local correlators. In constrast, each correlator in NPS contains long-range correlations across all the sites, with its representational power constrained by the simple function form. We prove that products of such simple nonlocal correlators can approximate any wavefunction arbitrarily well under certain mild conditions on the form of activation functions. In addition, we also provide elementary proofs for the universal approximation capabilities of feedforward neural network (FNN) and neural network backflow (NNBF) in second quantization. Together, these results provide a deeper insight into the neural network representation of many-body wavefunctions in second quantization.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Fracture Nonreciprocity at the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal intrinsic fracture nonreciprocity, manifesting as directional asymmetry in crack resistance, in two-dimensional heterostructures engineered through lattice-mismatched interfaces. Density-functional theory combined with machine-learning molecular dynamics show that intrinsic lattice mismatch between bonded component crystals imprints asymmetric prestrain states at crack tips, governing bond-breaking thresholds through charge redistribution. The failure criterion obeys a universal exponential scaling law between normalized charge density and bond strain, insensitive to bonding chemistry and local atomic environment. The magnitude of nonreciprocity scales systematically with lattice mismatch, reaching 49% at 10% mismatch. Validation across hexagonal, square, rectangular, and oblique two-dimensional lattices confirms universality, establishing interface strain engineering as a general design principle that bridges electronic structure to nanoscale failure, enabling rational design of damage-tolerant nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive tip-enhanced sum frequency generation spectroscopy using temporally asymmetric pulse for detecting weak vibrational signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for investigating molecular structures, orientations, and dynamics at surfaces. However, its spatial resolution is fundamentally restricted to the micrometer scale by the optical diffraction limit. Tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) using a scanning tunneling microscope has been developed to overcome this limitation. The acquired spectra exhibit characteristic dips originating from vibrational responses located within the strong broadband non-resonant background (NRB), which distorts and obscures the molecular signals. By making the second pulse temporally asymmetric and introducing a controlled delay between the first and second laser pulses, the NRB was effectively suppressed, which in turn amplified the vibrational response through interference and facilitated the detection of weak vibrational signals. This interference also made the technique phase-sensitive, enabling the determination of absolute molecular orientations. Furthermore, forward- and backward-scattered signals were simultaneously detected, conclusively confirming that the observed signals originated from tip enhancement rather than far-field contributions. Finally, the signal enhancement factor in TE-SFG was estimated to be $6.3\times 10^6-1.3\times 10^7$, based on the experimental data. This phase-sensitive TE-SFG technique overcomes the optical diffraction limit and enables the investigation of molecular vibrations at surfaces with unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Open quantum-classical systems: A hybrid MASH master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method which combines the quantum-classical mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) with the dissipative quantum dynamics of the Lindblad master equation. Like conventional surface-hopping methods, our approach is based on classical trajectories coupled to the dynamics of a quantum subsystem. However, instead of evolving the subsystem wavefunction according to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, we use stochastic quantum trajectories derived from secular Redfield theory. This enables the simulation of open quantum systems coupled simultaneously to Markovian quantum baths and anharmonic non-Markovian classical degrees of freedom. Applications to the spin-boson model and to the cavity-enhanced fluorescence of an electronically nonadiabatic molecule show excellent agreement with fully quantum-mechanical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Directional Photocurrent Generated by Quantum Interference Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the absorption of light in a bulk homogeneous semiconductor produces photocarriers with non-zero momentum, it generally does not produce a current in the absence of an applied electric field because equal amounts of carriers with opposite momentum are injected. The interference of absorption processes, for example, between one-photon and two-photon absorption, can produce a current because constructive interference for carriers with one momentum can correspond to destructive interference for carriers with the opposite momentum. We show that for the interference between two-photon and three-photon absorption, the current has a narrower angular spread, i.e., a ``beam'' of electrons in a specified direction is produced in the semiconductor.</description>

      <title>Lithium Adsorbtion on Polyacenes $\&amp;$ Zig-zag-edge Graphene Strips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.09308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of increased electron-density (from adsorbed Li atoms) in polyacenes and in nano-ribbons with zig-zag edge is discussed in terms of resonance theoretical considerations and in terms edge-localized frontier molecular orbitals. The argumentation from simple pictures is finally using the density functional theory (DFT) for anthracene, polyacene polymer and graphene strips. Some discussion is made for zig-zag edge graphene.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonequilibrium distribution of large ions in charged small nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical research on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics has led to a remarkable discovery [2-4]: with a locally nonchaotic energy barrier, a macroscopic system may produce useful work in a cycle by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect, thereby breaking the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics. The mechanism is rooted in the intrinsic nonequilibrium steady state associated with local nonchaoticity. In the current investigation, we experimentally validate this concept, with the weak gravitational force in the "toy model" being changed to the strong Coulomb force. The tests are performed on a set of nanoporous carbon electrodes immersed in aqueous cesium pivalate solutions. The key characteristic is that the effective nanopore size is only slightly larger than the effective ion size, less than twice the ion size. At first glance, the supercapacitive cells exhibit "normal" charge curves. However, the steady-state distribution of the large ions in the charged small nanopores inherently differs from thermodynamic equilibrium, because of the confinement effect of the nanopore walls. The measured potential difference is nearly one order of magnitude larger than the upper limit calculated from the heat-engine statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Although counterintuitive, such a phenomenon is consistent with the molecular dynamics simulations in open literature.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>
