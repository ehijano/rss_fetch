      <title>Orbital splitter effect and spatial resolution of current-induced orbital accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of an orbital angular momentum (OAM) response to a charge current holds promise for technological applications, allowing electrical control of magnetization dynamics. Often, the OAM current is invoked in explaining experimental results for very large orbital transport effects, but this is conceptually challenging as the OAM current is not a conserved quantity. Instead of utilizing the orbital conductivity associated with the non-conserved OAM current, we here use non-equilibrium Green's functions to directly image the OAM density in real space under an applied electric current bias. We find strong spatial variations in OAM density, with the lattice acting as a source and sink of OAM. Moreover, we show that the OAM response depends sensitively on the angle between the charge current and the crystal axis. This enables the generation of an orbital Hall effect in one current direction and solely a longitudinal response in another. We refer to this as an orbital splitter effect, analogous to the spin splitter effect in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Topography of Fermi Arcs in t-PtBi$_2$ Using High Resolution Angle-resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic structure of trigonal phase ${\rm PtBi_2}$ (t-${\rm PtBi_2}$), a proposed Weyl semimetal that is expected to exhibit topological Fermi Arcs. Our ARPES data elucidates the topography of these objects and confirms their Fermi arc character. The arcs are formed by surface bands that have fairly flat bottom located very close to the chemical potential $\sim$ 6-8 meV, before they merge with bulk bands at higher binding energy. Comparison of the ARPES data with DFT calculations shows good agreement about their location and topography. Data acquired at low temperatures does not show any signatures of superconductivity down to 3 K in terms of expected changes in dispersion due to formation of Bogoliubov quasiparticles or superconducting gap in form of reliable shifts of peaks in energy distribution curves.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Interferometric single-shot parity measurement in InAs-Al hybrid devices", Microsoft Quantum, Nature 638, 651-655 (2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 'parity readout' of a (topological) superconductor claimed in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025). A prerequisite for this claim is the existence of a superconducting gap in the nanowire device. However, to determine the presence of a gap, Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) relied on the so-called topological gap protocol (TGP). Here, we show that the TGP can report the regions where the 'parity readout' occurred as either gapped or gapless, depending on data parameters such as magnetic field range and cutter pair (junction transparency). Compounding these issues are inaccuracies in the presented TGP outcomes, which limited investigation of reproducibility. Since these inconsistent outcomes demonstrate that the TGP is not a reliable diagnostic tool for the presence of a superconducting gap, we instead investigate the conductance data for the studied regions -- data that were not presented in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), but are in the public data repository. These conductance data show that the regions where 'parity readout' occurred are in fact highly disordered and present no clear gap in the nanowire, i.e., the underlying conductance data show that these regions are indeed gapless. That these regions are gapless contradicts the claim that the reported measurements are of the parity of a superconducting nanowire, let alone the parity of a topological superconducting nanowire. Taken together, these issues mean that the core findings in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) are not reliable and should be revisited.</description>

      <title>Excitonic bound states in the continuum in van der Waals heterostructure metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of excitonic quasi-bound states in the continuum in van der Waals heterostructures composed of two-dimensional excitonic layers and resonant dielectric metasurfaces. We begin our analysis with a simplified planar heterostructure slab model containing a vdW layer. We develop a theoretical framework based on the slab's Green function to describe the weak coupling between excitons and quasi-normal electromagnetic modes. We show that the exciton Purcell factor can be significantly suppressed when the exciton frequency matches a Fabry-P\'{e}rot mode and the vdW layer is positioned at the nodes of the mode's electric field. In this case, the suppression reaches its fundamental limit, which is defined exclusively by slab's permittivity. In heterostructure metasurfaces, a more substantial suppression can be achieved due to multiple interferences between Fabry-P\'{e}rot modes and guided-mode resonances with high quality factors. Numerical simulations confirm that the exciton radiative lifetime can be extended by over two orders of magnitude, demonstrating the formation of excitonic quasi-BICs and their potential for advancing quantum optics and information processing.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium mean-field approach for quantum transport with off-diagonal disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the nanoscale structures, disorder scattering plays a vital role in the carriers' transport, including electrons and high-frequency phonons. The capability for effectively treating the disorders, including both diagonal and off-diagonal disorders, is indispensable for quantum transport simulation of realistic device materials. In this work, we report a self-consistent nonequilibrium mean-field quantum transport approach, by combining the auxiliary coherent potential approximation (ACPA) and non-equilibrium Green's function method, for calculating the phonon transport through disordered material structures with the force-constant disorders (including the Anderson-type disorder). The nonequilibrium vertex correction (NVC) is derived in an extended local degree of freedom to account for both the multiple disorder scattering by force-constant disorder and the nonequilibrium quantum statistics. We have tested ACPA-NVC method with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem at the equilibrium and obtained very good agreement with supercell calculations for the phonon transmission. To demonstrate the applicability, we apply ACPA-NVC to calculate the thermal conductance for the disordered Ni/Pt interface, and important effects of force-constant disorder are revealed. ACPA-NVC method provides an effective quantum transport approach for simulating disordered nanoscale devices, and the generalization to simulate disordered nanoelectronic device is straightforward.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of angle-resolved electron reflection spectroscopy of few-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ab initio theory for electron reflection spectroscopy of few-layer graphene for arbitrary angles of incidence. The inelastic effects are included in a consistent way using the optical potential retrieved from ab initio simulations of electron energy-loss spectra. We demonstrate a significant impact of inelastic effects even for single-layer graphene. Next, we address the ability of the electron reflection spectroscopy to determine specific parameters of graphene including not only the number of layers in the few-layer graphene but also the stacking type in the graphene multilayers, and to resolve moir\'e patterns in twisted graphene bilayers. We show that the predicted contrast, although significantly reduced by inelastic effects, is sufficient for the experimental detection of all considered parameters. Our findings are corroborated by a fair correspondence of our theoretical predictions with experimental data, both our own and recently published by other authors.</description>

      <title>Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</description>

      <title>The Role of Quantum Vibronic Effects in the Spin Polarization of Charge Transport through Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between molecular vibrations and spin polarization in charge transport through molecular junctions is currently a topic of high interest, with important consequences for a variety of phenomena, such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this work, we follow this theme by exploring the relationship between vibronic dynamics and the corresponding spin polarization of the nonequilibrium charge current in a molecular junction. We employ the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach, which, since it is numerically exact and treats the vibrational degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, extends previous analyses of similar models that relied on approximate transport methods. We find significant spin polarization of the charge current in the off-resonant, low-voltage regime, where the vibrations must be treated quantum mechanically. Furthermore, we are able to connect the spin polarization in the charge transport to a corresponding polarization of the vibrational dynamics, which manifests itself in the vibrational angular momentum and excitation. Our analysis covers multiple molecule-lead couplings, temperatures, orbital energies, and spin-orbit couplings, demonstrating that the vibrationally assisted spin polarization is robust across a broad range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Ratchet motion of magnetic skyrmions driven by surface acoustic sawtooth waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of skyrmions by surface acoustic waves (SAW) has garnered significant interest in the field of spintronic devices. Previous studies established that skyrmions can be generated and moved by strain pulses. In this study, we propose that sawtooth-SAWs can be used to drive a ratchet motion of magnetic skyrmions in the presence of pinning centers. This results in a net motion of the skyrmions orthogonal to the continuously applied SAW. The ratchet motion is fundamentally caused by non-vanishing pinning, so that a certain strain gradient magnitude is required to overcome pinning and start skyrmion motion. We demonstrate the feasibility of our concept by micromagnetic simulations and analytical model calculations.</description>

      <title>Localisation of hexagonal boron nitride colour centres using patterned dielectric layers on graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising building blocks for the development of spin qubits, single-photon sources, and quantum sensors at room temperature, as well as 2D ultraviolet light-emitting diodes, are defect colour centres in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, a significant requirement for the realisation of such devices towards scalable technologies is the deterministic localisation of hBN colour centres. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to the localisation of hBN colour centre emission by using patterned dielectric layers grown on graphene via atomic layer deposition (ALD). While colour centre emission is quenched within areas where hBN is deposited directly on graphene due to charge transfer, it is maintained where hBN is deposited on micron-sized Al2O3 pillars which act as barriers to charge transfer. Importantly, our approach allows for device architectures where graphene layers are used as top and bottom electrodes for the application of vertical electric fields, such as for carrier injection in electroluminescent devices, Stark shifting of colour centre emission, and charge state control of defect colour centres. Furthermore, the use of ALD to grow dielectric layers directly on graphene allows for the control of tunnel barrier thicknesses with atomic layer precision, which is crucial for many of these device applications. Our work represents an important step towards the realisation of a wide range of scalable device applications based on the determinsitic localisation of electrically controlled hBN colour centres</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes review a description of quantum mechanics in terms of the topology of spaces, basing on the axioms of Topological Quantum Field Theory and path integral formalism. In this description quantum states and operators are encoded by the topology of spaces that are used as modules to build the quantum mechanical model, while expectation values and probabilities are given by topological invariants of spaces, knots and links. The notes focus on the specific way the topology encodes quantum mechanical features, or, equivalently, on how these features can be controlled through the topology. A topological classification of entanglement is discussed, as well as properties of entanglement entropy and basic quantum protocols. The primary aim is to build a less conventional diagrammatic intuition about quantum mechanics, expanding the paradigm of ``Quantum Picturalism".</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector rotation driven by spin-orbit torque in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin superfluidity, a phenomenon enabling low dissipative spin transport analogous to superfluidity in liquid helium and superconductivity in electronic systems, has remained a theoretical concept. To realize the spin superfluidity in an antiferromagnet, it is necessary to excite a N\'eel vector rotation within the magnetic easy-plane, which has been elusive so far. In this study, we demonstrated spin-orbit torque-driven N\'eel vector rotation in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo. A pseudo-magnetic easy-plane is formed in a spin-flop state under an external magnetic field at the vicinity of the magnetization compensation temperature, and we observed stochastic binary switching in the anomalous Hall resistance, directly attributed to N\'eel vector rotation. Furthermore, homodyne detection confirmed rotation frequencies in the GHz range as expected from atomic spin simulations, providing evidence of dynamic N\'eel vector behavior. These findings represent a crucial advance towards the realization of spin superfluidity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08989v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.</description>

      <title>Copper Vapor Catalyzing Role in the Growth of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cu is most used substrate to grow monolayer graphene under a temperature near melting point. In this study, we elaborated a remarkable amount of Cu clusters were continuously evaporated during the graphene growth, resulting into the vapor pressure comparable with the CH4. Importantly, the decomposition barrier of CH4 on Cu clusters is similar or even lower than on Cu surface. CuCH4 serves as the primary active cluster in complex intermediates, exhibiting a growth-promoting effect. Particularly after the first graphene layer coverage, it may emerge as a dominant catalytic factor for multilayer growth by supplying critical growth species. Through controlled seed incorporation, this mechanism is expected to enable large-area controllable growth of bilayer and multilayer graphene structures.</description>

However, there is currently a lack of reports on the non-trivial physics of topological degeneracy in twisted systems. In this work, we investigated the intrinsic physical correlation between twisting and topological degeneracy. We found that twisting not only breaks the symmetry of the system but also introduces topological degeneracy that does not exist under the original symmetric system without twisting. Furthermore, the topological degeneracy can be easily tuned through twisting. This new twist-induced topological degeneracy gives rise to a unique polarization-degenerate birefringent medium, wherein the twist angle acts as a novel degree of freedom for dispersion and polarization management of interface states. Exhibiting fascinating properties and experimental feasibilities, our work points to new possibilities in the research of various topological physics in twisted photonics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Optical Control of Multi-Valley States in 2D SnS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the ultrafast optical control of multiple valley states in two-dimensional (2D) tin sulfide (SnS) monolayers, a member of the layered group-IV monochalcogenides, which is a promising class of materials for overcoming current challenges in valleytronics. By combining time-dependent density functional theory with Maxwells equations, we simulate how both linearly and circularly polarized ultrashort laser pulses affect the electronic excitation dynamics and valley polarization in SnS. Our results reveal that the corrugated phosphorene-like crystal structure of SnS monolayers leads to the emergence of both linear and circular dichroism, allowing flexible manipulation of multi-valley excitation by simply adjusting the light polarization. Moreover, the interplay between broken inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling gives rise to distinct Berry curvature effects and spin-valley coupling, thereby enabling circular dichroism. Furthermore, we propose that tuning the carrier-envelope phase of few-cycle femtosecond laser pulses can achieve sub-cycle, ultrafast switching among multiple valleys states. These findings not only deepen our understanding of valley dynamics in 2D materials but may also open new avenues for the development of valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-Driven Interfacial Thermal Transport in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-plane thermal conductivity in homogeneous transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibits a strong dependence on twist angle, originating from atomic reconstruction within moir\'e superlattices. This reconstruction redistributes interlayer stacking modes, reducing high-efficiency thermal transport regions and softening the transverse acoustic phonon modes as the twist angle increases. We propose a general theoretical expression to capture this behavior, validated against non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations across both homo- and heterogeneous twisted TMDs structures, as well as homogeneous twisted graphene and hexagonal boron nitride stacks. Our model demonstrates that the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) scales with the twist angle ($\theta$) as $\ln{\left(\text{ITC}\right)} \propto e^{-\sqrt{\theta}}$. This mechanism, likely universal in van der Waals layered materials, highlights the potential of twist engineering for controlling interfacial thermal transport, offering new avenues for thermal management in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Linear Electro-Optic Effect Through Interactions of Free and Bound Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in non-Hermitian phenomena, particularly optical gain, stemming from electro-optic effects. Typically, these effects are attributed to nonlinear interactions arising from the ``anomalous velocity" of Bloch electrons. Here, we introduce a novel mechanism for achieving optical gain through nonlinear interactions between free and bound electrons. We propose a semiclassical phenomenological microscopic model that encompasses a broad spectrum of nonlinear interactions, consistent with passivity and with the principles of microscopic reversibility. Our analysis shows that under non-equilibrium conditions and within low-symmetry systems, the linearized electromagnetic response can display both nonreciprocal and gain properties. We examine the stability of these electrically-biased systems and illustrate their potential applications, including the development of optical isolators and traveling wave amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of a disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quenched disorder in a solid state system can result in Anderson localization where electrons are exponentially localized and the system behaves like an insulator. In this study, we investigate the effect of a DC electric field on Anderson localization. The study highlights the case of a one-dimensional insulator chain with on-site disorder when a DC electric field is applied throughout the chain. We study spectral properties of an Anderson localized system in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium using a full lattice nonequilibrium Green's function method in the steady-state limit. Tuning the disorder and the electric field strength results in the creation of exponential Lifshitz tails near the band edge by strongly localized levels. These Lifshtiz tails create effects like insulator-to-metal transitions and contribute to non-local hopping. The electric field causes gradual delocalization of the system and Anderson localization crossing over to Wannier Stark ladders at very strong fields. Our study makes a comparison with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) highlighting some major differences and similarities in the physics of disorder.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity altermagnetism through sublattice currents: From Haldane-Hubbard model to general bipartite lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in nonmagnetic crystal structures and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that macroscopically-normalizable zero-energy wavefunctions of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in a two-dimensional inhomogeneous magnetic field are spin-polarized and exactly calculable with degeneracy equaling the number of flux quanta linking the whole system. Extending this argument to massless Dirac fermions subjected to magnetic fields that have \textit{zero} net flux but are doubly periodic in real space, we show that there exist \textit{only two} Bloch-normalizable zero-energy eigenstates, one for each spin flavor. This result is immediately relevant to graphene multilayer systems subjected to doubly-periodic strain fields, which at low energies, enter the Hamiltonian as periodic pseudo-gauge vector potentials. Furthermore, we explore various related settings including nonlinearly-dispersing band structure models and systems with singly-periodic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Mirror Chern Bands and Weyl Nodal Loops in Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic spectra of altermagnets are a fertile ground for nontrivial topology due to the unique interplay between time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. This is reflected in the unconventional Zeeman splitting between bands of opposite spins, which emerges in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and displays nodes along high-symmetry directions. Here, we argue that even for a small SOC, the direction of the magnetic moments in the altermagnetic state has a profound impact on the electronic spectrum, enabling novel topological phenomena to appear. By investigating microscopic models for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) altermagnets, motivated in part by rutile materials, we demonstrate the emergence of hitherto unexplored Dirac crossings between bands of the same spin but opposite sublattices. The direction of the moments determines the fate of these crossings when the SOC is turned on. We focus on the case of out-of-plane moments, which forbid an anomalous Hall effect and thus ensure that no weak magnetization is triggered in the altermagnetic state. In the 2D model, the SOC gaps out the Dirac crossings, resulting in mirror Chern bands that enable the Quantum Spin Hall Effect and undergo a topological transition to trivial bands upon increasing the magnitude of the magnetic moment. On the other hand, in the 3D model the crossings persist even in the presence of SOC, forming Weyl nodal loops protected by mirror symmetry. Finally, we discuss possible ways to control these effects in altermagnetic material candidates.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytical formulation of the thermodynamics, free energy and entropy, of any generic Bogoliubov de Genes model which develops exceptional point (EP) bifurcations in its complex spectrum when coupled to reservoirs. We apply our formalism to a non-Hermitian Josephson junction where, despite recent claims, the supercurrent does not exhibit any divergences at EPs. The entropy, on the contrary, shows a universal jump of $1/2\log 2$ which can be linked to the emergence of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at EPs. Our method allows us to obtain precise analytical boundaries for the temperatures at which such Majorana entropy steps appear. We propose a generalized Maxwell relation linking supercurrents and entropy which could pave the way towards the direct experimental observation of such steps in e.g. quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>A charge transfer mechanism for optically addressable solid-state spin pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with no resolvable zero-field splitting has been observed from emitters in hexagonal boron nitride across a broad range of wavelengths, but so far an understanding of their microscopic structure and the physical origin of ODMR has been lacking. Here we perform comprehensive measurements and modelling of the spin-resolved photodynamics of ensembles and single emitters, and uncover a universal model that accounts, and provides an intuitive physical explanation, for all key experimental features. The model, inspired by the radical-pair mechanism from spin chemistry, assumes a pair of nearby point defects -- a primary optically active defect and a secondary defect. Charge transfer between the two defects creates a metastable weakly coupled spin pair with ODMR naturally arising from selection rules. Using first-principle calculations, we show that simple defect pairs made of common carbon defects provide a plausible microscopic explanation. Our optical-spin defect pair (OSDP) model resolves several previously open questions including the asymmetric envelope of the Rabi oscillations, the large variability in ODMR contrast amplitude and sign, and the wide spread in emission wavelength. It may also explain similar phenomena observed in other wide bandgap semiconductors such as GaN. The presented framework will be instrumental in guiding future theoretical and experimental efforts to study and engineer solid-state spin pairs.</description>

      <title>Effective K Valley Hamiltonian for Twisted TMDs which Exhibit Pressure Dependent Topological Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on topologically nontrivial moir\'{e} bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering untwisted bilayer systems with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy Hamiltonian valid near the important $\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the Brillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data was then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then could model a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.</description>

Abstract: We explore electrical transport through a point contact in strained HgTe, a three-dimensional topological insulator. In the absence of a magnetic field $B$, there is no quantization. However, under higher magnetic fields, we observe distinct non-integer conductance steps. Based on numerical tight-binding calculations and a phenomenological Landauer-B\"uttiker approach, we attribute these atypical, non-integer quantized plateaus to significant scattering effects at the point contact.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor InSb nanowires present a highly intriguing platform with immense potential for applications in spintronics and topological quantum devices. The narrow band gap exhibited by InSb allows for precise tuning of these nanowires, facilitating smooth transitions between the electron transport region and the hole transport region. In this study, we demonstrate quantum transport measurements obtained from a high-quality InSb nanowire quantum dot device. By utilizing a back gate, this device can be adjusted from an electron-populated quantum dot regime to a hole-populated one. Within both regimes, we have observed dozens of consecutive quantum levels without any charge rearrangement or impurity-induced interruptions. Our investigations in the electron transport regime have explored phenomena such as Coulomb blockade effect, Zeeman effect,and Kondo effect. Meanwhile, in the hole-transport regime, we have identified conductance peaks induced by lead states. Particularly, we have created a tomographic analysis method of these lead states by tracking the behavior of these conductance peaks across consecutive Coulomb diamond structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays an important role in the Hall effects. Unconventional spin Hall effect (USHE), characterized by Dresselhaus and out-of-plane spins, has been observed in materials with low crystal symmetry. Recently, antisymmetric planar Hall effect (APHE) was discovered in rutile RuO2 and IrO2 (101) thin films, which also exhibit low crystal symmetry. In this study, we report the observation of both USHE and APHE in IrO2 (111) films, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively. Notably, the unconventional spin torque efficiency from Dresselhaus spin was more than double that of a previous report. Additionally, the temperature dependence of APHE suggests that it arises from the Lorentz force, constrained by crystal symmetry. Symmetry analysis supports the coexistence of USHE and APHE and demonstrates that both originate from the crystal symmetry of IrO2 (111), paving the way for a deeper understanding of Hall effects and related physical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The generation of nonlinear spin photocurrents by circularly polarized light in two-dimensional systems is theoretically investigated by calculating the shift spin conductivities. In time-reversal symmetric systems, shift spin photocurrent can be generated under the irradiation of circularly polarized light , while the shift charge photoccurrent is forbidden by symmetry. We show that the $k$-cubic Rashba-Dresselhaus system, the $k$-cubic wurtzite system and Dirac surface states can support the shift spin photocurrent. By symmetry analysis, it is found that in the Rashba type spin-orbit coupled systems, mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent be parallel, which we name longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. The Dirac surface states with warping term exhibit mirror symmetry, similar to the Rashba type system, and support longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. In contrast, in the Dresselhaus type spin-orbit coupled systems, the parity-mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent be perpendicular, which we dub transverse shift spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we find that the shift spin photocurrent always vanishes in any $k$-linear spin-orbit coupled system unless the Zeeman coupling is turned on. We find that the splitting of degenerate energy bands due to Zeeman coupling $\mu_z$ causes the van Hove singularity. The resulting shift spin conductivity has a significant peak at optical frequency $\omega=2\mu_z/\hbar$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Polaron-Polariton Dispersion and Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Observation of increasing bending rigidity of graphene with temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of two-dimensional materials are important for a wide range of applications including composite and van der Waals-materials, flexible electronics and superconductivity. Several aspects are highly debated in the literature: For example, the theoretically predicted bending rigidity $\kappa$ at 0 K for quasi free-standing graphene varies from 0.8 to 1.6~eV, and there are predictions that it could either increase or decrease with temperature. Here we present an experimental study of the temperature-dependent bending rigidity $\kappa(T)$ of graphene. From the phonon dispersion relation measured with helium atom scattering for the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) mode, we find $\kappa(T)$ to increase with sample temperature. We compare our experimental results with novel molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed as part of this study as well as available literature data. The calculations reproduce the temperature trend of our experiments, but with a slightly weaker slope. A probable cause for the observed differences is the slight strain associated with experimental substrate supported graphene that is not present in the calculations.</description>

      <title>Space-time Supercrystals from Non-Abelian Electric Translation Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic supercrystals can form in spatial or temporal dimensions where traditional mechanisms usually require many-body interactions, such as Wigner crystals or discrete time crystals. We propose a novel approach for electronic supercrystals in 1+1D without requiring many-body interactions, but arising from the competition between characteristic space-time areas in periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices under electric fields. Utilizing the non-Abelian dynamical symmetries described by the electric translation group, the area competition is characterized by fractal spectra and replicated bands, furnished with eigenstates crystallized in enlarged space-time unit cells forming space-time supercrystals under perturbations. We also report robust dynamical localization of electrons arising from the static topology of the SSH lattice.</description>

      <title>Origin of $A$-type antiferromagnetism and chiral split magnons in altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the $A$-type antiferromagnetic ordering, characterized by ferromagnetic layers coupling antiferromagnetically, in the prototype semiconductor altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe has been a topic of ongoing debate. Experimentally, $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits an in-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas previous \emph{ab initio} calculations predicted an antiferromagnetic interaction. In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by considering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals a ferromagnetic in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is directionally dependent, inducing a nonrelativistic chiral splitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further show that applying a compressive strain may significantly enhance both nonrelativistic spin and chiral magnon splittings. The strain can also change the sign of the in-plane exchange interaction. Computing magnetic susceptibility, we show that strain enhances the N{\'e}el temperature, significantly. Our results highlight the critical importance of convergence in the number of magnetic configurations for spin interactions in antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Model validation and error attribution for a drifting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qubit performance is often reported in terms of a variety of single-value metrics, each providing a facet of the underlying noise mechanism limiting performance. However, the value of these metrics may drift over long time-scales, and reporting a single number for qubit performance fails to account for the low-frequency noise processes that give rise to this drift. In this work, we demonstrate how we can use the distribution of these values to validate or invalidate candidate noise models. We focus on the case of randomized benchmarking (RB), where typically a single error rate is reported but this error rate can drift over time when multiple passes of RB are performed. We show that using a statistical test as simple as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on the distribution of RB error rates can be used to rule out noise models, assuming the experiment is performed over a long enough time interval to capture relevant low frequency noise. With confidence in a noise model, we show how care must be exercised when performing error attribution using the distribution of drifting RB error rate.</description>
