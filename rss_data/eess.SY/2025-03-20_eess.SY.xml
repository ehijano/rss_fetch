      <title>Inductive Position Sensors based on Coupling of Coils on Printed Circuit Boards for Demanding Automotive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotor position feedback is required in many industrial and automotive applications, e.g. for field-oriented control of brushless motors. Traditionally, magnetic sensors, resolvers or optical encoders are used to measure the rotor position. However, advances in inductive sensing concepts enable a low-cost, high-precision position measurement principle which is robust against magnetic stray fields exceeding 4000 A/m. The operating principle is based on the coupling of a transmitter coil with several receiver coils in the megahertz frequency range. The coils are part of a printed circuit board (PCB) which also comprises circuitry for demodulation and signal processing. The transmitter coil induces eddy currents in an electrically conductive passive coupling element, which provides position-dependent amplitude modulation. The voltage induced in the receiver coils encodes the rotor angle information, typically in quadrature signals. The coupling element requires no rare-earth materials and can be made of stainless steel, for instance. The PCB-based design of the sensor offers considerable flexibility in optimizing its performance. By tailoring the coil geometry and arrangement, accuracy, air gap and overall sensor dimensions can be adjusted to meet a broad range of application-specific requirements. A sensor design sample exhibits a mechanical angle error less than 0.02{\deg} (0.1{\deg} electrical) in both, finite-element simulation and test bench measurement, with good agreement.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Cyberattack Detection-Isolation Algorithm for CAV Platoons Using SUMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoon in an evolving real-world driving environment relies strongly on accurate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for its safe and efficient operation. However, a cyberattack on this communication network can corrupt the appropriate control actions, tamper with system measurement, and drive the platoon to unsafe or undesired conditions. As a first step toward practicable resilience against such V2V-V2I attacks, in this paper, we implemented a unified V2V-V2I cyberattack detection scheme and a V2I isolation scheme for a CAV platoon under changing driving conditions in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The implemented algorithm utilizes vehicle-specific residual generators that are designed based on analytical disturbance-to-state stability, robustness, and sensitivity performance constraints. Our case studies include two driving scenarios where highway driving is simulated using the Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data and urban driving follows the benchmark EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). The results validate the applicability of the algorithm to ensure CAV cybersecurity and demonstrate the promising potential for practical test-bed implementation in the future.</description>

      <title>Controlling Peak Sharpness in Multimodal Biomolecular Systems via the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracellular biomolecular systems exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to low molecular copy numbers, leading to multimodal probability distributions that play a crucial role in probabilistic differentiation and cellular decision-making. Controlling the dispersion of multimodal probability distributions in biomolecular systems is critical for regulating stochastic behavior, robustness, and adaptability. However, modifying system parameters to adjust dispersion often affects peak positions, potentially altering a desired phenotype or even fundamental behavior in a genetic pathway. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that enables independent control of dispersion while preserving peak positions and modality using the Chemical Fokker-Planck Equation (CFPE) and sharpness, a measure of probability concentration around individual peaks. By analyzing the steady-state solution of the CFPE, we derive explicit conditions under which peak sharpness can be tuned monotonically without changing peak positions or modality. We validate our approach through Monte Carlo simulations on a bimodal chemical system, demonstrating effective dispersion control while maintaining structural stability. This framework provides a systematic approach for designing biomolecular systems with tunable stochastic properties, contributing to advancements in synthetic biology and probabilistic cellular regulation.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Planning of Power Distribution Systems Using Scalable Cloud Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty in distribution grid planning is driven by the unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in adopting electric vehicles (EVs) and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. This complexity, stemming from interactions among EVs, PV systems, customer behavior, and weather conditions, calls for a scalable framework to capture a full range of possible scenarios and analyze grid responses to factor in compound uncertainty. Although this process is challenging for many utilities today, the need to model numerous grid parameters as random variables and evaluate the impact on the system from many different perspectives will become increasingly essential to facilitate more strategic and well-informed planning investments. We present a scalable, stochastic-aware distribution system planning application that addresses these uncertainties by capturing spatial and temporal variability through a Markov model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations leveraging modular cloud-based architecture. The results demonstrate that 15,000 power flow scenarios generated from the Markov model are completed on the modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder, with each simulation representing an 8,760-hour time series run, all in under an hour. The grid impact extracted from this huge volume of simulated data provides insights into the spatial and temporal effects of adopted technology, highlighting that planning solely for average conditions is inadequate, while worst-case scenario planning may lead to prohibitive expenses.</description>

      <title>Defect Analysis and Built-In-Self-Test for Chiplet Interconnects in Fan-out Wafer-Level Packaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP) addresses the demand for higher interconnect densities by offering reduced form factor, improved signal integrity, and enhanced performance. However, FOWLP faces manufacturing challenges such as coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch, warpage, die shift, and post-molding protrusion, causing misalignment and bonding issues during redistribution layer (RDL) buildup. Moreover, the organic nature of the package exposes it to severe thermo-mechanical stresses during fabrication and operation. In order to address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive defect analysis and testing framework for FOWLP interconnects. We use Ansys Q3D to map defects to equivalent electrical circuit models and perform fault simulations to investigate the impacts of these defects on chiplet functionality. Additionally, we present a built-in self-test (BIST) architecture to detect stuck-at and bridging faults while accurately diagnosing the fault type and location. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed BIST solution and provide critical insights for optimizing design decisions in packages, balancing fault detection and diagnosis with the cost of testability insertion.</description>

      <title>Towards Connected Smart Work Zones: Advancing Work Zone Management through Improved Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work zones play a key role in road and highway maintenance but can lead to significant risks to both drivers and workers. Smart Work Zones (SWZs) have emerged as a potential solution, offering decision-makers real-time insights into the status of the work zone. By utilizing work zone barrels equipped with sensors and communication nodes, SWZs facilitate collecting and transmitting critical data, including location, traffic density, flow patterns, and worker proximity alerts. In collaboration with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), this study addresses work zone barrel connectivity requirements while considering a cost-effective, low-power, and low-maintenance solution. While the broader project aimed to create a complete SWZ system for the localization of work zone barrels, this paper proposes a novel relay node selection algorithm integrated with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to enhance network performance. The proposed algorithm enhances the communication network performance by selecting specific nodes as relay points, avoiding message flooding in the network. It demonstrates an improvement in message delivery rates, achieving up to a 40% increase over existing methods while ensuring balanced load distribution among nodes. Moreover, it maintains an 80% message delivery rate while minimizing power consumption, outperforming other approaches. This improvement in communication efficiency is critical, as it ensures the accurate transmission and delivery of vital work zone data, allowing for faster and more informed decisions to enhance work zone safety and management.</description>

      <title>On a Dissimilarity Metric for Analyzing Body Synergistic Coordination in Non-Periodic Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel metric to quantitatively evaluate body synergistic coordination, explicitly addressing dynamic interactions between pairs of body segments in baseball pitching motions. Conventional methods typically compare motion trajectories using individual joint coordinates or velocities independently, employing techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) that inherently apply temporal alignment even when such correction may distort meaningful rhythm-based differences. In contrast, our approach models the coordination dynamics as Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, leveraging convolution operations between pairs of time series data to capture the gain and phase-lag inherent in genuine coordination dynamics. Empirical validation demonstrates the robustness of the proposed metric to variations in camera angles and scaling, providing superior discriminative capability compared to DTW and deep learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>Design for Sensing and Digitalisation (DSD): A Modern Approach to Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Design for Sensing and Digitalisation (DSD), a new engineering design paradigm that integrates sensor technology for digitisation and digitalisation from the earliest stages of the design process. Unlike traditional methodologies that treat sensing as an afterthought, DSD emphasises sensor integration, signal path optimisation, and real-time data utilisation as core design principles. The paper outlines DSD's key principles, discusses its role in enabling digital twin technology, and argues for its importance in modern engineering education. By adopting DSD, engineers can create more intelligent and adaptable systems that leverage real-time data for continuous design iteration, operational optimisation and data-driven predictive maintenance.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Grid Data with Cyber Resilience and Privacy Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides a principled approach to synthesizing data (e.g., loads) from real-world power systems while limiting the exposure of sensitive information. However, adversaries may exploit synthetic data to calibrate cyberattacks on the source grids. To control these risks, we propose new DP algorithms for synthesizing data that provide the source grids with both cyber resilience and privacy guarantees. The algorithms incorporate both normal operation and attack optimization models to balance the fidelity of synthesized data and cyber resilience. The resulting post-processing optimization is reformulated as a robust optimization problem, which is compatible with the exponential mechanism of DP to moderate its computational burden.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fault Detection and Isolation in an All-Electric Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Gas Generator by Utilizing Starter/Generator Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel paradigm for enhancing fault detection and isolation (FDI) of gas generators in all-electric auxiliary power unit (APU) by utilizing shaft power information from the starter/generator. First, we conduct a pioneering investigation into the challenges and opportunities for FDI brought about by APU electrification. Our analysis reveals that the electrification of APU opens up new possibilities for utilizing shaft power estimates from starter/generator to improve gas generator FDI. We then provide comprehensive theoretical and analytical evidence demonstrating why, how, and to what extent, the shaft power information from the starter/generator can fundamentally enhance the estimation accuracy of system states and health parameters of the gas generator, while also identifying the key factors influencing these improvements in FDI performance. The effectiveness of the proposed paradigm and its theoretical foundations are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, through comprehensive comparative analysis with state-of-the-art gas generator fault diagnosis methods, our experimental results not only demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach but also validate that the diagnostic capabilities of existing advanced FDI techniques can be substantially enhanced by incorporating shaft power information. And the observed performance improvement patterns strongly align with our theoretical analysis, verifying both the effectiveness and guiding significance of our theoretical framework. These research findings provide a unique perspective in answering three fundamental questions: why joint fault diagnosis of the starter/generator and gas generator is essential, how it can be implemented, and what factors determine its effectiveness, thereby opening up promising new avenues for FDI technologies in all-electric APU systems.</description>

      <title>High-Order Control Barrier Functions: Insights and a Truncated Taylor-Based Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the complexity of the standard High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) approach and propose a truncated Taylor-based approach that reduces design parameters. First, we derive the explicit inequality condition for the HOCBF approach and show that the corresponding equality condition sets a lower bound on the barrier function value that regulates its decay rate. Next, we present our Truncated Taylor CBF (TTCBF), which uses a truncated Taylor series to approximate the discrete-time CBF condition. While the standard HOCBF approach requires multiple class K functions, leading to more design parameters as the constraint's relative degree increases, our TTCBF approach requires only one. We support our theoretical findings in numerical collision-avoidance experiments and show that our approach ensures safety while reducing design complexity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reset Control Phase with Lead Shaping Filters: Applications to Precision Motion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a shaped reset feedback control strategy to enhance the performance of precision motion systems. The approach utilizes a phase-lead compensator as a shaping filter to tune the phase of reset instants, thereby shaping the nonlinearity in the first-order reset control. {The design achieves either an increased phase margin while maintaining gain properties or improved gain without sacrificing phase margin, compared to reset control without the shaping filter.} Then, frequency-domain design procedures are provided for both Clegg Integrator (CI)-based and First-Order Reset Element (FORE)-based reset control systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through two experimental case studies on a precision motion stage. In the first case, the shaped reset control leverages phase-lead benefits to achieve zero overshoot in the transient response. In the second case, the shaped reset control strategy enhances the gain advantages of the previous reset element, resulting in improved steady-state performance, including better tracking precision and disturbance rejection, while reducing overshoot for an improved transient response.</description>

      <title>Automated Functional Decomposition for Hybrid Zonotope Over-approximations with Application to LSTM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional decomposition is a powerful tool for systems analysis because it can reduce a function of arbitrary input dimensions to the sum and superposition of functions of a single variable, thereby mitigating (or potentially avoiding) the exponential scaling often associated with analyses over high-dimensional spaces. This paper presents automated methods for constructing functional decompositions used to form set-based over-approximations of nonlinear functions, with particular focus on the hybrid zonotope set representation. To demonstrate these methods, we construct a hybrid zonotope set that over-approximates the input-output graph of a long short-term memory neural network, and use functional decomposition to represent a discrete hybrid automaton via a hybrid zonotope.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of Distributed Dispatching of Multiple Active Distribution Networks Using the ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the experimental validation of a framework for the coordinated dispatch and control of multiple active distribution networks (ADNs) hosting distributed energy resource (DER). We show that the presented method, which builds further on work done in [1], effectively allows to control multiple ADNs in a distributed way to ensure they achieve a common objective without revealing information on their DERs capabilities or grid model. This experimental validation is carried out using demonstrators at the DESL of EPFL and the NEST site at Empa, both in Switzerland. The coordination of the systems to share the flexibility of their controllable assets is demonstrated through a set of 24h experiments. Finally, the limitations of the method are discussed and future extensions proposed.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-Based Graph Neural Networks for Adaptive Control of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have a message-passing framework in which vector messages are exchanged between graph nodes and updated using feedforward layers. The inclusion of distributed message-passing in the GNN architecture makes them ideally suited for distributed control and coordination tasks. Existing results develop GNN-based controllers to address a variety of multi-agent control problems while compensating for modeling uncertainties in the systems. However, these results use GNNs that are pre-trained offline. This paper provides the first result on GNNs with stability-driven online weight updates to address the multi-agent target tracking problem. Specifically, new Lyapunov-based distributed GNN and graph attention network (GAT)-based controllers are developed to adaptively estimate unknown target dynamics and address the second-order target tracking problem. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee exponential convergence of the target state estimates and agent states to a neighborhood of the target state. Numerical simulations show a 20.8% and 48.1% position tracking error performance improvement by the GNN and GAT architectures over a baseline DNN architecture, respectively.</description>

      <title>Priority-driven Constraints Softening in Safe MPC for Perturbed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a safe model predictive control (SMPC) framework designed to ensure the satisfaction of hard constraints for systems perturbed by an external disturbance. Such safety guarantees are ensured, despite the disturbance, by online softening a subset of adjustable constraints defined by the designer. The selection of the constraints to be softened is made online based on a predefined priority assigned to each adjustable constraint. The design of a learning-based algorithm enables real-time computation while preserving the original safety properties.
  Simulations results, obtained from an automated driving application, show that the proposed approach provides guarantees of collision-avoidance hard constraints despite the unpredicted behaviors of the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Flexibility Aggregation of DERs for Ancillary Services Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a grid-aware probabilistic approach to compute the aggregated flexibility at the grid connection point (GCP) of active distribution networks (ADNs) to allow the participation of DERs in ancillary services (AS) markets. Specifically an optimal power flow (OPF) method using a linear network model is used to compute the aggregated capability for the provision of multiple AS. We start from the method proposed in [1] and extend it to allow for optimizing the provision of multiple services simultaneously, ensure cost-effectiveness of the used DERs and handle uncertainties in a probabilistic way. The allocation of individual DERs power flexibilities accounts for the operational costs associated to the provision of different services and ensures cost-effectiveness while maximizing the value of the advertised aggregated flexibility, assuming known service prices. Empirical uncertainty sets are obtained to achieve a predefined coverage of the probability distribution in line with recent developments in the Nordic AS markets. Finally, a feeder-decomposition approach is proposed to ensure the methods applicability to realistic distribution networks with a large number of buses. Different case studies show the effectiveness of the method, highlight the importance of accounting for network constraints and illustrate its applicability to realistic distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient Merging of Connected and Automated Vehicles using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highway merges present difficulties for human drivers and automated vehicles due to incomplete situational awareness and a need for a structured (precedence, order) environment, respectively. In this paper, an unstructured merge algorithm is presented for connected and automated vehicles. There is neither precedence nor established passing order through the merge point. The algorithm relies on Control Barrier Functions for safety (collision avoidance) and for coordination that arises from exponential instability of stall-equilibria in the inter-agent space. A Monte Carlo simulation comparison to a first-in-first-out approach shows improvement in traffic flow and a significant energy efficiency benefit.</description>

      <title>Advancing MG Energy Management: A Rolling Horizon Optimization Framework for Three-Phase Unbalanced Networks Integrating Convex Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world three-phase microgrids face two interconnected challenges: 1. time-varying uncertainty from renewable generation and demand, and 2. persistent phase imbalances caused by uneven distributed energy resources DERs, load asymmetries, and grid faults. Conventional energy management systems fail to address these challenges holistically and static optimization methods lack adaptability to real-time fluctuations, while balanced three-phase models ignore critical asymmetries that degrade voltage stability and efficiency. This work introduces a dynamic rolling horizon optimization framework specifically designed for unbalanced three-phase microgrids. Unlike traditional two-stage stochastic approaches that fix decisions for the entire horizon, the rolling horizon algorithm iteratively updates decisions in response to real-time data. By solving a sequence of shorter optimization windows, each incorporating the latest system state and forecasts, the method achieves three key advantages: Adaptive Uncertainty Handling by continuously re plans operations to mitigate forecast errors. Phase Imbalance Correction by dynamically adjusts power flows across phases to minimize voltage deviations and losses caused by asymmetries, and computational Tractability, i.e., shorter optimization windows, combined with the mathematical mhodel, enable better decision making holding accuracy. For comparison purposes, we derive three optimization models: a nonlinear nonconvex model for high-fidelity offline planning, a convex quadratic approximation for day-ahead scheduling, and a linearized model to important for theoretical reasons such as decomposition algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Prior Knowledge in Preferential Learning of Individualized Autonomous Vehicle Driving Styles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning for automated vehicles commonly employs optimization over a moving horizon - Model Predictive Control - where the cost function critically influences the resulting driving style. However, finding a suitable cost function that results in a driving style preferred by passengers remains an ongoing challenge. We employ preferential Bayesian optimization to learn the cost function by iteratively querying a passenger's preference. Due to increasing dimensionality of the parameter space, preference learning approaches might struggle to find a suitable optimum with a limited number of experiments and expose the passenger to discomfort when exploring the parameter space. We address these challenges by incorporating prior knowledge into the preferential Bayesian optimization framework. Our method constructs a virtual decision maker from real-world human driving data to guide parameter sampling. In a simulation experiment, we achieve faster convergence of the prior-knowledge-informed learning procedure compared to existing preferential Bayesian optimization approaches and reduce the number of inadequate driving styles sampled.</description>

      <title>The value of hedging against energy storage uncertainties when designing energy parks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy storage is needed to match renewable generation to industrial loads in energy parks. However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is currently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets, energy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in storage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during initial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design adaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the cost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly. This raises the question, "Is it worth it?"
  This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy park designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty reduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the Value of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and storage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal near Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and capital cost.
  Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce total costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology choice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater than the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies in the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality is not worthwhile. These results are robust to the level of uncertainty reduction in storage performance, and the risk aversion of the system designer.</description>

      <title>Value-Oriented Forecast Combinations for Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value-oriented forecasts for two-stage power system operational problems have been demonstrated to reduce cost, but prove to be computationally challenging for large-scale systems because the underlying optimization problem must be internalized into the forecast model training. Therefore, existing approaches typically scale poorly in the usable training data or require relaxations of the underlying optimization. This paper presents a method for value-oriented forecast combinations using progressive hedging, which unlocks high-fidelity, at-scale models and large-scale datasets in training. We also derive a direct one-shot training model for reference and study how different modifications of the training model impact the solution quality. Our method reduces operation cost by 1.8% on average and trains forecast combinations for a 2736-bus test system with one year of data within 20 hours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in Stochastic Optimal Control. It extends the continuous space, continuous time path Integral Diffusion sampling technique to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network framework. In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model, discuss potential NN based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction and Navigability of Multiplex Energy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern energy networks, where operational efficiency and resilience are critical, this study introduces an in-depth analysis from a multiplex network perspective - defined as a network where multiple types of connections exist between the same set of nodes. Utilizing Belgium's electricity and gas networks, we construct a five-layer multiplex network to simulate random node shutdown scenarios. We tailored the Jaccard and Adamic-Adar link prediction algorithms by integrating the concept of exclusive neighbors, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy with such multi-layered information. Emphasizing navigability, i.e., the network's ability to maintain resilience and efficiency under random failures, we analyze the impact of different random walk strategies and strategic link additions at various stages - individual layers, two-layer combinations, and three-layer combinations - on the network's navigability. Directed networks show modest improvements with new links, partly due to trapping effects, where a random walker can become circumscribed within certain network loops, limiting reachability across the network. In contrast, the undirected networks demonstrate notable increases in navigability with new link additions. Spectral gap analysis in directed networks indicates that new link additions can aid and impede navigability, depending on their configuration. This study deepens our understanding of multiplex energy network navigability and highlights the importance of strategic link additions influenced by random walk strategies in these networks.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Neuroadaptive Control of Robotic Manipulators under Deferred Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based neuroadaptive control framework for robotic manipulators operating under deferred constraints. The proposed approach improves traditional barrier Lyapunov functions by introducing a smooth constraint enforcement mechanism that offers two key advantages: (i) it minimizes control effort in unconstrained regions and progressively increases it near constraints, improving energy efficiency, and (ii) it enables gradual constraint activation through a prescribed-time shifting function, allowing safe operation even when initial conditions violate constraints. To address system uncertainties and improve adaptability, an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework is employed. The critic network estimates the value function, while the actor network learns an optimal control policy in real time, enabling adaptive constraint handling without requiring explicit system modeling. Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees the boundedness of all closed-loop signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous parking control system for an active-joint center-articulated mobile robot. We begin by proposing a kinematic model of the robot, then derive a control law designed to stabilize the vehicle's configuration within a small neighborhood of the target position. The control law is developed using Lyapunov techniques and is based on the robot's equations of motion in polar coordinates. Additionally, a beacon-based guidance system provides real-time feedback on the target's position and orientation. Simulation results demonstrate the robot's capability to start from arbitrary initial positions and orientations and successfully achieve parking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is motivated by the development of cooperative teams of small, soft underwater robots designed to accomplish complex tasks through collective behavior. These robots take inspiration from biology: salps are gelatinous, jellyfish-like marine animals that utilize jet propulsion for maneuvering and can physically connect to form dynamic chains of arbitrary shape and size. The primary contributions of this research are twofold: first, we adapt a planar nonlinear multi-link snake robot model to model a planar multi-link salp-inspired system by removing joint actuators, introducing link thrusters, and allowing for non-uniform link lengths, masses, and moments of inertia. Second, we conduct a nonlinear observability analysis of the multi-link system with link thrusters, showing that the link angles, angular velocities, masses, and moments of inertia are locally observable when equipped with inertial measurement units and operating under specific thruster conditions. This research provides a theoretical foundation for modeling and estimating both the state and intrinsic parameters of a multi-link system with link thrusters, which are essential for effective controller design and performance.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization with Unknown Time-varying Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study optimization problems where the cost function contains time-varying parameters that are unmeasurable and evolve according to linear, yet unknown, dynamics. We propose a solution that leverages control theoretic tools to identify the dynamics of the parameters, predict their evolution, and ultimately compute a solution to the optimization problem. The identification of the dynamics of the time-varying parameters is done online using measurements of the gradient of the cost function. This system identification problem is not standard, since the output matrix is known and the dynamics of the parameters must be estimated in the original coordinates without similarity transformations. Interestingly, our analysis shows that, under mild conditions that we characterize, the identification of the parameters dynamics and, consequently, the computation of a time-varying solution to the optimization problem, requires only a finite number of measurements of the gradient of the cost function. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a series of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Semi-Gradient SARSA Routing with Theoretical Guarantee on Traffic Stability and Weight Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the traffic control problem of dynamic routing over parallel servers, which arises in a variety of engineering systems such as transportation and data transmission. We propose a semi-gradient, on-policy algorithm that learns an approximate optimal routing policy. The algorithm uses generic basis functions with flexible weights to approximate the value function across the unbounded state space. Consequently, the training process lacks Lipschitz continuity of the gradient, boundedness of the temporal-difference error, and a prior guarantee on ergodicity, which are the standard prerequisites in existing literature on reinforcement learning theory. To address this, we combine a Lyapunov approach and an ordinary differential equation-based method to jointly characterize the behavior of traffic state and approximation weights. Our theoretical analysis proves that the training scheme guarantees traffic state stability and ensures almost surely convergence of the weights to the approximate optimum. We also demonstrate via simulations that our algorithm attains significantly faster convergence than neural network-based methods with an insignificant approximation error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies equality-constrained composite minimization problems. This class of problems, capturing regularization terms and convex inequality constraints, naturally arises in a wide range of engineering and machine learning applications. To tackle these minimization problems, we introduce the \emph{proportional--integral proximal gradient dynamics} (PI--PGD): a closed-loop system where the Lagrange multipliers are control inputs and states are the problem decision variables. First, we establish the equivalence between the minima of the optimization problem and the equilibria of the PI--PGD. Then, leveraging tools from contraction theory, we give a comprehensive convergence analysis for the dynamics, showing linear--exponential convergence towards the equilibrium. That is, the distance between each solution and the equilibrium is upper bounded by a function that first decreases linearly and then exponentially. Our findings are illustrated numerically on a set of representative examples, which include an application to entropic-regularized optimal transport.</description>

Abstract: We propose Diffusion-Informed Model Predictive Control (D-I MPC), a generic framework for uncertainty-aware prediction and decision-making in partially observable stochastic systems by integrating diffusion-based time series forecasting models in Model Predictive Control algorithms. In our approach, a diffusion-based time series forecasting model is used to probabilistically estimate the evolution of the system's stochastic components. These forecasts are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state. Experimental results indicate that our model-based approach with a diffusion-based forecaster significantly outperforms both implementations with classical forecasting methods and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Human Motion Models in Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Social Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social robot navigation is an evolving research field that aims to find efficient strategies to safely navigate dynamic environments populated by humans. A critical challenge in this domain is the accurate modeling of human motion, which directly impacts the design and evaluation of navigation algorithms. This paper presents a comparative study of two popular categories of human motion models used in social robot navigation, namely velocity-based models and force-based models. A system-theoretic representation of both model types is presented, which highlights their common feedback structure, although with different state variables. Several navigation policies based on reinforcement learning are trained and tested in various simulated environments involving pedestrian crowds modeled with these approaches. A comparative study is conducted to assess performance across multiple factors, including human motion model, navigation policy, scenario complexity and crowd density. The results highlight advantages and challenges of different approaches to modeling human behavior, as well as their role during training and testing of learning-based navigation policies. The findings offer valuable insights and guidelines for selecting appropriate human motion models when designing socially-aware robot navigation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popularity dynamics in social media depend on a complex interplay of social influence between users and popularity-based recommendations that are provided by the platforms. In this work, we introduce a discrete-time dynamical system to model the evolution of popularity on social media. Our model generalizes the well-known Friedkin-Johnsen model to a set of influencers vying for popularity. We study the asymptotic behavior of this model and illustrate it with numerical examples. Our results highlight the interplay of social influence, past popularity, and content quality in determining the popularity of influencers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of autonomous virtual avatars (in extended reality) and robots in human group activities - such as rehabilitation therapy, sports, and manufacturing - is expected to increase as these technologies become more pervasive. Designing cognitive architectures and control strategies to drive these agents requires realistic models of human motion. However, existing models only provide simplified descriptions of human motor behavior. In this work, we propose a fully data-driven approach, based on Long Short-Term Memory neural networks, to generate original motion that captures the unique characteristics of specific individuals. We validate the architecture using real data of scalar oscillatory motion. Extensive analyses show that our model effectively replicates the velocity distribution and amplitude envelopes of the individual it was trained on, remaining different from other individuals, and outperforming state-of-the-art models in terms of similarity to human data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient solution of moderately large-scale linear systems arising from the KKT conditions in optimal control problems (OCPs) is a critical challenge in robotics. With the stagnation of Moore's law, there is growing interest in leveraging GPU-accelerated iterative methods, and corresponding parallel preconditioners, to overcome these computational challenges. To improve the computational performance of such solvers, we introduce a parallel-friendly, parametrized multi-splitting polynomial preconditioner framework that leverages positive and negative factors. Our approach results in improved convergence of the linear systems solves needed in OCPs. We construct and prove the optimal parametrization of multi-splitting theoretically and demonstrate empirically a 76% reduction in condition number and 46% in iteration counts on a series of numerical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Brunovsky Riccati Recursion for Linear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In almost all algorithms for Model Predictive Control (MPC), the most time-consuming step is to solve some form of Linear Quadratic (LQ) Optimal Control Problem (OCP) repeatedly. The commonly recognized best option for this is a Riccati recursion based solver, which has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N(n_x^3 + n_x^2 n_u + n_x n_u^2 + n_u^3))$. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{Brunovsky Riccati Recursion} algorithm to solve LQ OCPs for Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems. The algorithm transforms the system into Brunovsky form, formulates a new LQ cost (and constraints, if any) in Brunovsky coordinates, performs the Riccati recursion there, and converts the solution back. Due to the sparsity (block-diagonality and zero-one pattern per block) of Brunovsky form and the data parallelism introduced in the cost, constraints, and solution transformations, the time complexity of the new method is greatly reduced to $\mathcal{O}(n_x^3 + N(n_x^2 n_u + n_x n_u^2 + n_u^3))$ if $N$ threads/cores are available for parallel computing.</description>

      <title>Blocked Cholesky factorization updates of the Riccati recursion using hyperbolic Householder transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Newton systems in quadratic programming (QP) methods are often solved using direct Cholesky or LDL factorizations. When the linear systems in successive iterations differ by a low-rank modification (as is common in active set and augmented Lagrangian methods), updating the existing factorization can offer significant performance improvements over recomputing a full Cholesky factorization. We review the hyperbolic Householder transformation, and demonstrate its usefulness in describing low-rank Cholesky factorization updates. By applying this hyperbolic Householder-based framework to the well-known Riccati recursion for solving saddle-point problems with optimal control structure, we develop a novel algorithm for updating the factorizations used in optimization solvers for optimal control. Specifically, the proposed method can be used to efficiently solve the semismooth Newton systems that are at the core of the augmented Lagrangian-based QPALM-OCP solver. An optimized open-source implementation of the proposed factorization update routines is provided as well.</description>

      <title>Friction-Scaled Vibrotactile Feedback for Real-Time Slip Detection in Manipulation using Robotic Sixth Finger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of extra-robotic limbs/fingers to enhance and expand motor skills, particularly for grasping and manipulation, possesses significant challenges. The grasping performance of existing limbs/fingers is far inferior to that of human hands. Human hands can detect onset of slip through tactile feedback originating from tactile receptors during the grasping process, enabling precise and automatic regulation of grip force. The frictional information is perceived by humans depending upon slip happening between finger and object. Enhancing this capability in extra-robotic limbs or fingers used by humans is challenging. To address this challenge, this paper introduces novel approach to communicate frictional information to users through encoded vibrotactile cues. These cues are conveyed on onset of incipient slip thus allowing users to perceive friction and ultimately use this information to increase force to avoid dropping of object. In a 2-alternative forced-choice protocol, participants gripped and lifted a glass under three different frictional conditions, applying a normal force of 3.5 N. After reaching this force, glass was gradually released to induce slip. During this slipping phase, vibrations scaled according to static coefficient of friction were presented to users, reflecting frictional conditions. The results suggested an accuracy of 94.53 p/m 3.05 (mean p/mSD) in perceiving frictional information upon lifting objects with varying friction. The results indicate effectiveness of using vibrotactile feedback for sensory feedback, allowing users of extra-robotic limbs or fingers to perceive frictional information. This enables them to assess surface properties and adjust grip force according to frictional conditions, enhancing their ability to grasp, manipulate objects more effectively.</description>

      <title>More Information is Not Always Better: Connections between Zero-Sum Local Nash Equilibria in Feedback and Open-Loop Information Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-cooperative dynamic game theory provides a principled approach to modeling sequential decision-making among multiple noncommunicative agents. A key focus has been on finding Nash equilibria in two-agent zero-sum dynamic games under various information structures. A well-known result states that in linear-quadratic games, unique Nash equilibria under feedback and open-loop information structures yield identical trajectories. Motivated by two key perspectives -- (i) many real-world problems extend beyond linear-quadratic settings and lack unique equilibria, making only local Nash equilibria computable, and (ii) local open-loop Nash equilibria (OLNE) are easier to compute than local feedback Nash equilibria (FBNE) -- it is natural to ask whether a similar result holds for local equilibria in zero-sum games. To this end, we establish that for a broad class of zero-sum games with potentially nonconvex-nonconcave objectives and nonlinear dynamics: (i) the state/control trajectory of a local FBNE satisfies local OLNE first-order optimality conditions, and vice versa, (ii) a local FBNE trajectory satisfies local OLNE second-order necessary conditions, (iii) a local FBNE trajectory satisfying feedback sufficiency conditions also constitutes a local OLNE, and (iv) with additional hard constraints on agents' actuations, a local FBNE where strict complementarity holds also satisfies local OLNE first-order optimality conditions, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Continuous Variables and Priority Assignments for Real-Time Systems with Black-box Schedulability Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-time systems optimization, designers often face a challenging problem posed by the non-convex and non-continuous schedulability conditions, which may even lack an analytical form to understand their properties. To tackle this challenging problem, we treat the schedulability analysis as a black box that only returns true/false results. We propose a general and scalable framework to optimize real-time systems, named Numerical Optimizer with Real-Time Highlight (NORTH). NORTH is built upon the gradient-based active-set methods from the numerical optimization literature but with new methods to manage active constraints for the non-differentiable schedulability constraints. In addition, we also generalize NORTH to NORTH+, to collaboratively optimize certain types of discrete variables (e.g., priority assignments, categorical variables) with continuous variables based on numerical optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the algorithm performance with two example applications: energy minimization based on dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and optimization of control system performance. In these experiments, NORTH achieved $10^2$ to $10^5$ times speed improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar or better solution quality. NORTH+ outperforms NORTH by 30% with similar algorithm scalability. Both NORTH and NORTH+ support black-box schedulability analysis, ensuring broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Line zonotopes: a set representation suitable for unbounded systems and its application to set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis of descriptor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes new methods for set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis (AFD) of linear descriptor systems (LDS). Unlike intervals, ellipsoids, and zonotopes, constrained zonotopes (CZs) can directly incorporate linear static constraints on state variables - typical of descriptor systems - into their mathematical representation, leading to less conservative enclosures. However, for LDS that are unstable or not fully observable, a bounded representation cannot ensure a valid enclosure of the states over time. To address this limitation, we introduce line zonotopes, a new representation for unbounded sets that retains key properties of CZs, including polynomial time complexity reduction methods, while enabling the description of strips, hyperplanes, and the entire n-dimensional Euclidean space. This extension not only generalizes the use of CZs to unbounded settings but can also enhance set-based estimation and AFD in both stable and unstable scenarios. Additionally, we extend the AFD method for LDS from Rego et al. (2020) to operate over reachable tubes rather than solely on the reachable set at the final time of the considered horizon. This reduces conservatism in input separation and enables more accurate fault diagnosis based on the entire output sequence. The advantages of the proposed methods over existing CZ-based approaches are demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policy iteration is one of the classical frameworks of reinforcement learning, which requires a known initial stabilizing control. However, finding the initial stabilizing control depends on the known system model. To relax this requirement and achieve model-free optimal control, in this paper, two different reinforcement learning algorithms based on policy iteration and variable damping coefficients are designed for unknown discrete-time linear systems. First, a stable artificial system is designed, and this system is gradually iterated to the original system by varying the damping coefficients. This allows the initial stabilizing control to be obtained in a finite number of iteration steps. Then, an off-policy iteration algorithm and an off-policy $\mathcal{Q}$-learning algorithm are designed to select the appropriate damping coefficients and realize data-driven. In these two algorithms, the current estimates of optimal control gain are not applied to the system to re-collect data. Moreover, they are characterized by the fast convergence of the traditional policy iteration. Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.</description>

      <title>Input Delay Compensation for a Class of Switched Linear Systems via Averaging Exact Predictor Feedbacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The key challenges in design of predictor-based control laws for switched systems with arbitrary switching and long input delay are the potential unavailability of the future values of the switching signal (at current time) and the fact that dwell time may be arbitrary. In the present paper, we resolve these challenges developing a new predictor-based control law that is, essentially, an average of exact predictor feedbacks, each one corresponding to an exact predictor-feedback law for a system that operates only in a single mode. Because the predictor state in our control design does not correspond to an exact predictor, stability can be guaranteed under a restriction on the differences among the system's matrices and controller's gains. This is an unavoidable limitation, for a switching signal whose future values may be unavailable, when no constraint is imposed on the values of delay and dwell time (as it is the case here). We establish (uniform) stability of the closed-loop system employing a Lyapunov functional. The key step in the stability proof is constructive derivation of an estimate of the mismatch between an exact predictor feedback and the average of predictor feedbacks constructed. We illustrate the performance of the proposed predictor-based control law in simulation, including comparisons with alternative, predictor-based control laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel model-free and a partially model-free algorithm for inverse optimal control (IOC), also known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), aimed at estimating the cost function of continuous-time nonlinear deterministic systems. Using the input-state trajectories of an expert agent, the proposed algorithms separately utilize control policy information and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to estimate different sets of cost function parameters. This approach allows the algorithms to achieve broader applicability while maintaining a model-free framework. Also, the model-free algorithm reduces complexity compared to existing methods, as it requires solving a forward optimal control problem only once during initialization. Furthermore, in our partially model-free algorithm, this step can be bypassed entirely for systems with known input dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms, highlighting their potential for real-world deployment in autonomous systems and robotics.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear real time capable motion cueing algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In motion simulation, motion cueing algorithms are used for the trajectory planning of the motion simulator platform, where workspace limitations prevent direct reproduction of reference trajectories. Strategies such as motion washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter optimization. After detailing the necessary training framework and the algorithm itself, we provide a comprehensive validation, demonstrating that the DRL MCA achieves competitive performance against established algorithms. Moreover, it generates feasible trajectories by respecting all system constraints and meets all real-time requirements with low...</description>

      <title>From Autonomous Agents to Integrated Systems, A New Paradigm: Orchestrated Distributed Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era of integrated systems that merge computational prowess with human decision-making. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Orchestrated Distributed Intelligence (ODI), a novel paradigm that reconceptualizes AI not as isolated autonomous agents, but as cohesive, orchestrated networks that work in tandem with human expertise. ODI leverages advanced orchestration layers, multi-loop feedback mechanisms, and a high cognitive density framework to transform static, record-keeping systems into dynamic, action-oriented environments. Through a comprehensive review of multi-agent system literature, recent technological advances, and practical insights from industry forums, we argue that the future of AI lies in integrating distributed intelligence within human-centric workflows. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency and strategic agility but also addresses challenges related to scalability, transparency, and ethical decision-making. Our work outlines key theoretical implications and presents a practical roadmap for future research and enterprise innovation, aiming to pave the way for responsible and adaptive AI systems that drive sustainable innovation in human organizations.</description>

      <title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Motion Cueing Algorithm for Vehicle Driving Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion cueing algorithms (MCA) are used to control the movement of motion simulation platforms (MSP) to reproduce the motion perception of a real vehicle driver as accurately as possible without exceeding the limits of the workspace of the MSP. Existing approaches either produce non-optimal results due to filtering, linearization, or simplifications, or the computational time required exceeds the real-time requirements of a closed-loop application. This work presents a new solution to the motion cueing problem, where instead of a human designer specifying the principles of the MCA, an artificial intelligence (AI) learns the optimal motion by trial and error in interaction with the MSP. To achieve this, a well-established deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is applied, where an agent interacts with an environment, allowing him to directly control a simulated MSP to obtain feedback on its performance. The RL algorithm used is proximal policy optimization (PPO), where the value function and the policy corresponding to the control strategy are both learned and mapped in artificial neural networks (ANN). This approach is implemented in Python and the functionality is demonstrated by the practical example of pre-recorded lateral maneuvers. The subsequent validation shows that the RL algorithm is able to learn the control strategy and improve the quality of the immersion compared to an established method. Thereby, the perceived motion signals determined by a model of the vestibular system are more accurately reproduced, and the resources of the MSP are used more economically.</description>

      <title>Clutter-Aware Target Detection for ISAC in a Millimeter-Wave Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each access point (AP) operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The APs jointly serve the user equipments (UEs) in the downlink while simultaneously detecting a target through dedicated sensing beams, which are directed toward a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Although the AP-RIS, RIS-target, and AP-target channels have both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) parts, it is assumed only knowledge of the LoS paths is available. A key contribution of this study is the consideration of clutter, which degrades the target detection if not handled. We propose an algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit power allocation and the RIS phase-shift matrix, maximizing the target signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the UEs. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting clutter subspace significantly enhances detection probability, particularly at high clutter-to-noise ratios, and reveal that an increased number of transmit side clusters impair detection performance. Finally, we highlight the performance gains achieved using a dedicated sensing stream.</description>

      <title>The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics are stable (i.e. contracting exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless they produce highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</description>

      <title>ISLS: IoT-Based Smart Lighting System for Improving Energy Conservation in Office Buildings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the Internet of Things (IoT) fostering seamless device-to-human and device-to-device interactions, the domain of intelligent lighting systems have evolved beyond simple occupancy and daylight sensing towards autonomous monitoring and control of power consumption and illuminance levels. To this regard, this paper proposes a new do-it-yourself (DIY) IoT-based method of smart lighting system featuring an illuminance control algorithm. The design involves the integration of occupancy and presence sensors alongside a communication module, to enable real-time wireless interaction and remote monitoring of the system parameters from any location through an end-user application. A constrained optimization problem was formulated to determine the optimal dimming vector for achieving target illuminance at minimal power consumption. The simplex algorithm was used to solve this problem, and the system's performance was validated through both MATLAB simulations and real-world prototype testing in an indoor office environment. The obtained experimental results demonstrate substantial power savings across multiple user occupancy scenarios, achieving reductions of approx. 80%, 48%, and 26% for one, two, and four user settings, respectively, in comparison to traditional basic lighting installation systems.</description>

      <title>AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with modeling, analysis, and optimization of power amplifiers (PAs) placed in a cascaded structure, particularly the effect of cascaded nonlinearities is studied by showing potential ways to minimize the total nonlinearities. The nonlinear least-squares algorithm is proposed to optimize the PA parameters along with the input power level, and thereby minimize the total nonlinearities in the cascaded structure. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the optimized configurations for up to five PAs using the proposed framework can improve the linearity properties of the overall cascade.</description>
