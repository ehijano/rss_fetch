      <title>Direct and Efficient Detection of Quantum Superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most striking quantum phenomena is superposition, where one particle simultaneously inhabits different states. Most methods to verify coherent superposition are indirect, in that they require the distinct states to be recombined. Here, we adapt an XOR game, in which separated parties measure different parts of a superposed particle, and use it to verify superpositions with \textit{local measurements} and a second independent particle. We then turn this game into a resource-efficient verification scheme, obtaining a confidence that the particle is superposed which approaches unity exponentially fast. We demonstrate our scheme using a single photon, obtaining a 99\% confidence that the particle is superposed with only 37 copies. Our work shows the utility of XOR games to verify quantum resources, allowing us to efficiently detect quantum superposition without reinterfering the superposed states.</description>

      <title>An Abstract Model and Efficient Routing for Logical Entangling Gates on Zoned Neutral Atom Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental achievements have demonstrated the potential of neutral atom architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computing. These architectures feature the dynamic rearrangement of atoms during computation, enabling nearly arbitrary two-dimensional rearrangements. Additionally, they employ a zoned layout with dedicated regions for entangling, storage, and readout. This architecture requires design automation software that efficiently compiles quantum circuits to this hardware and takes care that atoms are in the right place at the right time. In this paper, we initiate this line of work by providing, (1) an abstract model of the novel architecture and, (2) an efficient solution to the routing problem of entangling gates. By this, we aim to maximize the parallelism of entangling gates and minimize the overhead caused by the routing of atoms between zones. In addition to that, we keep the realm of fault-tolerant quantum computing in mind and consider logical qubit arrays, each of which encodes one logical qubit. We implemented the proposed idea as a tool called NALAC and demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency by showing that it can significantly reduce the routing overhead of logical entangling gates compared to the naive approach. As part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), NALAC is publicly available as open-source at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap.</description>

      <title>Tweezer interferometry with NOON states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic interferometers measure phase differences along paths with exceptional precision. Tweezer interferometry is a novel approach for performing this task. It allows to guide the particles along pre-defined trajectories. We explore the feasibility of using condensed bosons in tweezer interferometry. As opposed to factor $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement with ${N \sim 100}$ fermions, here we expect factor ${N}$ enhancement using NOON state interferometry. The proposed protocol involves adiabatic splitting and merging, followed by adiabatic branching of condensed bosons. The purpose of the latter step is phase encoding. Spontaneous symmetry breaking should be avoided. We estimate the time that is required for performing those sweep processes.</description>

      <title>Defining subsystems in Hilbert spaces with non-Euclidean metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics is a trivial extension of regular quantum mechanics. The modified inner-product space defined through the so-called metric operator, turns out to be the most natural way to represent certain phenomena such as those involving balanced gain and loss. However, for composite systems undergoing pseudo-Hermitian evolution, defining the subsystems is generally considered feasible only when the metric operator is chosen to have a tensor product. In this work, we use arguments from algebraic quantum mechanics to show that the subsystems can be well-defined in every metric space -- irrespective of whether or not the metric is of tensor product form. This is done by identifying subsystems with a decomposition of the underlying algebra into sub-algebras. In fact, we show that different decompositions of the underlying $C^*-$algebra correspond to choosing different equivalence classes of metric operators. We show how each of the subsystems, defined this way, can be tomographically constructed and that these subsystems satisfy the no-signaling principle. Therefore, we put all the choices of the metric on an equal footing.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Parameterized Quantum Circuits Expressibility Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are fundamental to quantum machine learning (QML), quantum optimization, and variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). The expressibility of PQCs is a measure that determines their capability to harness the full potential of the quantum state space. It is thus a crucial guidepost to know when selecting a particular PQC ansatz. However, the existing technique for expressibility computation through statistical estimation requires a large number of samples, which poses significant challenges due to time and computational resource constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach for expressibility estimation of PQCs using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We demonstrate the predictive power of our GNN model with a dataset consisting of 25,000 samples from the noiseless IBM QASM Simulator and 12,000 samples from three distinct noisy quantum backends. The model accurately estimates expressibility, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.05 and 0.06 for the noiseless and noisy backends, respectively. We compare our model's predictions with reference circuits [Sim and others, QuTe'2019] and IBM Qiskit's hardware-efficient ansatz sets to further evaluate our model's performance. Our experimental evaluation in noiseless and noisy scenarios reveals a close alignment with ground truth expressibility values, highlighting the model's efficacy. Moreover, our model exhibits promising extrapolation capabilities, predicting expressibility values with low RMSE for out-of-range qubit circuits trained solely on only up to 5-qubit circuit sets. This work thus provides a reliable means of efficiently evaluating the expressibility of diverse PQCs on noiseless simulators and hardware.</description>

      <title>A novel multi-photon entangled state with enhanced resilience to path loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of quantum information, entanglement stands as a cornerstone phenomenon. It underpins a vast array of quantum information processes, offering significant potential for advancements in quantum computing, communication, and sensing. This paper introduces a novel multi-photon entangled state, which generalizes the maximally entangled single-photon state and exhibits remarkable resilience to signal attenuation in photonic applications. We demonstrate the novelty of the proposed state through a simplified target detection model and illustrate its superior performance over traditional single-photon protocols, attributed to its higher entanglement level and enhanced noise suppression capabilities. Our findings suggest that the proposed multi-photon state holds significant promise for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of photonic applications subject to loss. This work lays the groundwork for future exploration into the practical applications of multi-photon entangled states in quantum technologies, potentially revolutionizing our approach to quantum sensing and beyond</description>

      <title>Exact Synthesis of Multiqutrit Clifford-Cyclotomic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the unitary matrices that can be exactly represented by a multiqubit circuit over the Toffoli+Hadamard, Clifford+$T$, or, more generally, Clifford-cyclotomic gate set are precisely the unitary matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_k]$, where $k$ is a positive integer that depends on the gate set and $\zeta_k$ is a primitive $2^k$-th root of unity. In this paper, we establish the analogous correspondence for qutrits. We define the multiqutrit Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of order $3^k$ by extending the classical qutrit gates $X$, $CX$, and Toffoli with the Hadamard gate $H$ and the single-qutrit gate $T_k=\mathrm{diag}(1,\omega_k, \omega_k^2)$, where $\omega_k$ is a primitive $3^k$-th root of unity. This gate set is equivalent to the qutrit Toffoli+Hadamard gate set when $k=1$, and to the qutrit Clifford+$T_k$ gate set when $k&gt;1$. We then prove that a $3^n\times 3^n$ unitary matrix $U$ can be represented by an $n$-qutrit circuit over the Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of order $3^k$ if and only if the entries of $U$ lie in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/3,\omega_k]$.</description>

      <title>A logical qubit-design with geometrically tunable error-resistibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking the error-threshold would mark a milestone in establishing quantum advantage for a wide range of relevant problems. One possible route is to encode information redundantly in a logical qubit by combining several noisy qubits, providing an increased robustness against external perturbations. We propose a setup for a logical qubit built from superconducting qubits (SCQs) coupled to a microwave cavity-mode. Our design is based on a recently discovered geometric stabilizing mechanism in the Bose-Hubbard wheel (BHW), which manifests as energetically well-separated clusters of many-body eigenstates. We investigate the impact of experimentally relevant perturbations between SCQs and the cavity on the spectral properties of the BHW. We show that even in the presence of typical fabrication uncertainties, the occurrence and separation of clustered many-body eigenstates is extremely robust. Introducing an additional, frequency-detuned SCQ coupled to the cavity yields duplicates of these clusters, that can be split up by an on-site potential. We show that this allows to (i) redundantly encode two logical qubit states that can be switched and read out efficiently and (ii) can be separated from the remaining many-body spectrum via geometric stabilization. We demonstrate at the example of an X-gate that the proposed logical qubit reaches single qubit-gate fidelities $&gt;0.999$ in experimentally feasible temperature regimes $\sim10-20\,\mathrm{mK}$.</description>

      <title>Parallel two-qubit entangling gates via QND interaction controlled by rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an analysis of entangling and non-local operations in a quantum nondemolition (QND) interaction between multimode light with orbital angular momentum and an atomic ensemble. A protocol consisting of two QND operations with rotations of quadratures of atomic spin coherence and light between them provides a wide range of two-qubit operations, while the multimode nature of the chosen degrees of freedom allows the implementation of parallel operations over multiple two-qubit systems. We have used the formalism of equivalence classes and local invariants to evaluate the properties of two-qubit transformations. It is shown that, when selecting suitable values of the governing parameters - the duration of each of the two QND interactions and the rotation angles of the qubits - the protocol allows to realise a deterministic non-local SWAP operation and entangling square-root-SWAP operation with probability 1/3.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Optimal-Speed Quantum Evolutions: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of two different constructions of optimal-speed quantum Hamiltonian evolutions on the Bloch sphere. In the first approach (Mostafazadeh's approach), the evolution is specified by a traceless stationary Hermitian Hamiltonian and occurs between two arbitrary qubit states by maximizing the energy uncertainty. In the second approach (Bender's approach), instead, the evolution is characterized by a stationary Hermitian Hamiltonian which is not traceless and occurs between an initial qubit on the north pole and an arbitrary final qubit. In this second approach, the evolution occurs by minimizing the evolution time subject to the constraint that the difference between the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian is kept fixed. For both approaches we calculate explicitly the optimal Hamiltonian, the optimal unitary evolution operator and, finally, the optimal magnetic field configuration. Furthermore, we show in a clear way that Mostafazadeh's and Bender's approaches are equivalent when we extend Mostafazadeh's approach to Hamiltonians with nonzero trace and, at the same time, focus on an initial quantum state placed on the north pole of the Bloch sphere. Finally, we demonstrate in both scenarios that the optimal unitary evolution operator is a rotation about an axis that is orthogonal to the unit Bloch vectors that correspond to the initial and final qubit states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact synthesis algorithm for qutrit unitaries in $\mathcal{U}_{3^n}(\mathbb{Z}[1/3,e^{2\pi i/3}])$ over the Clifford$+T$ gate set with at most one ancilla. This extends the already known result of qutrit metaplectic gates being a subset of Clifford$+T$ gate set with one ancilla. As an intermediary step, we construct an algorithm to convert 3-level unitaries into multiply-controlled gates, analogous to Gray codes converting 2-level unitaries into multiply-controlled gates. Finally, using catalytic embeddings, we present an algorithm to exactly synthesize unitaries $\mathcal{U}_{3^n}(\mathbb{Z}[1/3,e^{2\pi i/9}])$ over the Clifford$+T$ gate set with at most 2 ancillas. This, in particular, gives an exact synthesis algorithm of single-qutrit Clifford$+\mathcal{D}$ over the multi-qutrit Clifford$+T$ gate set with at most two ancillas.</description>

      <title>From Entanglement to Universality: A Multiparticle Spacetime Algebra Approach to Quantum Computational Gates Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative mathematical explorations in quantum computing can be of great scientific interest, especially if they come with penetrating physical insights. In this paper, we present a critical revisitation of our geometric (Clifford) algebras (GAs) application in quantum computing as originally presented in [C. Cafaro and S. Mancini, Adv. Appl. Clifford Algebras 21, 493 (2011)]. Our focus is on testing the usefulness of geometric algebras (GAs) techniques in two applications to quantum computing. First, making use of the geometric algebra of a relativistic configuration space (a.k.a., multiparticle spacetime algebra or MSTA), we offer an explicit algebraic characterization of one- and two-qubit quantum states together with a MSTA description of one- and two-qubit quantum computational gates. In this first application, we devote special attention to the concept of entanglement, focusing on entangled quantum states and two-qubit entangling quantum gates. Second, exploiting the previously mentioned MSTA characterization together with the GA depiction of the Lie algebras SO(3;R) and SU(2;C) depending on the rotor group formalism, we focus our attention to the concept of universality in quantum computing by reevaluating Boykin's proof on the identification of a suitable set of universal quantum gates. At the end of our mathematical exploration, we arrive at two main conclusions. Firstly, the MSTA perspective leads to a powerful conceptual unification between quantum states and quantum operators. More specifically, the complex qubit space and the complex space of unitary operators acting on them merge in a single multivectorial real space. Secondly, the GA viewpoint on rotations based on the rotor group carries both conceptual and computational upper hands compared to conventional vectorial and matricial methods.</description>

      <title>Towards a fiber-optic temporally multiplexed single photon source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a photon source with sub-Poissonian emission statistics through temporal multiplexing of a continuous wave heralded photon source in the optical communications wavelength range. We use the time arrival information of a heralding photon to actively modify the delay of the heralded photon in an all-fiber assembly, in order to synchronize the output with with respect to an external clock. Within this synchronized operating regime we show that the addition of a single temporal correcting stage can improve the figure of merit for single photon emission of a heralded photon source. We obtain a brightness improvement factor of approximately 1.8 and an enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio, quantified by the coincidence-to-accidental counts ratio. These results, clear the way for integrated optics non-classical photon sources in the optical communication band.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable generation of spatial entanglement in nonlinear waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously-coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of spatially entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in AlGaAs nonlinear waveguides arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously-coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multi-component quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.</description>

      <title>Barren plateaus induced by the dimension of qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as pivotal strategies for attaining quantum advantages in diverse scientific and technological domains, notably within Quantum Neural Networks. However, despite their potential, VQAs encounter significant obstacles, chief among them being the gradient vanishing problem, commonly referred to as barren plateaus. In this study, we unveil a direct correlation between the dimension of qudits and the occurrence of barren plateaus, a connection previously overlooked. Through meticulous analysis, we demonstrate that existing literature implicitly suggests the intrinsic influence of qudit dimensionality on barren plateaus. To instantiate these findings, we present numerical results that exemplify the impact of qudit dimensionality on barren plateaus. Additionally, despite the proposition of various error mitigation techniques, our results call for further scrutiny about their efficacy in the context of VQAs with qudits.</description>

Abstract: Assuming the validity of the equivalence principle in the quantum regime, we argue that one of the assumptions of the usual definition of quantum mechanics, namely separation between the ``classical'' detector and the ``quantum'' system, must be relaxed. We argue, therefore, that if both the equivalence principle and quantum mechanics continue to survive experimental tests, that this favors ``epistemic'' interpretations of quantum mechanics (where formalism is built around relations between observables) over ``ontic ones'' (assuming the reality of states and wavefunctions). In particular, we show that relational type interpretations can readily accomodate the equivalence principle via a minor modification of the assumptions used to justify the formalism.
  We qualitatively speculate what a full generally covariant quantum dynamics could look like, and comment on experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Plaquette Models, Cellular Automata, and Measurement-induced Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of two-dimensional randomized plaquette models, where the multi-spin interaction term, referred to as the plaquette term, is replaced by a single-site spin term with a probability of $1-p$. By varying $p$, we observe a ground state phase transition, or equivalently, a phase transition of the symmetry operator. We find that as we vary $p$, the symmetry operator changes from being extensive to being localized in space. These models can be equivalently understood as 1+1D randomized cellular automaton dynamics, allowing the 2D transition to be interpreted as a 1+1D dynamical absorbing phase transition. In this paper, our primary focus is on the plaquette term with three or five-body interactions, where we explore the universality classes of the transitions. Specifically, for the model with five-body interaction, we demonstrate that it belongs to the same universality class as the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition observed in 1+1D Clifford dynamics, as well as the boundary entanglement transition of the 2D cluster state induced by random bulk Pauli measurements. This work establishes a connection between transitions in classical spin models, cellular automata, and hybrid random circuits.</description>

Abstract: A quantum neural network (QNN) is an object that extends the notion of a classical neural network to quantum models for quantum data. We can create a QNN by parametrizing a quantum process and then using it to model unknown relations between quantum states. In this paper, we explore how to use measurement-based quantum computation for quantum machine learning problems and propose a universal QNN in this framework which we call the multiple-triangle ansatz (MuTA). Using the proposed QNN, we solve several tasks, including learning a universal set of gates, optimizing measurement with post-processing, learning a quantum instrument, and the classification of classical data. Finally, we discuss how to train an ansatz under the hardware constraints imposed by photonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using measurement-based quantum computation as a framework for quantum machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions, lower bounds and trade-off relations for quantumness in Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability is a quantum analog of classical phase space probability. It offers an informationally complete representation of quantum state wherein the quantumness associated with quantum noncommutativity manifests in its nonclassical values, i.e., the nonreal and/or negative values of the real part. This naturally raises a question: how does such form of quantumness comply with the uncertainty principle which also arise from quantum noncommutativity? Here, first, we obtain sufficient conditions for the KD quasiprobability defined relative to a pair of PVM (projection-valued measure) bases to have nonclassical values. Using these nonclassical values, we then introduce two quantities which capture the amount of KD quantumness in a quantum state relative to a single PVM basis. They are defined respectively as the nonreality, and the classicality which captures both the nonreality and negativity, of the associated KD quasiprobability over the PVM basis of interest, and another PVM basis, and maximized over all possible choices of the latter. We obtain their lower bounds, and derive trade-off relations respectively reminiscent of the Robertson and Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relations but with lower bounds maximized over the convex sets of Hermitian operators whose complete sets of eigenprojectors are given by the PVM bases. We discuss their measurement using weak value measurement and classical optimization, and suggest information theoretical and operational interpretations in terms of optimal estimation of the PVM basis and state disturbance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics, the physical change in time and a pillar of natural sciences, can be regarded as an emergent phenomenon when the system of interest is part of a larger, static one. This "relational approach to time", in which the system's environment provides a temporal reference, does not only provide insight into foundational issues of physics, but holds the potential for a deeper theoretical understanding as it intimately links statics and dynamics. Reinforcing the significance of this connection, we demonstrate, based on recent progress [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 140202 (2023)], the role of emergent time as a vital link between time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics. We calculate first order contributions, which are often the most significant, and discuss the issue of degenerate spectra. Based on our results, we envision future applications for the calculation of dynamical phenomena based on a single pure energy eigenstate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum phase transitions in physical systems is fundamental to characterize their behaviour at small temperatures. Achieving this requires both accessing good approximations to the ground state and identifying order parameters to distinguish different phases. Addressing these challenges, our work introduces a hybrid algorithm that combines quantum optimization with classical machine learning. This approach leverages the capability of near-term quantum computers to prepare locally trapped states through finite optimization. Specifically, we utilize LASSO for identifying conventional phase transitions and the Transformer model for topological transitions, applying these with a sliding window of Hamiltonian parameters to learn appropriate order parameters and estimate the critical points accurately. We verified the effectiveness of our method with numerical simulation and real-hardware experiments on Rigetti's Ankaa 9Q-1 quantum computer. Our protocol not only provides a robust framework for investigating quantum phase transitions using shallow quantum circuits but also significantly enhances efficiency and precision, opening new avenues in the integration of quantum computing and machine learning.</description>

      <title>A superresolution-based quantum spectrometer using a pair of phase-controlled spatial light modulators satisfying the Heisenberg limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a phase-controlled superresolution has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated using the classical light of a continuous-wave laser to overcome the shot-noise limit in classical physics as well as to solve the limited N in N00N-based quantum sensing. Here, the superresolution is applied to a quantum spectrometer using phase-controlled spatial light modulators (SLMs) in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. For the validity of the proposed method, a general solution is analytically derived from the SLM-based projection measurements, and numerical calculations are conducted for the N-dependent phase sensitivity and resolution. Besides, a classical spectrometer is numerically compared, whose resolution is the same as the superresolution. However, the phase sensitivity of the SLM-based quantum spectrometer shows a quantum advantage due to the reduced scan range, whereas the classical one has no change.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium propagation is a recently introduced method to use and train artificial neural networks in which the network is at the minimum (more generally extremum) of an energy functional. Equilibrium propagation has shown good performance on a number of benchmark tasks. Here we extend equilibrium propagation in two directions. First we show that there is a natural quantum generalization of equilibrium propagation in which a quantum neural network is taken to be in the ground state (more generally any eigenstate) of the network Hamiltonian, with a similar training mechanism that exploits the fact that the mean energy is extremal on eigenstates. Second we extend the analysis of equilibrium propagation at finite temperature, showing that thermal fluctuations allow one to naturally train the network without having to clamp the output layer during training. We also study the low temperature limit of equilibrium propagation.</description>

      <title>A practical transmitter device for passive state BB84 quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution systems, careful preparation of quantum states within the transmitter device is a significant driver of both complexity and cost. Moreover, the security guarantees of such systems rest on the correct operation of high speed quantum random number generators (QRNGs) and the high-fidelity modulation of weak optical signals by high-speed optoelectronic devices, all of which must be hardened against a variety of known side-channel attacks.
  A fully passive state preparation approach elegantly resolves these problems by combining state preparation and QRNG stages into a single optical instrument. By using pairs of optical pulses from a gain-switched laser diode as ready-to-use qubits, the QKD transmitter can be radically simplified, eventually comprising a single laser and local phase tomography stage. We demonstrate our simplified transmitter by establishing a QKD link over a 10 km fiber, generating a secret key rate 110 bits/s, sufficient for practical deployment in "last mile" urban quantum networks. Our results show promise in making QKD simpler and more accessible, closing a critical technology gap in building a secure quantum communication infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Universal replication of chaotic characteristics by classical and quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replicating chaotic characteristics of non-linear dynamics by machine learning (ML) has recently drawn wide attentions. In this work, we propose that a ML model, trained to predict the state one-step-ahead from several latest historic states, can accurately replicate the bifurcation diagram and the Lyapunov exponents of discrete dynamic systems. The characteristics for different values of the hyper-parameters are captured universally by a single ML model, while the previous works considered training the ML model independently by fixing the hyper-parameters to be specific values. Our benchmarks on the one- and two-dimensional Logistic maps show that variational quantum circuit can reproduce the long-term characteristics with higher accuracy than the long short-term memory (a well-recognized classical ML model). Our work reveals an essential difference between the ML for the chaotic characteristics and that for standard tasks, from the perspective of the relation between performance and model complexity. Our results suggest that quantum circuit model exhibits potential advantages on mitigating over-fitting, achieving higher accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance of the Aharonov-Bohm effect in a quantum electrodynamics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge invariance of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect with a quantum treatment for the electromagnetic field is demonstrated. We provide an exact solution for the electromagnetic ground energy due to the interaction of the quantum electromagnetic field with the classical charges and currents that act as sources of the potentials in a classical description, in the Lorenz gauge. Then, we use first-order perturbation theory to compute an extra change on the electromagnetic ground energy due to the presence of a quantum charged particle with known wave function in the system. This energy in general depends on the quantum particle path in an interferometer, what results in an AB phase difference between the paths. The gauge invariance of this AB phase difference is then shown for the magnetic, electric, and the recently proposed electrodynamic versions of the AB effect. However, the AB phase difference could depend on the gauge for nonclosed paths, what reinforces the view that it only can be measured in closed paths.</description>

      <title>Generating quantum dissonance via local operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations may arise in quantum systems through various means, of which the most remarkable one is quantum entanglement. Additionally, there are systems that exhibit non-classical correlations even in the absence of entanglement. Quantum dissonance refers to how quantum discord (QD) -- the difference between the total correlation and the classical correlation in a given quantum state -- appears as a non-classical correlation in a system without entanglement. It could be said that QD has the potential to provide a more inclusive viewpoint for discerning the non-classical correlations. In this work, we address the problem of manipulating the QD between two subsystems through local operations. We propose two explicit procedures for obtaining separable Werner states, a type of mixed state with nonzero QD. Both approaches involve performing local operations on classically correlated states and offers a step-by-step method for obtaining separable Werner states with nonzero discord, providing an alternative (explicit and user-friendly) to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a spinning microwave magnonic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose how to achieve nonreciprocal quantum phase transition in a spinning microwave magnonic system composed of a spinning microwave resonator coupled with an yttrium iron garnet sphere with magnon Kerr effect. Sagnac-Fizeau shift caused by the spinning of the resonator brings about a significant modification in the critical driving strengths for second- and one-order quantum phase transitions, which means that the highly controllable quantum phase can be realized by the spinning speed of the resonator. More importantly, based on the difference in the detunings of the counterclockwise and clockwise modes induced by spinning direction of the resonator, the phase transition in this system is nonreciprocal, that is, the quantum phase transition occurs when the system is driven in one direction but not the other. Our work offers an alternative path to engineer and design nonreciprocal magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Sharing Quantum Steering via Standard Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for the sharing of quantum steering among three observers, Alice, Bob, and Charlie using standard projective measurements. We show that in the unilateral sequential scenario, Alice can steer Bob's and Charlie's states and conversely, Bob and Charlie can steer Alice's state. Unlike the quantum steering sharing achieved through weak measurements, we use the standard projective measurements to enable quantum steering sharing. Quantum steering is demonstrated by the violations of the linear steering inequality among different observer combinations. We find that Alice can simultaneously steer both Bob's and Charlie's states, and Bob and Charlie can simultaneously steer Alice's state, regardless of whether they are in maximally entangled states or partially entangled states. The maximum double violation of the linear steering inequalities obtained from partially entangled states can be greater in some cases than that obtained from maximally entangled states when randomly combining the case of two projective measurements and the case of two identity measurements. Additionally, we verify hybrid quantum correlation sharing through the double violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality and the linear steering inequality. Our results provide a new perspective for the study of quantum steering and may lead to applications in quantum random access code, randomness certification, and self-testing process.</description>

      <title>The Bell Based Super Coherent States. Uncertainty Relations, Golden Ratio and Fermion-Boson Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of maximally fermion-boson entangled Bell super-coherent states is introduced. A superposition of these states with separable bosonic coherent states, represented by points on the super-Bloch sphere, we call the Bell based super-coherent states. Entanglement of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in these states is studied by using displacement bosonic operator. It acts on the super-qubit reference state, representing superposition of the zero and the one super-number states, forming computational basis super-states. We show that the states are completely characterized by displaced Fock states, as a superposition with non-classical, the photon added coherent states, and the entanglement is independent of coherent state parameter $\alpha$ and of the time evolution. In contrast to never orthogonal Glauber coherent states, our entangled super-coherent states can be orthogonal. The uncertainty relation in the states is monotonically growing function of the concurrence and for entangled states we get non-classical quadrature squeezing and representation of uncertainty by ratio of two Fibonacci numbers. The sequence of concurrences, and corresponding uncertainties $\hbar F_n/F_{n+1}$, in the limit $n \rightarrow \infty $, convergent to the Golden ratio uncertainty $\hbar/\varphi$, where $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ is found.</description>

      <title>Gamma-protocol for secure transmission of information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure communication that allows only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its content has a long history. Quantum objects, such as single photons are ideal carriers for secure information transmission because, according to the no-cloning theorem [1], it is impossible to create an identical and independent copy of an arbitrary quantum state while its detection leads to the information distortion. BB84 [2,3] is the first quantum cryptography protocol for a quantum key generation and distribution, based on single photon sources. This quantum key is used for coding and decoding of classical information. We propose completely different protocol based on a stochastic decay of an ensemble of radioactive nuclei randomly emitting a stream of gamma-photons. We experimentally demonstrate a method how to transmit classical information containing binary bits (0 or 1) with the help of this stream. Transmission is organized such that eavesdropping is impossible since the presence of information in the stream of randomly emitted gamma-photons can be hidden. Reading of this information needs precise knowledge of the repetition rate of its sending in advance. It is unrealistic for the eavesdropper to disclose this rate, and without knowledge of this parameter it is impossible to make the transmitted information visible.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the relative effects of connectivity and coupling interactions on spin networks emulating the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From available data, we show strong positive spatial correlations in the qubits of a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing chip that are connected to qubits outside their own unit cell. Then, by simulating the dynamics of three different spin networks and two different initial conditions, we then show that correlation between nodes is affected by a number of factors. The different connectivity of qubits within the network means that information transfer is not straightforward even when all the qubit-qubit couplings have equal weighting. Connected nodes behave even more dissimilarly when the couplings' strength is scaled according to the physical length of the connections (here to simulate dipole-dipole interactions). This highlights the importance of understanding the architectural features and potentially unprogrammed interactions/connections that can divert the performance of a quantum system away from the idealised model of identical qubits and couplings across the chip.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) is undergoing a high rate of development, investment and research devoted to its improvement.However, there is little consensus in the industry and wider literature as to what improvement might consist of beyond ambiguous statements of "more qubits" and "fewer errors". Before one can decide how to improve something, it is first necessary to define the criteria for success: what are the metrics or statistics that are relevant to the problem? The lack of clarity surrounding this question has led to a rapidly developing capability with little consistency or standards present across the board. This paper lays out a framework by which any user, developer or researcher can define, articulate and justify the success criteria and associated benchmarks that have been used to solve their problem or make their claim.</description>

      <title>Beyond Quantum Annealing: Optimal control solutions to MaxCut problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) relies on mixing two Hamiltonian terms, a simple driver and a complex problem Hamiltonian, in a linear combination. The time-dependent schedule for this mixing is often taken to be linear in time: improving on this linear choice is known to be essential and has proven to be difficult. Here, we present different techniques for improving on the linear-schedule QA along two directions, conceptually distinct but leading to similar outcomes: 1) the first approach consists of constructing a Trotter-digitized QA (dQA) with schedules parameterized in terms of Fourier modes or Chebyshev polynomials, inspired by the Chopped Random Basis algorithm (CRAB) for optimal control in continuous time; 2) the second approach is technically a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), whose solutions are found iteratively using linear interpolation or expansion in Fourier modes. Both approaches emphasize finding smooth optimal schedule parameters, ultimately leading to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms of the alternating Hamiltonian Ansatz type. We apply these techniques to MaxCut problems on weighted 3-regular graphs with N = 14 sites, focusing on hard instances that exhibit a small spectral gap, for which a standard linear-schedule QA performs poorly. We characterize the physics behind the optimal protocols for both the dQA and QAOA approaches, discovering shortcuts to adiabaticity-like dynamics. Furthermore, we study the transferability of such smooth solutions among hard instances of MaxCut at different circuit depths. Finally, we show that the smoothness pattern of these protocols obtained in a digital setting enables us to adapt them to continuous-time evolution, contrarily to generic non-smooth solutions. This procedure results in an optimized quantum annealing schedule that is implementable on analog devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Model for Lattice Boltzmann Fluid Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present contribution, we propose a quantum computational algorithm for the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) to solve fluid flow equations in the low Reynolds number ($Re$) regime. Firstly, we express the LBM collision and streaming operators in matrix form. Since quantum logic gates are typically expressed as unitary matrices, we first decompose LBM operations as a product of unitaries. The particle distribution functions (PDFs) of LBM are encoded as probability amplitudes of the quantum state. We have observed that the amplitudes in the state vector (SV) can be affected: (i) by the choice of encoding the PDFs during the quantum state preparation or (ii) when collision is followed by streaming, as in classical LBM implementation. In the first case, we show that the ancilla qubit must be in superposition with the compute qubits during the quantum state preparation. The superposition allows the SV to utilize the increased Hilbert space offered by the ancilla qubit rather than placing the ancilla in a separate register, which restricts the space of possible outcomes. Next, we show that the second issue can be resolved by having an intermediate Hadamard gate before the streaming operation. The proposed algorithm has been tested through typical benchmark problems like advection-diffusion of a Gaussian hill, Poiseuille flow, Couette flow, and the lid-driven cavity problem. The results are validated with the respective analytic or reference solutions. Translating the unitaries into quantum gates (circuit synthesis) presents a primary challenge, as a unitary matrix can be decomposed in multiple ways. We report on the CNOT and U gate counts obtained for the test cases with the range of qubits from 9 to 12. Although the gate count closely agrees with the theoretical limit, the number of two qubit gates is in the $O(10^7)$ prompts special attention to circuit synthesis.</description>

      <title>Learning How to Dynamically Decouple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum computers suffer from noise that stems from interactions between the quantum system that constitutes the quantum device and its environment. These interactions can be suppressed through dynamical decoupling to reduce computational errors. However, the performance of dynamical decoupling depends on the type of the system-environment interactions that are present, which often lack an accurate model in quantum devices. We show that the performance of dynamical decoupling can be improved by optimizing its rotational gates to tailor them to the quantum hardware. We find that compared to canonical decoupling sequences, such as CPMG and XY4, the optimized dynamical decoupling sequences yield the best performance in suppressing noise in superconducting qubits. Our work thus enhances existing error suppression methods which helps increase circuit depth and result quality on noisy hardware.</description>

      <title>Calculating response functions of coupled oscillators using quantum phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating frequency response functions of systems of coupled, classical harmonic oscillators using a quantum computer. The functional form of these response functions can be mapped to a corresponding eigenproblem of a Hermitian matrix $H$, thus suggesting the use of quantum phase estimation. Our proposed quantum algorithm operates in the standard $s$-sparse, oracle-based query access model. For a network of $N$ oscillators with maximum norm $\lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}$, and when the eigenvalue tolerance $\varepsilon$ is much smaller than the minimum eigenvalue gap, we use $\mathcal{O}(\log(N s \lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}/\varepsilon)$ algorithmic qubits and obtain a rigorous worst-case query complexity upper bound $\mathcal{O}(s \lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}/(\delta^2 \varepsilon) )$ up to logarithmic factors, where $\delta$ denotes the desired precision on the coefficients appearing in the response functions. Crucially, our proposal does not suffer from the infamous state preparation bottleneck and can as such potentially achieve large quantum speedups compared to relevant classical methods. As a proof-of-principle of exponential quantum speedup, we show that a simple adaptation of our algorithm solves the random glued-trees problem in polynomial time. We discuss practical limitations as well as potential improvements for quantifying finite size, end-to-end complexities for application to relevant instances.</description>

      <title>Generalized energy gap law: An open system dynamics approach to non-adiabatic phenomena in molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic molecular phenomena, arising from the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, govern the fate of virtually all photo-physical and photochemical processes and limit the quantum efficiency of molecules and other solid-state embedded quantum emitters. A simple and elegant description, the energy gap law, was derived five decades ago, predicting that the non-adiabatic coupling between the excited and ground potential landscapes lead to non-radiative decay with a quasi-exponential dependence on the energy gap. We revisit and extend this theory to account for crucial aspects such as vibrational relaxation, dephasing, and radiative loss. We find a closed analytical solution with general validity which indicates a direct proportionality of the non-radiative rate with the vibrational relaxation rate at low temperatures, and with the dephasing rate of the electronic transition at high temperatures. Our work establishes a connection between nanoscale quantum optics, open quantum system dynamics and non-adiabatic molecular physics.</description>

      <title>Robust self-testing of Bell inequalities tilted for maximal loophole-free nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of experimentally attainable nonlocality, as gauged by the amount of loophole-free violation of Bell inequalities, remains severely limited due to inefficient detectors. We address an experimentally motivated question: Which quantum strategies attain the maximal loophole-free nonlocality in the presence of inefficient detectors? For any Bell inequality and any specification of detection efficiencies, the optimal strategies are those that maximally violate a tilted version of the Bell inequality in ideal conditions. In the simplest scenario, we demonstrate that the quantum strategies that maximally violate the tilted versions of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality are unique up to local isometries. However, self-testing via the standard sum of squares decomposition method turns out to be analytically intractable since even high levels of the Navascu\'es--Pironio--Ac\'in hierarchy are insufficient to saturate the maximum quantum violation of these inequalities. Instead, we utilize a novel Jordan's lemma-based proof technique to obtain robust analytical self-testing statements for the entire family of tilted-Bell inequalities. These results allow us to unveil intriguing aspects of the effect of inefficient detectors and the complexity of characterizing the set of quantum correlations, in the simplest Bell scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Through the Lens of Paraconsistent Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an alternative approach to quantum entanglement, one that effectively resolves the logical inconsistencies without leading to logical contradictions. By addressing some of the inconsistencies within quantum mechanics, such as state superposition and non-locality, that challenge classical causal explanations, our method is constructed on the principles of paraconsistent logic. Our aim is to develop a para-consistent framework that supports the features of quantum mechanics while remaining faithful to its fundamental principles. In this pursuit, we scrutinize the philosophical and mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics in relation to classical logic systems. This method is designed to untangle theoretical puzzle spaces and promote coherence in the discussion of quantum theory. Ultimately, our approach offers a potential solution for interpreting quantum mechanics in a more coherent manner.</description>

      <title>Prospects of Privacy Advantage in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring data privacy in machine learning models is critical, particularly in distributed settings where model gradients are typically shared among multiple parties to allow collaborative learning. Motivated by the increasing success of recovering input data from the gradients of classical models, this study addresses a central question: How hard is it to recover the input data from the gradients of quantum machine learning models? Focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQC) as learning models, we uncover the crucial role played by the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) of the VQC ansatz in determining privacy vulnerabilities. While the DLA has previously been linked to the classical simulatability and trainability of VQC models, this work, for the first time, establishes its connection to the privacy of VQC models. In particular, we show that properties conducive to the trainability of VQCs, such as a polynomial-sized DLA, also facilitate the extraction of detailed snapshots of the input. We term this a weak privacy breach, as the snapshots enable training VQC models for distinct learning tasks without direct access to the original input. Further, we investigate the conditions for a strong privacy breach where the original input data can be recovered from these snapshots by classical or quantum-assisted polynomial time methods. We establish conditions on the encoding map such as classical simulatability, overlap with DLA basis, and its Fourier frequency characteristics that enable such a privacy breach of VQC models. Our findings thus play a crucial role in detailing the prospects of quantum privacy advantage by guiding the requirements for designing quantum machine learning models that balance trainability with robust privacy protection.</description>

Abstract: We describe Qiskit, a software development kit for quantum information science. We discuss the key design decisions that have shaped its development, and examine the software architecture and its core components. We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for solving a problem in condensed matter physics on a quantum computer that serves to highlight some of Qiskit's capabilities, for example the representation and optimization of circuits at various abstraction levels, its scalability and retargetability to new gates, and the use of quantum-classical computations via dynamic circuits. Lastly, we discuss some of the ecosystem of tools and plugins that extend Qiskit for various tasks, and the future ahead.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Matter-Wave Quantum Emitters in a Structured Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.02816v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characteristics of spontaneous emission can be strongly modified by the mode structure of the vacuum. In waveguide quantum-electrodynamics based on photonic crystals, this modification is exploited to engineer atom-photon interactions near a band edge, but the physics of coupling to an entire band has not yet been explored in experiments. Using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, we study the decay dynamics of matter-wave quantum emitters coupled to a single band of an effective photonic crystal waveguide structure with tunable characteristics. Depending on the ratio between vacuum coupling and bandwidth, we observe a transition from irreversible decay to fully oscillatory dynamics linked to the interplay of matter-wave bound states near the band edges, whose spatial structure we characterize. Our results shed light on the emergence of coherence in an open quantum system in a controllable environment, and are of relevance for the understanding of vacuum-induced decay phenomena in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Doppler sensitivity and resonant tuning of Rydberg atom-based antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency antennas based on Rydberg atom vapor cells can in principle reach sensitivities beyond those of any wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where long wires are needed to accommodate a growing wavelength. They also have other desirable features such as nonmetallic, lower profile, elements. This paper presents a detailed theoretical investigation of Rydberg antenna sensitivity, elucidating parameter regimes that could cumulatively lead to 2--3 orders of magnitude sensitivity increase beyond that of currently tested configurations. The key insight is to optimally combine the advantages of two well-studied approaches: (i) three laser ``2D star configuration'' setups that, enhanced also with increased laser power, help compensate for atom motion-induced Doppler broadening, and (ii) resonant coupling between a pair of near-degenerate Rydberg levels, tuned via a local oscillator to the incident signal. The advantage of the star setup is subtle because it only restores overall sensitivity to the expected Doppler-limited value, compensating for additional off-resonance reductions where differently moving atom populations destructively interfere with each other in the net signal. The additional unique advantage of the local oscillator tuning is that it leads to vastly narrower line widths, as low as ~10 kHz set by the intrinsic Rydberg state lifetimes, rather than the typical ~10 MHz set by the core state lifetimes. Intuitively, with this setup the two Rydberg states may be tuned to act as an independent high-q cavity, a point of view supported through a study of the frequency-dependence of the antenna resonant response. There are a number of practical experimental advances, especially larger ~1 cm laser beam widths, required to suppress various extrinsic line broadening effects and to fully exploit this cavity response.</description>

      <title>An Area Law for Entanglement Entropy in Particle Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering cross section is the effective area of collision when two particles collide. Quantum mechanically, it is a measure of the probability for a specific process to take place. Employing wave packets to describe the scattering process, we compute the entanglement entropy in 2-to-2 scattering of particles in a general setting using the $S$-matrix formalism. Applying the optical theorem, we show that the linear entropy $\mathcal{E}_2$ is given by the elastic cross section $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ in unit of the transverse size $L^2$ of the wave packet, $\mathcal{E}_2 \sim \sigma_{\text{el}}/L^2$, when the initial states are not entangled. The result allows for dual interpretations of the entanglement entropy as an area and as a probability. Since $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ is generally believed, and observed experimentally, to grow with the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ in the high energy regime, the result suggests a "second law" of entanglement entropy for high energy collisions. Furthermore, the Froissart bound places an upper limit on the entropy growth.</description>

      <title>Quantised helicity in optical media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical helicity quantifies the handedness of light, and plays a central role in the description of interactions between light and chiral matter. In free space, it is related to the duality symmetry of the electromagnetic field, a continuous symmetry encapsulating the invariance of Maxwell's equations under the interchange of electric and magnetic fields. However, in materials the situation is not so straightforward, as the free space transformation must be extended to encompass mixing of both the $\mathbf{E}$/$\mathbf{H}$ and $\mathbf{D}$/$\mathbf{B}$ field pairs. The simultaneous direct interchange of $\mathbf{E}$/$\mathbf{H}$ and of $\mathbf{D}$/$\mathbf{B}$ is incompatible with the presence of linear constitutive relations. In this work, we extend the duality transform in a way that resolves this incompatibility, and use this to define the optical helicity in a general medium, which may be dispersive, lossy, chiral or nonreciprocal. We find that the helicity density must contain an explicit contribution associated with the polarisation and magnetisation of the matter, and we show that the form of this matter contribution is independent of the details of the medium. We also show that the in-medium helicity can be naturally expressed in terms of the elementary quantised excitations of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indistinguishable single photons in the telecom-bandwidth of optical fibers are indispensable for long-distance quantum communication. Solid-state single photon emitters have achieved excellent performance in key benchmarks, however, the demonstration of indistinguishability at room-temperature remains a major challenge. Here, we report room-temperature photon indistinguishability at telecom wavelengths from individual nanotube defects in a fiber-based microcavity operated in the regime of incoherent good cavity-coupling. The efficiency of the coupled system outperforms spectral or temporal filtering, and the photon indistinguishability is increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the free-space limit. Our results highlight a promising strategy to attain optimized non-classical light sources.</description>

      <title>Global anomalies of Green's function zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies in systems with symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy, described by nonlocal effective theories. We view the nonlocal effective theories as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomalies, we discuss the simplest Lagrangian describing a gapless Dirac zero and a two-pole variant, their global anomalies, and the bulk-boundary correspondence. We then consider the constraints on possible phases with Green's function zeros of Dirac type, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory discussed by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <title>Coherence of multipartite quantum states in the black hole quantum atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the recently introduced concept of quantum atmosphere, the black hole radiation is suggested to originate from the quantum excitations at the effective distance ($r$) near the event horizon ($r_H$). Here, this concept is explored from the quantum resource perspective by analysing the coherence of multipartite quantum systems located near a black hole. For the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, it is found that signatures of the atmosphere are apparent. This is to say, the coherence exhibits peak close to the event horizon and next decreases, recovering conventional behavior at $r/r_H \rightarrow\infty$. Interestingly, it is shown that as the quantum state gets more complex and the number of parties increases, the role of quantum atmosphere diminishes and the standard behaviour expected for the $N$-partite coherence quantifiers can be observed. That means, in case of complex setups the quantum atmosphere signatures may not be detectable. Hence, our findings show that care should be taken, regarding size of a system, when quantum atmosphere argument is considered.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hertz action and quantum criticality of two-dimensional Fermi systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reassess the structure of the effective action and quantum critical singularities of two-dimensional Fermi systems characterized by the ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}= \vec{0}$. By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Relaxometry of Hemoglobin by Widefield Nitrogen-Vacancy Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hemoglobin (Hb) is a multifaceted protein, classified as a metalloprotein, chromoprotein, and globulin. It incorporates iron, which plays a crucial role in transporting oxygen within red blood cells. Hb functions by carrying oxygen from the respiratory organs to diverse tissues in the body, where it releases oxygen to fuel aerobic respiration, thus supporting the organism's metabolic processes. Deviations in Hb concentration in the blood have been linked to various medical conditions, including anemia and other blood disorders. Here, we use optical detected magnetic relaxometry of paramagnetic iron spins in Hb drop-casted onto nanostructured diamond doped with shallow (~ 5.5 nm) high density nitrogen vacancy (NV) spin qubits. We modify the Hb concentration in the range of 6 x 10^6 to 1.8 x 10^7 adsorbed Fe+3 spins per um^2 and observe an increase of the NV relaxation rate G1 (= 1/ T1, T1 is NV spin lattice relaxation time) up to 2 x 10^3 s^-1. NV magnetic relaxometry of Hb in phosphate-buffered saline solution show a similar effect with an increase of G1 to 6.7 x 10^3 s^-1 upon increasing the Hb concentration to 100 uM. The increase of NV G1 is explained by the increased spin noise coming from the Fe+3 spins present in Hb proteins. This study presents an additional usage of NV quantum sensors to detect paramagnetic centers in biomolecules.</description>

      <title>From the Quantum Breakdown Model to the Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional quantum breakdown model, which features spatially asymmetric fermionic interactions simulating the electrical breakdown phenomenon, exhibits an exponential U(1) symmetry and a variety of dynamical phases including many-body localization and quantum chaos with quantum scar states. We investigate the minimal quantum breakdown model with the minimal number of on-site fermion orbitals required for the interaction, and identify a large number of local conserved charges in the model. We then reveal a mapping between the minimal quantum breakdown model in certain charge sectors and a quantum link model which simulates the $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, and show that the local conserved charges map to the gauge symmetry generators. A special charge sector of the model further maps to the PXP model, which shows quantum many-body scars. This mapping unveils the rich dynamics in different Krylov subspaces characterized by different gauge configurations in the quantum breakdown model.</description>

      <title>Vacuum currents in curved tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of spatial curvature and topology on the properties of the vacuum state for a charged scalar field localized on rotationally symmetric 2D curved tubes. For a general spatial geometry and for quasiperiodicity condition with a general phase, the representation of the Hadamard function is provided where the topological contribution is explicitly extracted. As an important local characteristic of the vacuum state the expectation value of the current density is studied. The vacuum current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by the tube with the period of flux quantum. The general formula is specified for constant radius and conical tubes. As another application, we consider the Hadamard function and the vacuum current density for a scalar field on the Beltrami pseudosphere. Several representations are provided for the corresponding expectation value. For small values of the proper radius of the tube, compared with the curvature radius, the effect of spatial curvature on the vacuum current is weak and the leading term in the corresponding expansion coincides with the current density on a constant radius tube. The effect of curvature is essential for proper radii of the tube larger than the radius of spatial curvature. In this limit the fall-off of the current density, as a function of the proper radius, follows a power-law for both massless and massive fields. This behavior is in clear contrast to the one for a constant radius tube with exponential decay for massive fields. We also compare the vacuum currents on the Beltrami pseudosphere and on locally de Sitter and anti-de Sitter 2D tubes.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing bounce and inflation via quantum signatures from cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological inflation is a popular paradigm for understanding Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR); however, it faces many conceptual challenges. An alternative mechanism to inflation for generating an almost scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations is a \emph{bouncing cosmology} with an initial matter-dominated contraction phase, during which the modes corresponding to currently observed scales exited the Hubble radius. Bouncing cosmology avoids the initial singularity but has fine-tuning problems. Taking an \emph{agnostic view} of the two early-universe paradigms, we propose a quantum measure -- Dynamical Fidelity Susceptibility (DFS) of CMBR -- that distinguishes the two scenarios. Taking two simple models with the same power-spectrum, we explicitly show that DFS behaves differently for the two scenarios. We discuss the possibility of using DFS as a distinguisher in the upcoming space missions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Beats of a Multiexciton State in Rubrene Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe quantum beats in the nanosecond-scale photoluminescence decay of rubrene single crystals after photoexcitation with short laser pulses in a magnetic field of 0.1 to 0.3 T. The relative amplitude of the quantum beats is of the order of 5\%. Their frequency is $1.3$ GHz when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the two-fold rotation axis of the rubrene molecules and decreases to $0.6$ GHz when the magnetic field is rotated to the crystal's molecular stacking direction. The amplitude of the quantum beats decays alongside the non-oscillatory photoluminescence background, which at low excitation densities has an exponential decay time of $ 4.0 \pm 0.2$~ns. We interpret this as the effective lifetime of a multiexciton state that originates from singlet-fission and can undergo geminate recombination back to the singlet state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative description of the thermalization dynamics of far-from-equilibrium, two-dimensional (2D) Bose superfluids. Our analysis leverages a quantum kinetic formalism and allows us to identify two successive regimes of relaxation: an initial damping of quasi-particles due to Landau scattering processes, followed by the slower establishment of a global equilibrium at long time. For a far-from-equilibrium initial state, we find that Landau damping differs from the conventional picture of exponentially relaxing quasi-particles. Moreover, our results showcase a pronounced mechanism of algebraic transport at late times, rooted in energy conservation and compatible with 2D diffusion. Using theoretical and numerical arguments, we construct a detailed dynamical portrait of global equilibration in 2D superfluids.</description>

Abstract: We study the Birman-Schwinger operator for a self-adjoint realisation of the one-dimensional Hamiltonian with the Coulomb potential. We study both the case in which this Hamiltonian is defined on the whole real line and when it is only defined on the positive semiaxis. In both cases, the Birman-Schwinger operator is Hilbert-Schmidt, even though it is not trace class. Then, we have considered some approximations to the Hamiltonian depending on a positive parameter, under given conditions, and proved the convergence of the Birman-Schwinger operators of these approximations to the original Hamiltonian as the parameter goes to zero. Further comments and results have been included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional electron gas interacting with a quantized cavity mode. We find that the coupling between the electrons and the photons in the cavity enhances the superconducting gap. Crucially, all terms in the Peierls phase are kept, in contrast to more naive approaches, which may result in spurious superradiant phase transitions. We use a mean-field theory to show that the gap increases approximately linearly with the cavity coupling strength. The effect can be observed locally as an increase in the gap size via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements for a flake of a 2D material (or for a Moir\'e system where the enhancement is expected to be more pronounced due to a large lattice constant) interacting with a locally-structured electromagnetic field formed by split-ring resonators. Our results are also relevant for quantum optics setups with cold atoms interacting with the cavity mode, where the lattice geometry and system parameters can be tuned in a vast range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) in the symmetry-reduced cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe driven by a quintessence scalar field with potential. Our study focuses on semi-classical regime. In particular, we derive the GUP-distorted Friedmann, Raychaudhuri, and the Klein-Gordon equation. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the qualitative dynamics for the choice of potential $V(\phi)= V_0 \sinh^{-n}{(\mu \phi)}$. This involves constructing an autonomous dynamical system of equations by choosing appropriate dynamical variables, followed by a qualitative study using linear stability theory. Our analysis shows that incorporating GUP significantly changes the existing fixed points compared to the limiting case without quantum effects by switching off the GUP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between nontrivial band topology and layered antiferromagnetism in MnBi2Te4 has opened up a new avenue for exploring topological phases of matter. Representative examples include the quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator state observed in odd and even number layers of MnBi2Te4, when the top and bottom surfaces have parallel and antiparallel spin alignments respectively. The rich and complex spin dynamics associated with the van der Waals antiferromagnetic order is expected to generate novel topological phases and phase transitions that are unique to MnBi2Te4. Here we fabricate a device of 7-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 covered with AlOx capping layer, which enables the investigation of antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect over wide parameter spaces. By tuning the gate voltage and perpendicular magnetic field, we uncover a cascade of quantum phase transitions that can be attributed to the influence of spin configurations on charge transport. Furthermore, we find that an in-plane magnetic field enhances both the coercive field and exchange gap of the surface state, in sharp contrast to that in ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall state. We propose that these peculiar features arise from the spin flip and flop transitions inherent to van der Waals antiferromagnet. The versatile tunability of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in MnBi2Te4 paves the way for potential applications in topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Extending Non-Perturbative Simulation Techniques for Open-Quantum Systems to Excited-State Proton Transfer and Ultrafast Non-Adiabatic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited state proton transfer is an ubiquitous phenomenon in biology and chemistry, spanning from the ultrafast reactions of photo-bases and acids to light-driven, enzymatic catalysis and photosynthesis. However, the simulation of such dynamics involves multiple challenges, since high-dimensional, out-of-equilibrium vibronic states play a crucial role, while a fully quantum description of the proton's dissipative, real-space dynamics is also required. In this work, we extend the powerful Matrix Product State approach to open quantum systems (TEDOPA) to study these demanding dynamics, and also more general non-adiabatic processes that can appear in complex photochemistry subject to strong laser driving. As an illustration, we initially consider an open model of a four-level electronic system interacting with hundreds of intramolecular vibrations that drive ultrafast excited state proton transfer, as well as an explicit photonic environment that allows us to directly monitor the resulting dual fluorescence in this system. We then demonstrate how to include a continuous 'reaction coordinate' of the proton transfer that allows numerically exact simulations that can be understood, visualized and interpreted in the familiar language of diabatic and adiabatic dynamics on potential surfaces, while also retaining an exact quantum treatment of dissipation and driving effects that could be used to study diverse problems in ultrafast photochemistry.</description>

Abstract: The Bohr and von Neumann views on the measurement process in quantum mechanics have been interpreted for a long time in somewhat controversial terms, often leading to misconceptions. On the basis of some textual analysis, I would like to show that, contrary to a widespread opinion, their views should be taken less inconsistent, and much closer to each other, than usually thought. As a consequence, I claim that Bohr and von Neumann are conceptually on the same side on the issue of the universality of quantum mechanics: hopefully, this might contribute to a more accurate history of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function gives access to one-body observables for quantum systems. Of particular interest are quantities such as density, currents, and absorption spectra which are important for interpreting experimental results in quantum transport and spectroscopy. We present an integration scheme for the Green's function's equations of motion, the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE), which is both adaptive in the time integrator step size and method order as well as the history integration order. We analyze the importance of solving the KBE self-consistently and show that adapting the order of history integral evaluation is important for obtaining accurate results. To examine the efficiency of our method, we compare runtimes to a state of the art fixed time step integrator for several test systems and show an order of magnitude speedup at similar levels of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Performance of wave function and Green's functions based methods for non equilibrium many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</description>

      <title>General quantum correlation from nonreal values of Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability over orthonormal product bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a characterization and a quantification of general quantum correlation which is exhibited even by a separable (unentangled) mixed bipartite state in terms of the nonclassical values of the associated Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability. Such a general quantum correlation, wherein entanglement is a subset, is not only intriguing from a fundamental point of view, but it has also been recognized as a resource in a variety of schemes of quantum information processing and quantum technology. Given a bipartite state, we construct a quantity based on the imaginary part the associated KD quasiprobability defined over a pair of orthonormal product bases and an optimization procedure over all pairs of such bases. We show that it satisfies certain requirements expected for a quantifier of general quantum correlations. It gives a lower bound to the total sum of the quantum standard deviation of all the elements of the product (local) basis, minimized over all such bases. It suggests an interpretation as the minimum genuine quantum share of uncertainty in all possible local von-Neumann projective measurement. Moreover, it is a faithful witness for entanglement and measurement-induced nonlocality of pure bipartite states. We then discuss a variational scheme for its estimation, and based on this, we offer information theoretical meanings of the general quantum correlation. Our results suggest a deep connection between the general quantum correlation and the nonclassical values of the KD quasiprobability and the associated strange weak values.</description>

      <title>On Locality of Quantum Information in the Heisenberg Picture for Arbitrary States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The locality issue of quantum mechanics is a key issue to a proper understanding of quantum physics and beyond. What has been commonly emphasized as quantum nonlocality has received an inspiring examination through the notion of Heisenberg picture of quantum information. Deutsch and Hayden established a local description of quantum information in a setting of quantum information flow in a system of qubits. With the introduction of a slightly modified version of what we call the Deutsch-Hayden matrix values of observables, together with our recently introduced parallel notion of the noncommutative values from a more fundamental perspective, we clarify all the locality issues based on such values as quantum information carried by local observables in any given arbitrary state of a generic composite system. Quantum information as the {\em `quantum' values} of observables gives a transparent conceptual picture of all the. Spatial locality for a projective measurement is also discussed. The pressing question is if and how such information for an entangled system can be retrieved through local processes which can only be addressed with new experimental thinking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the macroscopic world, time is intrinsically asymmetric, flowing in a specific direction, from past to future. However, the same is not necessarily true for quantum systems, as some quantum processes produce valid quantum evolutions under time reversal. Supposing that such processes can be probed in both time directions, we can also consider quantum processes probed in a coherent superposition of forwards and backwards time directions. This yields a broader class of quantum processes than the ones considered so far in the literature, including those with indefinite causal order. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time an operation belonging to this new class: the quantum time flip. Using a photonic realisation of this operation, we apply it to a game formulated as a discrimination task between two sets of operators. This game not only serves as a witness of an indefinite time direction, but also allows for a computational advantage over strategies using a fixed time direction, and even those with an indefinite causal order.</description>

      <title>A new twist on the Majorana surface code: Bosonic and fermionic defects for fault-tolerant quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are promising candidates for topologically-protected quantum computing hardware, however their large-scale use will likely require quantum error correction. Majorana surface codes (MSCs) have been proposed to achieve this. However, many MSC properties remain unexplored. We present a unified framework for MSC "twist defects" $\unicode{x2013}$ anyon-like objects encoding quantum information. We show that twist defects in MSCs can encode twice the amount of topologically protected information as in qubit-based codes or other MSC encoding schemes. This is due to twists encoding both logical qubits and "logical MZMs," with the latter enhancing the protection microscopic MZMs can offer. We explain how to perform universal computation with logical qubits and logical MZMs while potentially using far fewer resources than in other MSC schemes. All Clifford gates can be implemented on logical qubits by braiding twist defects. We introduce lattice-surgery-based techniques for computing with logical MZMs and logical qubits, achieving the effect of Clifford gates with zero time overhead. We also show that logical MZMs may result in improved spatial overheads for sufficiently low rates of quasi-particle poisoning. Finally, we introduce a novel MSC analogue of transversal gates that achieves encoded Clifford gates in small codes by braiding microscopic MZMs. MSC twist defects thus open new paths towards fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Sample-optimal classical shadows for pure states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical shadows task for pure states in the setting of both joint and independent measurements. The task is to measure few copies of an unknown pure state $\rho$ in order to learn a classical description which suffices to later estimate expectation values of observables. Specifically, the goal is to approximate $\mathrm{Tr}(O \rho)$ for any Hermitian observable $O$ to within additive error $\epsilon$ provided $\mathrm{Tr}(O^2)\leq B$ and $\lVert O \rVert = 1$. Our main result applies to the joint measurement setting, where we show $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{B}\epsilon^{-1} + \epsilon^{-2})$ samples of $\rho$ are necessary and sufficient to succeed with high probability. The upper bound is a quadratic improvement on the previous best sample complexity known for this problem. For the lower bound, we see that the bottleneck is not how fast we can learn the state but rather how much any classical description of $\rho$ can be compressed for observable estimation. In the independent measurement setting, we show that $\mathcal O(\sqrt{Bd} \epsilon^{-1} + \epsilon^{-2})$ samples suffice. Notably, this implies that the random Clifford measurements algorithm of Huang, Kueng, and Preskill, which is sample-optimal for mixed states, is not optimal for pure states. Interestingly, our result also uses the same random Clifford measurements but employs a different estimator.</description>

      <title>Error estimation in current noisy quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main important features of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is the correct evaluation and consideration of errors. In this paper, we analyze the main sources of errors in current (IBM) quantum computers and we present a useful tool (TED-qc) designed to facilitate the total error probability expected for any quantum circuit. We propose this total error probability as the best way to estimate a lower bound for the fidelity in the NISQ era, avoiding the necessity of comparing the quantum calculations with any classical one. In order to contrast the robustness of our tool we compute the total error probability that may occur in three different quantum models: 1) the Ising model, 2) the Quantum-Phase Estimation (QPE), and 3) the Grover's algorithm. For each model, the main quantities of interest are computed and benchmarked against the reference simulator's results as a function of the error probability for a representative and statistically significant sample size. The analysis is satisfactory in more than the $99\%$ of the cases. In addition, we study how error mitigation techniques are able to eliminate the noise induced during the measurement. These results have been calculated for the IBM quantum computers, but both the tool and the analysis can be easily extended to any other quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in open quantum systems: Bridging the gap between quantum continuous measurements and full counting statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuously measured quantum systems are characterized by an output current, in the form of a stochastic and correlated time series which conveys crucial information about the underlying quantum system. The many tools used to describe current fluctuations are scattered across different communities: quantum opticians often use stochastic master equations, while a prevalent approach in condensed matter physics is provided by full counting statistics. These, however, are simply different sides of the same coin. Our goal with this tutorial is to provide a unified toolbox for describing current fluctuations. This not only provides novel insights, by bringing together different fields in physics, but also yields various analytical and numerical tools for computing quantities of interest. We illustrate our results with various pedagogical examples, and connect them with topical fields of research, such as waiting-time statistics, quantum metrology, thermodynamic uncertainty relations, quantum point contacts and Maxwell's demons.</description>

      <title>The Generations of Classical Correlations via Quantum Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose two separated parties, Alice and Bob, share a bipartite quantum state or a classical correlation called a \emph{seed}, and they try to generate a target classical correlation by performing local quantum or classical operations on the seed, i.e., any communications are not allowed. We consider the following fundamental problem about this setting: whether Alice and Bob can use a given seed to generate a target classical correlation. We show that this problem has rich mathematical structures. Firstly, we prove that even if the seed is a pure bipartite state, the above decision problem is already NP-hard and a similar conclusion can also be drawn when the seed is also a classical correlation, implying that this problem is hard to solve generally. Furthermore, we prove that when the seed is a pure quantum state, solving the problem is equivalent to finding out whether the target classical correlation has some diagonal form of positive semi-definite factorizations that matches the seed pure state, revealing an interesting connection between the current problem and optimization theory. Based on this observation and other insights, we give several necessary conditions where the seed pure state has to satisfy to generate the target classical correlation, and it turns out that these conditions can also be generalized to the case that the seed is a mixed quantum state. Lastly, since diagonal forms of positive semi-definite factorizations play a crucial role in solving the problem, we develop an algorithm that can compute them for an arbitrary classical correlation, which has decent performance on the cases we test.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning algorithm aimed at learning states obtained from computational basis states by Clifford circuits doped with a finite number $t$ of $T$-gates. The algorithm learns an exact tomographic description of $t$-doped stabilizer states in terms of Pauli observables. This is possible because such states are countable and form a discrete set. To tackle the problem, we introduce a novel algebraic framework for $t$-doped stabilizer states, which extends beyond $T$-gates and includes doping with any kind of local non-Clifford gate. The algorithm requires resources of complexity $\text{poly}(n,2^t)$ and exhibits an exponentially small probability of failure.</description>

      <title>Magic of quantum hypergraph states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic, or nonstabilizerness, characterizes the deviation of a quantum state from the set of stabilizer states and plays a fundamental role from quantum state complexity to universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, analytical or even numerical characterizations of magic are very challenging, especially in the multi-qubit system, even with a moderate qubit number. Here we systemically and analytically investigate the magic resource of archetypal multipartite quantum states -- quantum hypergraph states, which can be generated by multi-qubit Controlled-phase gates encoded by hypergraphs. We first give the magic formula in terms of the stabilizer R$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$nyi-$\alpha$ entropies for general quantum hypergraph states and prove the magic can not reach the maximal value, if the average degree of the corresponding hypergraph is constant. Then we investigate the statistical behaviors of random hypergraph states and prove the concentration result that typically random hypergraph states can reach the maximal magic. This also suggests an efficient way to generate maximal magic states with random diagonal circuits. Finally, we study some highly symmetric hypergraph states with permutation-symmetry, such as the one whose associated hypergraph is $3$-complete, i.e., any three vertices are connected by a hyperedge. Counterintuitively, such states can only possess constant or even exponentially small magic for $\alpha\geq 2$. Our study advances the understanding of multipartite quantum magic and could lead to applications in quantum computing and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passetti et al. [Physical Review Letters 131, 036502 (2023)] recently assessed the potential of neural quantum states (NQS) in learning ground-state wave functions with volume-law entanglement scaling. They focused on NQS using feedforward neural networks, specifically applied to the complex SYK Hamiltonian for fermions. Their numerical results hint at an exponential increase in the required variational parameters as the system size grows, apparently tied to the entanglement growth within the SYK ground state. This challenges the general utility of NQS for highly entangled wavefunctions, contrasting with established analytical and numerical findings. Based on our experiments, we show that suitably chosen NQS can learn ground states with volume-law entanglement both for spin and fermionic problems. We argue that the setup utilized in the aforementioned letter reveals the inefficiency of non-fermionic NQS to learn fermionic states, rather than a general connection between entanglement content and learnability hardness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional phase space of classical physics treats space and time differently, and this difference carries over to field theories and quantum mechanics (QM). In this paper, the phase space is enhanced through two main extensions. First, we promote the time choice of the Legendre transform to a dynamical variable. Second, we extend the Poisson brackets of matter fields to a spacetime symmetric form. The ensuing "spacetime phase space" is employed to obtain an explicitly covariant version of Hamilton equations for relativistic field theories. A canonical-like quantization of the formalism is then presented in which the fields satisfy spacetime commutation relations and the foliation is quantum. In this approach, the classical action is also promoted to an operator and retains explicit covariance through its non-separability in the matter-foliation partition. The problem of establishing a correspondence between the new noncausal framework (where fields at different times are independent) and conventional QM is solved through a generalization of spacelike correlators to spacetime. In this generalization, the Hamiltonian is replaced by the action, and conventional particles by off-shell particles. When the foliation is quantized, the previous map is recovered by conditioning on foliation eigenstates, in analogy with the Page and Wootters mechanism. We also provide an interpretation of the correspondence in which the causal structure of a given theory emerges from the quantum correlations between the system and an environment. This idea holds for general quantum systems and allows one to generalize the density matrix to an operator containing the information of correlators both in space and time.</description>

Abstract: Generating nonclassical states of mechanical systems is a challenge relevant for testing the foundations of quantum mechanics and developing quantum technologies. Significant effort has been made to search for such states in the stationary behaviour of cavity optomechanical systems. We focus instead on the transient dynamics. We find that in the strong coupling regime the presence of an optical drive causes an initial mechanical coherent state to evolve to a nonclassical state, with strongly negative Wigner function. An analytical treatment for weak drive reveals that these states are quantum superpositions of coherent states. Numerical simulation shows that the presence of Wigner negativity is robust against weak dissipation.</description>

      <title>Toward a classification of PT-symmetric quantum systems: From dissipative dynamics to topology and wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of many-body non-Hermitian parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems are attracting a lot of interest due to their relevance in research areas ranging from quantum optics and continuously monitored dynamics to Euclidean wormholes in quantum gravity and dissipative quantum chaos. While a symmetry classification of non-Hermitian systems leads to 38 universality classes, we show that, under certain conditions, PT-symmetric systems are grouped into 24 universality classes. We identify 14 of them in a coupled two-site Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and confirm the classification by spectral analysis using exact diagonalization techniques. Intriguingly, in 4 of these 14 universality classes, AIII$_\nu$, BDI$^\dagger_\nu$, BDI$_{++\nu}$, and CI$_{--\nu}$, we identify a basis in which the SYK Hamiltonian has a block structure in which some blocks are rectangular, with $\nu \in \mathbb{N}$ the difference between the number of rows and columns. We show analytically that this feature leads to the existence of $\nu$ robust purely \emph{real} eigenvalues, whose level statistics follow the predictions of Hermitian random matrix theory for classes A, AI, BDI, and CI, respectively. We have recently found that this $\nu$ is a topological invariant, so these classes are topological. By contrast, nontopological real eigenvalues display a crossover between Hermitian and non-Hermitian level statistics. Similarly to the case of Lindbladian dynamics, the reduction of universality classes leads to unexpected results, such as the absence of Kramers degeneracy in a given sector of the theory. Another novel feature of the classification scheme is that different sectors of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian may have different symmetries.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically-induced transparency assists the Raman gradient echo memory at moderate detuning, dependent on gradient order</title>

Abstract: Optical quantum memories are essential for quantum communications and photonic quantum technologies. Ensemble optical memories based on 3-level interactions are a popular basis for implementing these memories. All such memories, however, suffer from loss due to scattering. In off-resonant 3-level interactions, such as the Raman gradient echo memory (GEM), scattering loss can be reduced by a large detuning from the intermediate state. In this work, we show how electromagnetically induced transparency adjacent to the Raman absorption line plays a crucial role in reducing scattering loss, so that maximum efficiency is in fact achieved at a moderate detuning. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the transparency, and therefore the efficiency of GEM, depends on the order in which gradients are applied to store and recall the light. We provide a theoretical analysis and show experimentally how the efficiency depends on gradient order and detuning.</description>

      <title>Lifting noncontextuality inequalities</title>

Abstract: Kochen-Specker contextuality is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and a crucial resource for quantum computational advantage and reduction of communication complexity. Its presence is witnessed in empirical data by the violation of noncontextuality inequalities. However, all known noncontextuality inequalities corresponding to facets of noncontextual polytopes are either Bell inequalities or refer to cyclic or state-independent contextuality scenarios. We introduce a general method for lifting noncontextuality inequalities, deriving facets of noncontextual polytopes for more complex scenarios from known facets of simpler subscenarios. Concretely, starting from an arbitrary scenario, the addition of a new measurement or a new outcome preserves the facet-defining nature of any noncontextuality inequality. This extends the results of Pironio [J. Math. Phys. 46, 062112 (2005)] from Bell nonlocality scenarios to contextuality scenarios, unifying liftings of Bell and noncontextuality inequalities. Our method produces facet-defining noncontextuality inequalities in all scenarios with contextual correlations, and we present examples of facet-defining noncontextuality inequalities for scenarios where no examples were known. Our results shed light on the structure of noncontextuality polytopes and the relationship between such polytopes across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improving Zero-noise Extrapolation for Quantum-gate Error Mitigation using a Noise-aware Folding Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent thousand-qubit processors represent a significant hardware advancement, but current limitations prevent effective quantum error correction (QEC), necessitating reliance on quantum error mitigation (QEM) to enhance result fidelity from quantum computers. Our paper introduces a noise-aware folding technique that enhances Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) by leveraging the noise characteristics of target quantum hardware to fold circuits more efficiently. Unlike traditional ZNE approaches assuming uniform error distribution, our method redistributes noise using calibration data based on hardware noise models. By employing a noise-adaptive compilation method combined with our proposed folding mechanism, we enhance the ZNE accuracy of quantum gate-based computing using superconducting quantum computers. This paper highlights the uniqueness of our method, summarizes noise accumulation, presents the scaling algorithm, and compares the reliability of our method with those of existing models using linear extrapolation model. Experimental results show that compared to existing folding methods, our approach achieved a 35% improvement on quantum computer simulators and a 31% improvement on real quantum computers, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize a superconducting qubit processor to experimentally probe non-Markovian dynamics of an entangled qubit pair. We prepare an entangled state between two qubits and monitor the evolution of entanglement over time as one of the qubits interacts with a small quantum environment consisting of an auxiliary transmon qubit coupled to its readout cavity. We observe the collapse and revival of the entanglement as a signature of quantum memory effects in the environment. We then engineer the non-Markovianity of the environment by populating its readout cavity with thermal photons to show a transition from non-Markovian to Markovian dynamics, ultimately reaching a regime where the quantum Zeno effect creates a decoherence-free subspace that effectively stabilizes the entanglement between the qubits.</description>

Abstract: Classical data with graph structure always exists when dealing with many real-world problems. In parallel, quantum data with graph structure also need to be investigated since they are always produced by common quantum data sources.In this paper, we build a hybrid quantum-classical neural network with deep residual learning (Res-HQCNN) with graph-structured quantum data. Specifically, based on this special graph-structured quantum data, we first find suitable cost functions for Res-HQCNN model to learn semisupervised quantum data with graphs. Then, we present the training algorithm of Res-HQCNN for graph-structured training data in detail. Next, in order to show the learning ability of Res-HQCNN,we perform extensive experiments to show that the using of information about graph structures in quantum data can lead to better learning efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art model. At the same time, we also design comparable experiments to explain that the using of residual block structure can help deeper quantum neural networks learn graph-structured quantum data faster and better.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the notion of $k$-stabilizer universal quantum state, that is, an $n$-qubit quantum state, such that it is possible to induce any stabilizer state on any $k$ qubits, by using only local operations and classical communications. These states generalize the notion of $k$-pairable states introduced by Bravyi et al., and can be studied from a combinatorial perspective using graph states and $k$-vertex-minor universal graphs. First, we demonstrate the existence of $k$-stabilizer universal graph states that are optimal in size with $n=\Theta(k^2)$ qubits. We also provide parameters for which a random graph state on $\Theta(k^2)$ qubits is $k$-stabilizer universal with high probability. Our second contribution consists of two explicit constructions of $k$-stabilizer universal graph states on $n = O(k^4)$ qubits. Both rely upon the incidence graph of the projective plane over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. This provides a major improvement over the previously known explicit construction of $k$-pairable graph states with $n = O(2^{3k})$, bringing forth a new and potentially powerful family of multipartite quantum resources.</description>

Abstract: In quantum information theory, the accurate estimation of observables is pivotal for quantum information processing, playing a crucial role in compute and communication protocols. This work introduces a novel technique for estimating such objects, leveraging an underutilised resource in the inversion map of classical shadows that greatly refines the estimation cost of target observables without incurring any additional overhead. A generalised framework for computing and optimising additional degrees of freedom in the homogeneous space of the shadow inversion is given that may be adapted to a variety of near-term problems. In the special case of local measurement strategies we show feasible optimisation leading to an exponential separation in sample complexity versus the standard approach and in an exceptional case we give non-trivial examples of optimised post-processing for local measurements, achieving the same efficiency as the global Cliffords shadows.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for the collective non-Markovian decay of two fully excited quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics constitutes a modern paradigm for the interaction of light and matter, in which strong coupling, bath structure, and propagation delays can break the radiative conditions that quantum emitters typically encounter in free space. These characteristics intertwine the excitations of quantum emitters and guided radiation modes to form complex multiphoton dynamics. So far, combining the collective decay of the emitters with the non-Markovian effects induced by the modes has escaped a full solution and the detailed physics behind these systems remains unknown. Here we analyze such a collective non-Markovian decay in a minimal system of two excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional single-band waveguide. We develop an exact solution for this system in terms of elementary functions that unveils hidden symmetries and predicts new forms of spontaneous decay. The collective non-Markovian dynamics, which are strongly dependent on the vacuum coupling and the detuning from the center of the band, show exotic features that can be characterized with a simple and readily available criterion. Our analytic methods shed light on the complexity of collective light-matter interactions and open up a pathway for understanding multiparticle open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity is a prototypical example of a non-trivial open quantum system. Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unravelling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the inter detection times. Furthermore, by comparing single and multi-photon scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.</description>

Abstract: Strongly correlated electron systems are a cornerstone of modern physics, being responsible for groundbreaking phenomena from superconducting magnets to quantum computing. In most cases, correlations in electrons arise exclusively due to Coulomb interactions. In this work, we reveal that free electrons interacting simultaneously with a light field can become highly correlated via mechanisms beyond Coulomb interactions. In the case of two electrons, the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for the joint probability distribution of the output electron energies is enhanced over 13 orders of magnitude compared to that of electrons interacting with the light field in succession (one after another). These highly correlated electrons are the result of momentum and energy exchange between the participating electrons via the external quantum light field. Our findings pave the way to the creation and control of highly correlated free electrons for applications including quantum information and ultra-fast imaging.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the use of the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation to include complex variables for deriving quantum mechanical equations. However, these studies often assume that it is valid to apply the HJB equation directly to complex numbers, an approach that overlooks the fundamental problem of comparing complex numbers to find optimal controls. This paper explores how to correctly apply the HJB equation in the context of complex variables. Our findings significantly reevaluate the stochastic movement of quantum particles within the framework of stochastic optimal control theory. We derived the complex diffusion coefficient in the stochastic equation of motion using the Cauchy-Riemann theorem, considering that the particle's stochastic movement is described by two perfectly correlated real and imaginary stochastic processes. We demonstrated that the derived diffusion coefficient took a form that allowed the HJB equation to be linearized, thereby leading to the derivation of the Dirac equations. These insights deepen our understanding of quantum dynamics and enhance the mathematical rigor of the framework for applying stochastic optimal control to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Molecular Integrals of Solid Harmonic Gaussian Orbitals Using Quantum Entanglement of Angular Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating multi-center molecular integrals with Cartesian Gaussian-type basis sets has been a long-standing bottleneck in electronic structure theory calculation for solids and molecules. We have developed a vector-coupling and vector-uncoupling scheme to solve molecular Coulomb integrals with solid harmonics basis functions(SHGO). Solid harmonics are eigenstates of angular momentum, making it possible to factorize molecular integrals. By combining solid harmonic addition, differential and product rules, the computationally costly multi-center four-center integrals can be factored into an angular part and a radial component dependent on the atomic positions. The potential speed-up ratio in evaluating molecular nuclear Coulomb integrals in our method can reach up to four orders of magnitude for atomic orbitals with high angular momentum quantum numbers. The foundation underpinning the mathematical efficiency is the quantum angular momentum theory, where both vector-coupling and vector-uncoupling schemes correspond to unitary Clebsch-Gordan transformations that act on quantum angular momentum states, influencing their degree of entanglement. By incorporating quantum angular momentum through these transformations, the entanglement of the states can be reduced, and the less entanglement there is for a quantum system, the easier it is to simulate. The highly efficient method unveiled here opens new avenues for accelerated material and molecule design and discovery.</description>

      <title>Generation of multi-photon Fock states at telecommunication wavelength using picosecond pulsed light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-photon Fock states have diverse applications such as optical quantum information processing. For the implementation of quantum information processing, it is desirable that Fock states be generated within the telecommunication wavelength band, particularly in the C-band (1530-1565 nm). This is because mature optical communication technologies can be leveraged for the transmission, manipulation, and detection. Additionally, to achieve high-speed quantum information processing, it is desirable for Fock states to be generated in short optical pulses, as this allows embedding lots of information in the time domain. In this paper, we report the first generation of picosecond pulsed multi-photon Fock states (single-photon and two-photon states) in the C-band with Wigner negativities, which are verified by pulsed homodyne tomography. In our experimental setup, we utilize a single-pixel superconducting nanostrip photon-number-resolving detector (SNSPD), which is expected to facilitate the high-rate generation of various quantum states. This capability stems from the high temporal resolution of SNSPDs (50 ps in our case) allowing us to increase the repetition frequency of pulsed light from the conventional MHz range to the GHz range, although in this experiment the repetition frequency is limited to 10 MHz due to the bandwidth of the homodyne detector. Consequently, our experimental setup is anticipated to serve as a prototype of a high-speed optical quantum state generator for ultrafast quantum information processing at telecommunication wavelength.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the oracle separation between the physically motivated complexity class of noisy quantum circuits, inspired by definitions such as those presented by Chen, Cotler, Huang, and Li (2022). We establish that with a constant error rate, separation can be achieved in terms of NP. When the error rate is $\Omega(\log n/n)$, we can extend this result to the separation of PH. Notably, our oracles, in all separations, do not necessitate error correction schemes or fault tolerance, as all quantum circuits are of constant depth. This indicates that even quantum computers with minor errors, without error correction, may surpass classical complexity classes under various scenarios and assumptions. We also explore various common noise settings and present new classical hardness results, generalizing those found in studies by Raz and Tal (2022) and Bassirian, Bouland, Fefferman, Gunn, and Tal (2021), which are of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing is a promising candidate for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, analysis of CV quantum process relies mostly on direct computation of the evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture, and the features of CV space has yet to be thoroughly investigated in an intuitive manner. One key ingredient for further exploration of CV quantum computing is the construction of a computational model that brings visual intuition and new tools for analysis. In this paper, we delve into a graphical computational model, inspired by a similar model for qubit-based systems called the ZX calculus, that enables the representation of arbitrary CV quantum process as a simple directed graph. We demonstrate the utility of our model as a graphical tool to comprehend CV processes intuitively by showing how equivalences between two distinct quantum processes can be proven as a sequence of diagrammatic transformations in certain cases. We also examine possible applications of our model, such as measurement-based quantum computing, characterization of Gaussian and non-Gaussian processes, and circuit optimization.</description>

      <title>Disconnected entanglement entropy as a marker of edge modes in a periodically driven Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the disconnected entanglement entropy (DEE) of a Kitaev chain in which the chemical potential is periodically modulated with $\delta$-function pulses within the framework of Floquet theory. For this driving protocol, the DEE of a sufficiently large system with open boundary conditions turns out to be integer-quantized, with the integer being equal to the number of Majorana edge modes localized at each edge of the chain generated by the periodic driving, thereby establishing the DEE as a marker for detecting Floquet Majorana edge modes. Analysing the DEE, we further show that these Majorana edge modes are robust against weak spatial disorder and temporal noise. Interestingly, we find that the DEE may, in some cases, also detect the anomalous edge modes which can be generated by periodic driving of the nearest-neighbor hopping, even though such modes have no topological significance and not robust against spatial disorder. We also probe the behaviour of the DEE for a kicked Ising chain in the presence of an integrability breaking interaction which has been experimentally realized.</description>

      <title>Testing whether gravity acts as a quantum entity when measured</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A defining signature of classical systems is "in principle measurability" without disturbance: a feature manifestly violated by quantum systems. We describe a multi-interferometer experimental setup that can, in principle, reveal the nonclassicality of a spatial superposition-sourced gravitational field if an irreducible disturbance is caused by a measurement of gravity. While one interferometer sources the field, the others are used to measure the gravitational field created by the superposition. This requires neither any specific form of nonclassical gravity, nor the generation of entanglement between any relevant degrees of freedom at any stage, thus distinguishing it from the experiments proposed so far. This test, when added to the recent entanglement-witness based proposals, enlarges the domain of quantum postulates being tested for gravity. Moreover, the proposed test yields a signature of quantum measurement induced disturbance for any finite rate of decoherence, and is device independent.</description>

      <title>Sum rule for the pseudo-R\'enyi entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the density matrix to a transition matrix between two states, represented as $|\phi\rangle$ and $|\psi\rangle$, one can define the pseudoentropy analogous to the entanglement entropy. In this paper, we establish an operator sum rule that pertains to the reduced transition matrix and reduced density matrices corresponding to the superposition states of $|\phi\rangle$ and $|\psi\rangle$. It is demonstrated that the off-diagonal elements of operators can be correlated with the expectation value in the superposition state. Furthermore, we illustrate the connection between the pseudo-R\'enyi entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of the superposition states. We provide proof of the operator sum rule and verify its validity in both finite-dimensional systems and quantum field theory. We additionally demonstrate the significance of these sum rules in gaining insights into the physical implications of transition matrices, pseudoentropy, and their gravity dual.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00405v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian to address the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture. The eigenfunctions of the introduced Hamiltonian, subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the positive half-line, vanish at the origin by the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Consequently, the eigenvalues are determined by these nontrivial Riemann zeros. If the Riemann hypothesis (RH) is true, the eigenvalues become real and represent the imaginary parts of the nontrivial zeros. Conversely, if the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint, or more generally, admits only real eigenvalues, then the RH follows. In our attempt to demonstrate the latter, we establish the existence of a similarity transformation of the introduced Hamiltonian that is self-adjoint on the domain specified by an appropriate boundary condition, which is satisfied by the eigenfunctions through the vanishing of the Riemann zeta function. Our result can be extended to a broader class of functions whose zeros lie on the critical line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact quantum observable analog of the weak equivalence principle for a `relativistic' quantum particle. The quantum geodesic equations are obtained from Heisenberg equations of motion as an exact analog of a fully covariant classical Hamiltonian evolution picture, with the proper identification of the canonical momentum variables as $p_\mu$, rather than $p^\mu$. We discuss the meaning of the equations in relation to projective measurements as well as equations with solution curves as ones in the noncommutative geometric picture of spacetime, and a plausible approach to quantum gravity as a theory about quantum observables as physical quantities including the notion of quantum coordinate transformation.</description>

      <title>New Partial Trace Inequalities and Distillability of Werner States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in quantum information theory is to study whether any undistillable state has a positive partial transpose (PPT). This problem has been open for almost 30 years, and still no one has been able to give a complete answer to it. This work presents a new strategy to try to solve this problem by translating the distillability condition on the family of Werner states into a problem of partial trace inequalities. We present our two main results and a new bound for the 2-distillability, $\alpha \geq -\frac{1}{4}$. Moreover, we present throughout this work numerous partial trace inequalities, which are valid for many families of matrices.</description>

      <title>Flat band based delocalized-to-localized transitions in a non-Hermitian diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of quasiperiodic perturbations on one-dimensional non-Hermitian diamond lattices with an artificial magnetic flux $\theta$ that possess flat bands. Our study shows that the symmetry of these perturbations and the magnetic flux $\theta$ play a pivotal role in shaping the localization properties of the system. When $\theta=0$, the non-Hermitian lattice exhibits a single flat band in the crystalline case, and symmetric as well as antisymmetric perturbations can induce accurate mobility edges. In contrast, when $\theta=\pi$, the clean diamond lattice manifests three dispersionless bands referred to as an "all-band-flat" (ABF) structure, irrespective of the non-Hermitian parameter. The ABF structure restricts the transition from delocalized to localized states, as all states remain localized for any finite symmetric perturbation. Our numerical calculations further unveil that the ABF system subjected to antisymmetric perturbations exhibits multifractal-to-localized edges. Multifractal states are predominantly concentrated in the internal region of the spectrum. Additionally, we explore the case where $\theta$ lies within the range of $(0, \pi)$, revealing a diverse array of complex localization features.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing an ultracold Fermi gas against Fermi acceleration to superdiffusion through localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization, i.e., destructive quantum interference of multiple-scattering paths, halts transport entirely. Contrarily, time-dependent random forces expedite transport via Fermi acceleration, proposed as a mechanism for high-energy cosmic rays. Their competition creates interesting dynamics, but experimental observations are scarce. Here, we experimentally study the expansion of an ultracold Fermi gas inside time-dependent disorder and observe distinct regimes from sub- to superdiffusion. Unexpectedly, quantum interference counteracts acceleration in strong disorder. Our system enables the investigation of Fermi acceleration in the quantum-transport regime.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian of a nonrelativistic Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for a spherical domain in the ground state of a nonrelativistic free-fermion gas in arbitrary dimensions. Decomposed into a set of radial entanglement Hamiltonians, we show that the entanglement spectrum in each sector is identical to that of a hopping chain in a linear potential, with the angular momentum playing the role of the subsystem boundary. Furthermore, the eigenfunctions follow from a commuting differential operator that has exactly the form predicted by conformal field theory. Rescaled by the radial Fermi velocity, this operator gives a perfect approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian, except for large angular momenta that belong to the edge regime in the analogous gradient chain. One thus finds that the conformal field theory result becomes asymptotically exact only in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and dynamics of coupled complex SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known that the large-$q$ complex SYK model falls under the same universality class as that of van der Waals (mean-field) and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, both features shared by various black holes. This makes the SYK model a useful tool in probing the fundamental nature of quantum chaos and holographic duality. This work establishes the robustness of this shared universality class and chaotic properties for SYK-like models by extending to a system of coupled large-$q$ complex SYK models of different orders. We provide a detailed derivation of thermodynamic properties, specifically the critical exponents for an observed phase transition, as well as dynamical properties, in particular the Lyapunov exponent, via the out-of-time correlator calculations. Our analysis reveals that, despite the introduction of an additional scaling parameter through interaction strength ratios, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at low temperatures, similar to that of the single SYK model. The critical exponents align with the Landau-Ginzburg (mean-field) universality class, shared with van der Waals gases and various AdS black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coupled SYK system remains maximally chaotic in the large-$q$ limit at low temperatures, adhering to the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, a feature consistent with the single SYK model. These findings establish robustness and open avenues for broader inquiries into the universality and chaos in complex quantum systems. We provide a detailed outlook for future work by considering the ``very" low-temperature regime, where we discuss relations with the Hawking-Page phase transition observed in the holographic dual black holes. We present preliminary calculations and discuss the possible follow-ups that might be be taken to make the connection robust.</description>

      <title>Topological Solitons in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with periodic hopping modulation, domain walls and disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A chiral symmetric Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain features topological end states in one of its dimerized configurations. Those mid-gap zero energy states show interesting modifications upon a periodic tuning of the hopping modulations. Besides, more and more in-gap end modes appear at nonzero energies for further partitioning of the Brillouin zone (BZ) due to increased hopping periodicity. The new topological phases are identified with a detailed analysis of the topological invariants namely, winding number and Zak phases. The spectra and topology of these systems with periodically modulated hopping are studied also in the presence of a single static domain wall, separating two topologically inequivalent dimerized structures. The domain wall causes additional in-gap modes in the spectrum as well as zero energy domain wall solitonic states for specific hopping periodicities. We also study the effect of disorder, particularly the chirality breaking onsite ones, on the edge and domain wall states. Other than the SSH type we also consider random, Rice-Mele or AI type disorder to do a comparative analysis of the evolution of chirality and zero energy states as the strength of disorder and hopping periodicity is varied. Our findings can add important feedback in utilizing topological phases in various fields including quantum computations while the results can be easily verified in a cold atom set up within optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf symmetry and tube algebra of the generalized multifusion string-net model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multifusion generalization of string-net ground states and lattice Hamiltonians, delving into its associated weak Hopf symmetry. For the multifusion string-net, the gauge symmetry manifests as a general weak Hopf algebra, leading to a reducible vacuum string label; the charge symmetry, serving as a quantum double of gauge symmetry, constitutes a connected weak Hopf algebra. This implies that the associated topological phase retains its characterization by a unitary modular tensor category (UMTC). The bulk charge symmetry can also be captured by a weak Hopf tube algebra. We offer an explicit construction of the weak Hopf tube algebra structure and thoroughly discuss its properties. The gapped boundary and domain wall models are extensively discussed, with these $1d$ phases characterized by unitary multifusion categories (UMFCs). We delve into the gauge and charge symmetries of these $1d$ phases, as well as the construction of the boundary and domain wall tube algebras. Additionally, we illustrate that the domain wall tube algebra can be regarded as a cross product of two boundary tube algebras. As an application of our model, we elucidate how to interpret the defective string-net as a restricted multifusion string-net.</description>

      <title>Accurate and precise quantum computation of valence two-neutron systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing methods to solve nuclear many-body problems with quantum computers is an imperative pursuit within the nuclear physics community. Here, we introduce a quantum algorithm to accurately and precisely compute the ground state of valence two-neutron systems leveraging presently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. Our focus lies on the nuclei having a doubly-magic core plus two valence neutrons in the $ p $, $ sd $, and $ pf $ shells, i.e. ${}^6$He, ${}^{18}$O, and ${}^{42}$Ca, respectively. Our ansatz, quantum circuit, is constructed in the pair-wise form, taking into account the symmetries of the system in an explicit manner, and enables us to reduce the number of qubits and the number of CNOT gates required. The results on a real quantum hardware by IBM Quantum Platform show that the proposed method gives very accurate results of the ground-state energies, which are typically within $ 0.1 \, \% $ error in the energy for ${}^6$He and ${}^{18}$O and at most $ 1 \, \% $ error for ${}^{42}$Ca. Furthermore, our experiments using real quantum devices also show the pivotal role of the circuit layout design, attuned to the connectivity of the qubits, in mitigating errors.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Superconducting Magnetoelectric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18616v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we argue that a nonlinear superconducting magnetoelectric effect (NSM) can naturally manifest in altermagnet/superconductor (ALM/SC) heterostructures: NSM manifests as a spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM is the leading order magnetization response in ALM/SC heterostructures and survives even in the presence of centrosymmetry; $C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry in altermagnets zeroes both the equilibrium magnetization as well as out-of-plane linear magnetoelectric response. This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in ALM/SC heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>
