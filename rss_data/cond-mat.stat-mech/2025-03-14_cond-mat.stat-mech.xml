      <title>Large symmetry and hierarchical ordering transitions in sliding ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals "sliding" ferroelectric bilayers, whose electric polarization is locked to the interlayer alignment, show promise for future non-volatile memory and other nanoelectronic devices. These applications require a fuller understanding of the polarization stability and switching properties, which present models have described in terms of an Ising-like binary polarization. However, it is a much larger translation symmetry that is broken in the polar state. Here we introduce a discrete statistical-mechanical model that emphasizes the effect of this larger symmetry. Through Monte-Carlo numerics we show this model possesses a richer phase diagram, including an intermediate critical phase of algebraically-correlated polarization. A low energy effective theory allows us to connect the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless class, driven by excitations not available in Ising-like models. Our results indicate the need for theoretical models of this ferroelectric system to account for the larger symmetry.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Bound on Energy and Negentropy Costs of Inference in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental thermodynamic bound is derived for the energy cost of inference in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By applying Landauer's principle, we demonstrate that the linear operations in DNNs can, in principle, be performed reversibly, whereas the non-linear activation functions impose an unavoidable energy cost. The resulting theoretical lower bound on the inference energy is determined by the average number of neurons undergoing state transition for each inference. We also restate the thermodynamic bound in terms of negentropy, a metric which is more universal than energy for assessing thermodynamic cost of information processing. Concept of negentropy is further elaborated in the context of information processing in biological and engineered system as well as human intelligence. Our analysis provides insight into the physical limits of DNN efficiency and suggests potential directions for developing energy-efficient AI architectures that leverage reversible analog computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider TASEP with a single second class particle and periodic boundary conditions. Using Bethe ansatz, we compute stationary large deviations for the joint statistics of the current of first and second class particles. At large scales, the generating function of the joint cumulants shows an unexpected connection to current fluctuations of TASEP with open boundaries.</description>

      <title>Phase locking and fractional Shapiro steps in collective dynamics of microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In driven nonlinear systems, phase locking is an intriguing effect leading to robust stationary states that are stable over extended ranges of control parameters. Recent experiments allow for exploring microscopic mechanisms underlying such phenomena in collective dynamics of micro- and nanoparticles. Here we show that phase-locked dynamics of hardcore-interacting microparticles in a densely populated periodic potential under time-periodic driving arises from running solitary cluster waves. We explain how values of phase-locked currents are related to soliton velocities and why collective particle dynamics synchronize with the driving for certain particle diameters only. Our analysis is based on an effective potential for the solitary wave propagation and a unit displacement law, saying that the total average shift of all particle positions per soliton period equals one wavelength of the periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Velocity trapping in the lifted TASEP and the true self-avoiding random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss non-reversible Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms that, for particle systems, rigorously sample the positional Boltzmann distribution and that have faster than physical dynamics. These algorithms all feature a non-thermal velocity distribution. They are exemplified by the lifted TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process), a one-dimensional lattice reduction of event-chain Monte Carlo. We analyze its dynamics in terms of a velocity trapping that arises from correlations between the local density and the particle velocities. This allows us to formulate a conjecture for its out-of-equilibrium mixing time scale, and to rationalize its equilibrium superdiffusive time scale. Both scales are faster than for the (unlifted) TASEP. They are further justified by our analysis of the lifted TASEP in terms of many-particle realizations of true self-avoiding random walks. We discuss velocity trapping beyond the case of one-dimensional lattice models and in more than one physical dimensions. Possible applications beyond physics are pointed out.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic correlation inequalities for finite times and transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a thermodynamic bound on correlation times was formulated in [A. Dechant, J. Garnier-Brun, S.-i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 167101 (2023)], showing how the decay of correlations in Langevin dynamics is bounded by short-time fluctuations and dissipation. Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.</description>

      <title>The benefit of ignorance for traffic through a random congestible network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When traffic is routed through a network that is susceptible to congestion, the self-interested decisions made by individual users do not, in general, produce the optimal flow. This discrepancy is quantified by the so-called "price of anarchy." Here we consider whether the traffic produced by self-interested users is made better or worse when users have uncertain knowledge about the cost functions of the links in the network, and we define a parallel concept that we call the "price of ignorance." We introduce a simple model in which fast, congestible links and slow, incongestible links are mixed randomly in a large network and users plan their routes with finite uncertainty about which of the two cost functions describes each link. One of our key findings is that a small level of user ignorance universally improves traffic, regardless of the network composition. Further, there is an optimal level of ignorance which, in our model, causes the self-interested user behavior to coincide with the optimum. Many features of our model can be understood analytically, including the optimal level of user ignorance and the existence of critical scaling near the percolation threshold for fast links, where the potential benefit of user ignorance is greatest.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>

      <title>Two-by-two ordinal patterns in art paintings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of visual arts has recently expanded to encompass a more extensive array of artworks due to the availability of large-scale digitized art collections. Consistent with formal analyses by art historians, many of these studies highlight the significance of encoding spatial structures within artworks to enhance our understanding of visual arts. However, defining universally applicable, interpretable, and sufficiently simple units that capture the essence of paintings and their artistic styles remains challenging. Here we examine ordering patterns in pixel intensities within two-by-two partitions of images from nearly 140,000 paintings created over the past thousand years. These patterns, categorized into eleven types based on arguments of continuity and symmetry, are both universally applicable and detailed enough to correlate with low-level visual features of paintings. We uncover a universal distribution of these patterns, with consistent prevalence within groups, yet modulated across groups by a nontrivial interplay between pattern smoothness and the likelihood of identical pixel intensities. This finding provides a standardized metric for comparing paintings and styles, further establishing a scale to measure deviations from the average prevalence. Our research also shows that these simple patterns carry valuable information for identifying painting styles, though styles generally exhibit considerable variability in the prevalence of ordinal patterns. Moreover, shifts in the prevalence of these patterns reveal a trend in which artworks increasingly diverge from the average incidence over time; however, this evolution is neither smooth nor uniform, with substantial variability in pattern prevalence, particularly after the 1930s.</description>

      <title>Dielectrocapillarity for exquisite control of fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially varying electric fields are prevalent throughout nature and technology, arising from heterogeneity inherent to all physical systems. Inhomogeneous electric fields can originate naturally, such as in nanoporous materials and biological membranes, or be engineered, e.g., with patterned electrodes or layered van der Waals heterostructures. While uniform fields cause free ions to migrate, for polar fluids they simply act to reorient the constituent molecules. In contrast, electric field gradients (EFGs) induce a dielectrophoretic force, offering exquisite electrokinetic control of a fluid, even in the absence of free charge carriers. EFGs, therefore, offer vast potential for optimizing fluid behavior under confinement, such as in nanoporous electrodes, nanofluidic devices, and chemical separation materials. Yet, EFGs remain largely unexplored at the microscopic level owing to the absence of a rigorous, first principles theoretical treatment of electrostrictive effects. By integrating state-of-the-art advances in liquid state theory and deep learning, we reveal how EFGs modulate fluid structure and capillary phenomena. We demonstrate, from first principles, that dielectrophoretic coupling enables tunable control over the liquid-gas phase transition, capillary condensation, and fluid uptake into porous media. Our findings establish "dielectrocapillarity'' -- the use of EFGs to control confined fluids -- as a powerful tool for controlling volumetric capacity in nanopores, which holds immense potential for optimizing energy storage in supercapacitors, selective gas separation, and tunable hysteresis in neuromorphic nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <title>A New Circle Theorem for Two Dimensional Ising Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Yang circle theorem revolutionized our understanding of phase transitions in ferromagnetic systems by showing that the complex zeros of partition functions lie on the unit circle, with criticality arising as these zeros approach the real axis in the thermodynamic limit. However, in frustrated systems such as antiferromagnets and spin glasses, the zeros deviate from this structure, making it challenging to extend the Lee-Yang theory to disordered systems. In this work, we establish a new circle theorem for two-dimensional Ising spin glasses, proving that the square of the partition function exhibits zeros densely packed along the unit circle. Numerical simulations on the square lattice confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the circle law for quenched disorder. Furthermore, our results uncover a finite-temperature crossover in $\pm J$ spin glasses, characterized by the emergence of a spectral gap in the angular distribution of zeros. This result extends the Lee-Yang framework to disordered systems, offering new insights into spin-glass criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find nonequilibrium phase transitions accompanied by multiple (nested) hysteresis behaviors in superconductors coupled to baths under a time-periodic light driving.The transitions are demonstrated with a full phase diagram in the domain of the driving amplitude and frequency by means of the Floquet many-body theory. In the weak driving regime with a frequency smaller than half of the superconducting gap, excited quasiparticles are accumulated at the far edges of the bands, realizing a distribution reminiscent of the Eliashberg effect, which suddenly becomes unstable in the strong driving regime due to multi-photon-assisted tunneling across the gap mediated by the in-gap Floquet sidebands. We also show that superconductivity is enhanced in the weak driving regime without effective cooling, which is attributed to the modulation of the spectrum due to Floquet sidebands.</description>

      <title>A novel metric for species vulnerability and coexistence in spatially-extended ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to understand the persistence and coexistence of competitive species in a spatially explicit metacommunity model with a heterogeneous dispersal kernel. Our analysis, based on methods from the physics of disordered systems and non-Gaussian dynamical mean field theory, reveals that species coexistence is governed by a single key parameter, which we term competitive balance. From competitive balance, we derive a novel metric to quantitatively assess the vulnerability of a species, showing that abundance alone is not sufficient to determine it. Rather, a species' vulnerability crucially depends on the state of the metacommunity as a whole. We test our theory by analyzing two distinct tropical forest datasets, finding excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. A key step in our analysis is the introduction of a new quantity - the competitive score - which disentangles the abundance distribution and enables us to circumvent the challenge of estimating both the colonization kernel and the joint abundance distribution. Our findings provide novel and fundamental insights into the ecosystem-level trade-offs underlying macroecological patterns and introduce a robust approach for estimating extinction risks.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state learnability transitions in monitored noisy quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider learnability transitions in monitored quantum systems that undergo noisy evolution, subject to a global strong symmetry -- i.e., in addition to the measuring apparatus, the system can interact with an unobserved environment, but does not exchange charge with it. As in the pure-state setting, we find two information-theoretic phases -- a sharp (fuzzy) phase in which an eavesdropper can rapidly (slowly) learn the symmetry charge. However, because the dynamics is noisy, both phases can be simulated efficiently using tensor networks. Indeed, even when the true dynamics is unitary, introducing noise by hand allows an eavesdropper to efficiently learn the symmetry charge from local measurements, as we demonstrate. We identify the fuzzy phase in this setting as a mixed-state phase that exhibits spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and average symmetry protected topological order in the doubled Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition takes place between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that the unitary operation on the system's subspace uniquely determines the corresponding unitary operator on the environment's subspace. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we identify the requirements that local operations must satisfy to ensure that the eternal black hole states remain static in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Integrable fishnet circuits and Brownian solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Neural Density Functional Theory in Higher Dimensions with Convolutional Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on recent advancements in using machine learning for classical density functional theory for systems with one-dimensional, planar inhomogeneities, we propose a machine learning model for application in two dimensions (2D) akin to density functionals in weighted density forms, as e. g. in fundamental measure theory (FMT). We implement the model with fast convolutional layers only and apply it to a system of hard disks in fully 2D inhomogeneous situations. The model is trained on a combination of smooth and steplike external potentials in the fluid phase. Pair correlation functions from test particle geometry show very satisfactory agreement with simulations although these types of external potentials have not been included in the training. The method should be fully applicable to 3D problems, where the bottleneck at the moment appears to be in obtaining smooth enough 3D histograms as training data from simulations.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.</description>

      <title>Canonical equilibrium of mean-field $O(n)$~models in presence of random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study canonical-equilibrium properties of Random Field $O(n)$ Models involving classical continuous vector spins of $n$ components with mean-field interactions and subject to disordered fields acting on individual spins. To this end, we employ two complementary approaches: the mean-field approximation, valid for any disorder distribution, and the replica trick, applicable when the disordered fields are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. On the basis of an exact analysis, we demonstrate that when replica symmetry holds, both the approaches yield identical expression for the free energy per spin of the system. As consequences, we study the case of $n=2$ ($XY$ spins) and that of $n=3$ (Heisenberg spins) for two representative choices of the disorder distribution, namely, a Gaussian and a symmetric bimodal distribution. For both $n=2$ and $n=3$, we demonstrate that while the magnetization exhibits a continuous phase transition as a function of temperature for the Gaussian case, the transition could be either continuous or first-order with an emergent tricriticality when the disorder distribution is bimodal. We also discuss in the context of our models the issue of self-averaging of extensive variables near the critical point of a continuous phase transition.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviors and dynamics of active particle systems in double-well potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behaviors and dynamics of self-propelled particles with active reorientation (AR) in a double-well potential. We explore the competition between AR and external potentials, revealing that self-propelled particles exhibit flocking and clustering behaviors in an asymmetric potential trap. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain a phase diagram that illustrates flocking behavior as a function of active reorientation and potential asymmetry. We compare the responses of inactive and active particles to the potential, finding that active reorientation significantly increases aggregation on one side of the asymmetric potential well. Additionally, by calculating the mean squared displacement and scaling exponent, we identify distinct diffusion regimes. Our findings demonstrate that active particles with active reorientation are more sensitive to variations in double-well potentials.</description>

Abstract: Nucleation and growth is studied in a system undergoing diffusion-controlled condensation under gradual changes in parameters, such as cooling. It is demonstrated that when Gibbs-Thompson effect becomes negligible, the system falls into a universal regime. i.e. the final droplet size distribution remains invariant under certain rescaling of system parameters. An approximate yet very accurate analytic form is obtained for the size distribution function in this regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model of crack patterns in thin colloidal films undergoing desiccation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number of geometric and topological properties of samples of crack-template based conductive films are examined to assess the degree to which Voronoi diagrams can successfully model structure and conductivity in such networks. Our analysis suggests that although Poisson--Voronoi diagrams are only partially successful in modeling structural features of real-world crack patterns formed in films undergoing desiccation, such diagrams can nevertheless be useful in situations where topological characteristics are more important than geometric ones. A phenomenological model is proposed that is more accurate at capturing features of the real-world crack patterns.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable model of the square-root price impact dynamics under the long-range market-order correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In econophysics, there are several enigmatic empirical laws: (i)~the market-order flow has strong persistence (long-range order-sign correlation), well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. This phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii)~the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. In this Letter, we propose an exactly solvable model of the nonlinear price-impact dynamics that unifies these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable L\'evy-walk model. Our exact solution and numerical simulations reveal three important points: First, the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under the long-range correlation. Second, price-movement statistics follows truncated power laws with typical exponent around three. Third, volatility has long memory. While this simple model lacks adjustable free parameters, it naturally aligns even with other enigmatic empirical laws, such as (iii)~the inverse-cubic law for price statistics and (iv)~volatility clustering. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in understanding rich and complex financial price dynamics from a single coherent viewpoint.</description>
