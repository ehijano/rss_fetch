      <title>Galileo's Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of physics didactics, alternative instructional approaches have often been employed to facilitate conceptual understanding of various topics. In this article, an alternative formulation for analyzing the motion of bodies on inclined planes is presented, based on Galileo's experimental rule involving multiples of odd numbers. According to this, bodies traverse distances that increase in odd multiples of an initial amount during successive equal time intervals. In the proposed formulation, a function is established between distance, whether ascending or descending, and time, omitting the use of Newtonian concepts such as velocity, acceleration, or force. The theoretical exploration of this formulation may provide significant didactical benefits, offering scenarios for discussion and reflection in physics didactics.</description>

      <title>Physics Playground: Insights from a Qualitative-Quantitative Study about VR-Based Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics Playground is an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) application designed for educational purposes, featuring a virtual laboratory where users interact with various physics phenomena through guided experiments. This study aims to evaluate the application's design and educational content to facilitate its integration into classroom settings. A quantitative data collection investigated learning outcomes, related confidence, user experience, and perceived cognitive load, through a 2x2 within-between subjects setup, with participants divided into two conditions (VR vs. slideshow) and knowledge levels assessed twice (pre- and post-tests). A qualitative approach included interviews and a focus group to explore education experts' opinions on the overall experience and didactic content. Results showed an improvement in physics knowledge and confidence after the learning experience compared to baseline, regardless of the condition. Despite comparable perceived cognitive load, slideshow learning was slightly more effective in enhancing physics knowledge. However, both qualitative and quantitative results highlighted the immersive advantage of VR in enhancing user satisfaction. This approach pointed out limitations and advantages of VR-based learning, but more research is needed to understand how it can be implemented into broader teaching strategies.</description>

      <title>Extending the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies: new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing industrial relevance of quantum technologies (QTs), a new quantum workforce with special qualification will be needed. Building this workforce requires educational efforts, ranging from short term training to degree programs. In order to plan, map and compare such efforts, personal qualifications or job requirements, standardization is necessary. The European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) provides a common language for QT education. The 2024 update to version~2.5 extends it by the new proficiency triangle and qualification profiles: The proficiency triangle proposes six proficiency levels for three proficiency areas, specifying knowledge and skills for each level. Nine qualification profiles show prototypical qualifications or job roles relevant to the quantum industry, with the required proficiency, examples, and suggestions. This is an important step towards the standardization of QT education. The CFQT update is based on the results of an analysis of 34 interviews on industry needs. The initial findings from the interviews were complemented by iterative refinement and expert consultation.</description>
