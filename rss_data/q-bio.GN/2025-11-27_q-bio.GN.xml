      <title>SeqManager: A Web-Based Tool for Efficient Sequencing Data Storage Management and Duplicate Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Modern genomics laboratories generate massive volumes of sequencing data, often resulting in significant storage costs. Genomics storage consists of duplicate files, temporary processing files, and redundant intermediate data. Results: We developed SeqManager, a web-based application that provides automated identification, classification, and management of sequencing data files with intelligent duplicate detection. It also detects intermediate sequencing files that can safely be removed. Evaluation across four genomics laboratory settings demonstrate that our tool is fast and has a very low memory footprint.</description>

      <title>Moonshine.jl: a Julia package for genome-scale model-based ancestral recombination graph inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is the model of choice in statistical genetics to model population ancestries. Software capable of simulating ARGs on a genome scale within a reasonable amount of time are now widely available for most practical use cases. While the inverse problem of inferring ancestries from a sample of haplotypes has seen major progress in the last decade, it does not enjoy the same level of advancement as its counterpart. Up until recently, even moderately sized samples could only be handled using heuristics. In recent years, the possibility of model-based inference for datasets closer to "real world" scenarios has become a reality, largely due to the development of threading-based samplers. This article introduces Moonshine.jl, a Julia package that has the ability, among other things, to infer ARGs for samples of thousands of human haplotypes of sizes on the order of hundreds of megabases within a reasonable amount of time. On recent hardware, our package is able to infer an ARG for samples of densely haplotyped (over one marker/kilobase) human chromosomes of sizes up to 10000 in well under a day on data simulated by msprime. Scaling up simulation on a compute cluster is straightforward thanks to a strictly single-threaded implementation. While model-based, it does not resort to threading but rather places restrictions on probability distributions typically used in simulation software in order to enforce sample consistency. In addition to being efficient, a strong emphasis is placed on ease of use and integration into the biostatistical software ecosystem.</description>

      <title>MoRE: Batch-Robust Multi-Omics Representations from Frozen Pre-trained Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representation learning on multi-omics data is challenging due to extreme dimensionality, modality heterogeneity, and cohort-specific batch effects. While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with Scrublet, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models.</description>
