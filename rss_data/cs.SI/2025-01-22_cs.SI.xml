      <title>MurkySky: Analyzing News Reliability on Bluesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluesky has recently emerged as a lively competitor to Twitter/X for a platform for public discourse and news sharing. Most of the research on Bluesky so far has focused on characterizing its adoption due to migration. There has been less interest on characterizing the properties of Bluesky as a platform for news sharing and discussion, and in particular the prevalence of unreliable information on it. To fill this gap, this research provides the first comprehensive analysis of news reliability on Bluesky. We introduce MurkySky, a public tool to track the prevalence of content from unreliable news sources on Bluesky. Using firehose data from the summer of 2024, we find that on Bluesky reliable-source news content is prevalent, and largely originating from left-leaning sources. Content from unreliable news sources, while accounting for a small fraction of all news-linking posts, tends to originate from more partisan sources, but largely reflects the left-leaning skew of the platform. Analysis of the language and hashtags used in news-linking posts shows that unreliable-source content concentrates on specific topics of discussion.</description>

      <title>Influence- and Interest-based Worker Recruitment in Crowdsourcing using Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Workers recruitment remains a significant issue in Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS), where the aim is to recruit a group of workers that maximizes the expected Quality of Service (QoS). Current recruitment systems assume that a pre-defined pool of workers is available. However, this assumption is not always true, especially in cold-start situations, where a new MCS task has just been released. Additionally, studies show that up to 96\% of the available candidates are usually not willing to perform the assigned tasks. To tackle these issues, recent works use Online Social Networks (OSNs) and Influence Maximization (IM) to advertise about the desired MCS tasks through influencers, aiming to build larger pools. However, these works suffer from several limitations, such as 1) the lack of group-based selection methods when choosing influencers, 2) the lack of a well-defined worker recruitment process following IM, 3) and the non-dynamicity of the recruitment process, where the workers who refuse to perform the task are not substituted. In this paper, an Influence- and Interest-based Worker Recruitment System (IIWRS), using OSNs, is proposed. The proposed system has two main components: 1) an MCS-, group-, and interest-based IM approach, using a Genetic Algorithm, to select a set of influencers from the network to advertise about the MCS tasks, and 2) a dynamic worker recruitment process which considers the social attributes of workers, and is able to substitute those who do not accept to perform the assigned tasks. Empirical studies are performed using real-life datasets, while comparing IIWRS with existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Eigenvector Centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks significantly influence social, economic, and organizational outcomes, with centrality measures serving as crucial tools to capture the importance of individual nodes. This paper introduces Laplacian Eigenvector Centrality (LEC), a novel framework for network analysis based on spectral graph theory and the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix. A distinctive feature of LEC is its adjustable parameter, the LEC order, which enables researchers to control and assess the scope of centrality measurement using the Laplacian spectrum. Using random graph models, LEC demonstrates robustness and scalability across diverse network structures. We connect LEC to equilibrium responses to external shocks in an economic model, showing how LEC quantifies agents' roles in attenuating shocks and facilitating coordinated responses through quadratic optimization. Finally, we apply LEC to the study of microfinance diffusion, illustrating how it complements classical centrality measures, such as eigenvector and Katz-Bonacich centralities, by capturing distinctive aspects of node positions within the network.</description>

      <title>B-Call: Integrating Ideological Position and Political Cohesion in Legislative Voting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper combines two significant areas of political science research: measuring individual ideological position and cohesion. Although both approaches help analyze legislative behaviors, no unified model currently integrates these dimensions. To fill this gap, the paper proposes a methodology called B-Call that combines ideological positioning with voting cohesion, treating votes as random variables. The model is empirically validated using roll-call data from the United States, Brazil, and Chile legislatures, which represent diverse legislative dynamics. The analysis aims to capture the complexities of voting and legislative behaviors, resulting in a two-dimensional indicator. This study addresses gaps in current legislative voting models, particularly in contexts with limited party control.</description>

      <title>Structure and Context of Retweet Coordination in the 2022 U.S. Midterm Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to detect coordinated activity in communication networks is an ongoing challenge. Prior approaches emphasize considering any activity exceeding a specific threshold of similarity to be coordinated. However, identifying such a threshold is often arbitrary and can be difficult to distinguish from grassroots organized behavior. In this paper, we investigate a set of Twitter retweeting data collected around the 2022 US midterm elections, using a latent sharing-space model, in which we identify the main components of an association network, thresholded with a k-nearest neighbor criterion. This approach identifies a distribution of association values with different roles in the network at different ranges, where the shape of the distribution suggests a natural place to threshold for coordinated user candidates. We find coordination candidates belonging to two broad categories, one involving music awards and promotion of Korean pop or Taylor Swift, the other being users engaged in political mobilization. In addition, the latent space suggests common motivations for different coordinated groups otherwise fragmented by using an appropriately high threshold criterion for coordination.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Social Networks: Lessons from Bluesky Starter Packs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11605v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microblogging is a crucial mode of online communication. However, launching a new microblogging platform remains challenging, largely due to network effects. This has resulted in entrenched (and undesirable) dominance by established players, such as X/Twitter. To overcome these network effects, Bluesky, an emerging microblogging platform, introduced starter packs -- curated lists of accounts that users can follow with a single click. We ask if starter packs have the potential to tackle the critical problem of social bootstrapping in new online social networks? This paper is the first to address this question: we asses whether starter packs have been indeed helpful in supporting Bluesky growth. Our dataset includes $25.05 \times 10^6$ users and $335.42 \times 10^3$ starter packs with $1.73 \times 10^6$ members, covering the entire lifecycle of Bluesky. We study the usage of these starter packs, their ability to drive network and activity growth, and their potential downsides. We also quantify the benefits of starter packs for members and creators on user visibility and activity while identifying potential challenges. By evaluating starter packs' effectiveness and limitations, we contribute to the broader discourse on platform growth strategies and competitive innovation in the social media landscape.</description>

      <title>From Niche to Mainstream: Community Size and Engagement in Social Media Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The architecture of public discourse has been profoundly reshaped by social media platforms, which mediate interactions at an unprecedented scale and complexity. This study analyzes user behavior across six platforms over 33 years, exploring how the size of conversations and communities influences dialogue dynamics. Our findings reveal that smaller platforms foster richer, more sustained interactions, while larger platforms drive broader but shorter participation. Moreover, we observe that the propensity for users to re-engage in a conversation decreases as community size grows, with niche environments as a notable exception, where participation remains robust. These findings show an interdependence between platform architecture, user engagement, and community dynamics, shedding light on how digital ecosystems shape the structure and quality of public discourse.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics in bounded confidence models with manipulative agents: Moving the Overton window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the opinion dynamics under the influence of manipulative agents. This type of agents is characterized by the fact that their opinions follow a trajectory that does not respond to the dynamics of the model, although it does influence the rest of the normal agents. Simulation has been implemented to study how one manipulative group modifies the natural dynamics of some opinion models of bounded confidence. It is studied what strategies based on the number of manipulative agents and their common opinion trajectory can be carried out by a manipulative group to influence normal agents and attract them to their opinions. In certain weighted models, some effects are observed in which normal agents move in the opposite direction to the manipulator group. Moreover, the conditions which ensure the influence of a manipulative group on a group of normal agents over time are also established for the Hegselmann-Krause model.</description>

      <title>Community Discovery Algorithm Based on Spatio-temporal Graph Embedding in Dynamic Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community discovery is one of the key issues in the study of dynamic social networks. Traditional community discovery algorithms only focus on the establishment and disconnection of connections between nodes, failing to capture deeper factors. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a community discovery algorithm based on spatiotemporal graph embedding (CDA-SGE), which integrates spatial information and evolutions of nodes to comprehensively capture the dynamic features of networks. Specifically, this algorithm employs Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to aggregate latent spatial information, effectively representing the embedding of nodes in space. Temporal evolutions of the nodes are then modeled using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), thereby solving problems such as node dynamism and relationship transmission. Finally, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is applied to cluster dynamic network representations and identify community affiliations of nodes. We then perform simulations on four types of dynamic networks and show that the CDA-SGE outperforms traditional community discovery algorithms in terms of purity, standardized mutual information, heterogeneity, and homogeneity. These results demonstrate the algorithm's superior ability to accurately uncover community structures hidden in dynamic social networks.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Approach for User and Keyword Classification in Controversial Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying the stance of individuals on controversial topics and uncovering their concerns is crucial for social scientists and policymakers. Data from Online Social Networks (OSNs), which serve as a proxy to a representative sample of society, offers an opportunity to classify these stances, discover society's concerns regarding controversial topics, and track the evolution of these concerns over time. Consequently, stance classification in OSNs has garnered significant attention from researchers. However, most existing methods for this task often rely on labelled data and utilise the text of users' posts or the interactions between users, necessitating large volumes of data, considerable processing time, and access to information that is not readily available (e.g. users' followers/followees). This paper proposes a lightweight approach for the stance classification of users and keywords in OSNs, aiming at understanding the collective opinion of individuals and their concerns. Our approach employs a tailored random walk model, requiring just one keyword representing each stance, using solely the keywords in social media posts. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to the baselines, excelling in stance classification of users and keywords, with a running time that, while not the fastest, remains competitive.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Temporal Dynamics of Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) play a crucial role in the rapid detection and mitigation of cyber threats. However, the existing body of literature lacks in-depth analytical studies on the temporal aspects of IoC publication, especially when considering up-to-date datasets related to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). This paper addresses this gap by conducting an analysis of the timeliness and comprehensiveness of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) pertaining to several recent CVEs. The insights derived from this study aim to enhance cybersecurity defense strategies, particularly when dealing with dynamic cyber threats that continually adapt their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Utilizing IoCs sourced from multiple providers, we scrutinize the IoC publication rate. Our analysis delves into how various factors, including the inherent nature of a threat, its evolutionary trajectory, and its observability over time, influence the publication rate of IoCs. Our preliminary findings emphasize the critical need for cyber defenders to maintain a constant state of vigilance in updating their IoCs for any given vulnerability. This vigilance is warranted because the publication rate of IoCs may exhibit fluctuations over time. We observe a recurring pattern akin to an epidemic model, with an initial phase following the public disclosure of a vulnerability characterized by sparse IoC publications, followed by a sudden surge, and subsequently, a protracted period with a slower rate of IoC publication.</description>

      <title>Societal citations undermine the function of the science reward system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citations in the scientific literature system do not simply reflect relationships between knowledge but are influenced by non-objective and societal factors. Citation bias, irresponsible citation, and citation manipulation are widespread and have become a serious and growing problem. However, it has been difficult to assess the consequences of mixing societal factors into the literature system because there was no observable literature system unmixed with societal factors for comparison. In this paper, we construct a mathematical theorem network, representing a logic-based and objective knowledge system, to address this problem. By comparing the mathematical theorem network and the scientific citation networks, we find that these two types of networks are significantly different in their structure and function. In particular, the reward function in citation networks is impaired: The scientific citation network fails to provide more recognition for more disruptive results, while the mathematical theorem network can achieve. We develop a network generation model that can create two types of links$\unicode{x2014}$logical and societal$\unicode{x2014}$to account for these differences. The model parameter $q$, which we call the human influence factor, can control the number of societal links and thus regulate the degree of mixing of societal factors in the networks. Under this design, the model successfully reproduces the differences among real networks. These results suggest that the presence of societal factors undermines the function of the scientific reward system. To improve the status quo, we advocate for reforming the reference list format in papers, urging journals to require authors to separately disclose logical references and social references.</description>

      <title>Local Limits of Small World Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-world networks, known for their high local clustering and short average path lengths, are a fundamental structure in many real-world systems, including social, biological, and technological networks. We apply the theory of local convergence (Benjamini-Schramm convergence) to derive the limiting behavior of the local structures for two of the most commonly studied small-world network models: the Watts-Strogatz model and the Kleinberg model. Establishing local convergence enables us to show that key network measures, such as PageRank, clustering coefficients, and maximum matching size, converge as network size increases with their limits determined by the graph's local structure. Additionally, this framework facilitates the estimation of global phenomena, such as information cascades, using local information from small neighborhoods. As an additional outcome of our results, we observe a critical change in the behavior of the limit exactly when the parameter governing long-range connections in the Kleinberg model crosses the threshold where decentralized search remains efficient, offering a new perspective on why decentralized algorithms fail in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Irony in Emojis: A Comparative Study of Human and LLM Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emojis have become a universal language in online communication, often carrying nuanced and context-dependent meanings. Among these, irony poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its inherent incongruity between appearance and intent. This study examines the ability of GPT-4o to interpret irony in emojis. By prompting GPT-4o to evaluate the likelihood of specific emojis being used to express irony on social media and comparing its interpretations with human perceptions, we aim to bridge the gap between machine and human understanding. Our findings reveal nuanced insights into GPT-4o's interpretive capabilities, highlighting areas of alignment with and divergence from human behavior. Additionally, this research underscores the importance of demographic factors, such as age and gender, in shaping emoji interpretation and evaluates how these factors influence GPT-4o's performance.</description>

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has victimized over 7 million people to date, prompting diverse research efforts. Spatio-temporal models combining mobility data with machine learning have gained attention for disease forecasting. Here, we explore Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN) and Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (GCLSTM), which combine the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with traditional architectures that deal with sequential data. The aim is to forecast future values of COVID-19 cases in Brazil and China by leveraging human mobility networks, whose nodes represent geographical locations and links are flows of vehicles or people. We show that employing backbone extraction to filter out negligible connections in the mobility network enhances predictive stability. Comparing regression and classification tasks demonstrates that binary classification yields smoother, more interpretable results. Interestingly, we observe qualitatively equivalent results for both Brazil and China datasets by introducing sliding windows of variable size and prediction horizons. Compared to prior studies, introducing the sliding window and the network backbone extraction strategies yields improvements of about 80% in root mean squared errors.</description>

      <title>The Value of Nothing: Multimodal Extraction of Human Values Expressed by TikTok Influencers</title>

Abstract: Societal and personal values are transmitted to younger generations through interaction and exposure. Traditionally, children and adolescents learned values from parents, educators, or peers. Nowadays, social platforms serve as a significant channel through which youth (and adults) consume information, as the main medium of entertainment, and possibly the medium through which they learn different values. In this paper we extract implicit values from TikTok movies uploaded by online influencers targeting children and adolescents. We curated a dataset of hundreds of TikTok movies and annotated them according to the Schwartz Theory of Personal Values. We then experimented with an array of Masked and Large language model, exploring how values can be detected. Specifically, we considered two pipelines -- direct extraction of values from video and a 2-step approach in which videos are first converted to elaborated scripts and then values are extracted.
  Achieving state-of-the-art results, we find that the 2-step approach performs significantly better than the direct approach and that using a trainable Masked Language Model as a second step significantly outperforms a few-shot application of a number of Large Language Models. We further discuss the impact of fine-tuning and compare the performance of the different models on identification of values present or contradicted in the TikTok. Finally, we share the first values-annotated dataset of TikTok videos. Our results pave the way to further research on influence and value transmission in video-based social platforms.</description>

      <title>Toward Effective Digraph Representation Learning: A Magnetic Adaptive Propagation based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $q$-parameterized magnetic Laplacian serves as the foundation of directed graph (digraph) convolution, enabling this kind of digraph neural network (MagDG) to encode node features and structural insights by complex-domain message passing. As a generalization of undirected methods, MagDG shows superior capability in modeling intricate web-scale topology. Despite the great success achieved by existing MagDGs, limitations still exist: (1) Hand-crafted $q$: The performance of MagDGs depends on selecting an appropriate $q$-parameter to construct suitable graph propagation equations in the complex domain. This parameter tuning, driven by downstream tasks, limits model flexibility and significantly increases manual effort. (2) Coarse Message Passing: Most approaches treat all nodes with the same complex-domain propagation and aggregation rules, neglecting their unique digraph contexts. This oversight results in sub-optimal performance. To address the above issues, we propose two key techniques: (1) MAP is crafted to be a plug-and-play complex-domain propagation optimization strategy in the context of digraph learning, enabling seamless integration into any MagDG to improve predictions while enjoying high running efficiency. (2) MAP++ is a new digraph learning framework, further incorporating a learnable mechanism to achieve adaptively edge-wise propagation and node-wise aggregation in the complex domain for better performance. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that MAP enjoys flexibility for it can be incorporated with any MagDG, and scalability as it can deal with web-scale digraphs. MAP++ achieves SOTA predictive performance on 4 different downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward Scalable Graph Unlearning: A Node Influence Maximization based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, as a pivotal technology for enhancing model robustness and data privacy, has garnered significant attention in prevalent web mining applications, especially in thriving graph-based scenarios. However, most existing graph unlearning (GU) approaches face significant challenges due to the intricate interactions among web-scale graph elements during the model training: (1) The gradient-driven node entanglement hinders the complete knowledge removal in response to unlearning requests; (2) The billion-level graph elements in the web scenarios present inevitable scalability issues. To break the above limitations, we open up a new perspective by drawing a connection between GU and conventional social influence maximization. To this end, we propose Node Influence Maximization (NIM) through the decoupled influence propagation model and fine-grained influence function in a scalable manner, which is crafted to be a plug-and-play strategy to identify potential nodes affected by unlearning entities. This approach enables offline execution independent of GU, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into most GU methods to improve their unlearning performance. Based on this, we introduce Scalable Graph Unlearning (SGU) as a new fine-tuned framework, which balances the forgetting and reasoning capability of the unlearned model by entity-specific optimizations. Extensive experiments on 14 datasets, including large-scale ogbn-papers100M, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, NIM enhances the forgetting capability of most GU methods, while SGU achieves comprehensive SOTA performance and maintains scalability.</description>

      <title>Network-informed Prompt Engineering against Organized Astroturf Campaigns under Extreme Class Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting organized political campaigns is of paramount importance in fighting against disinformation on social media. Existing approaches for the identification of such organized actions employ techniques mostly from network science, graph machine learning and natural language processing. Their ultimate goal is to analyze the relationships and interactions (e.g. re-posting) among users and the textual similarities of their posts. Despite their effectiveness in recognizing astroturf campaigns, these methods face significant challenges, notably the class imbalance in available training datasets. To mitigate this issue, recent methods usually resort to data augmentation or increasing the number of positive samples, which may not always be feasible or sufficient in real-world settings. Following a different path, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for identifying astroturf campaigns based solely on large language models (LLMs), introducing a Balanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Balanced RAG) component. Our approach first gives both textual information concerning the posts (in our case tweets) and the user interactions of the social network as input to a language model. Then, through prompt engineering and the proposed Balanced RAG method, it effectively detects coordinated disinformation campaigns on X (Twitter). The proposed framework does not require any training or fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, by strategically harnessing the strengths of prompt engineering and Balanced RAG, it facilitates LLMs to overcome the effects of class imbalance and effectively identify coordinated political campaigns. The experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the proposed prompt engineering and Balanced RAG methods, our framework outperforms the traditional graph-based baselines, achieving 2x-3x improvements in terms of precision, recall and F1 scores.</description>

      <title>Network compression with configuration models and the minimum description length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random network models, constrained to reproduce specific statistical features, are often used to represent and analyze network data and their mathematical descriptions. Chief among them, the configuration model constrains random networks by their degree distribution and is foundational to many areas of network science. However, configuration models and their variants are often selected based on intuition or mathematical and computational simplicity rather than on statistical evidence. To evaluate the quality of a network representation, we need to consider both the amount of information required to specify a random network model and the probability of recovering the original data when using the model as a generative process. To this end, we calculate the approximate size of network ensembles generated by the popular configuration model and its generalizations, including versions accounting for degree correlations and centrality layers. We then apply the minimum description length principle as a model selection criterion over the resulting nested family of configuration models. Using a dataset of over 100 networks from various domains, we find that the classic Configuration Model is generally preferred on networks with an average degree above ten, while a Layered Configuration Model constrained by a centrality metric offers the most compact representation of the majority of sparse networks.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Node Embedding Distances Through $n$-order Proximity Neighbourhoods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of node representation learning the task of interpreting latent dimensions has become a prominent, well-studied research topic. The contribution of this work focuses on appraising the interpretability of another rarely-exploited feature of node embeddings increasingly utilised in recommendation and consumption diversity studies: inter-node embedded distances. Introducing a new method to measure how understandable the distances between nodes are, our work assesses how well the proximity weights derived from a network before embedding relate to the node closeness measurements after embedding. Testing several classical node embedding models, our findings reach a conclusion familiar to practitioners albeit rarely cited in literature - the matrix factorisation model SVD is the most interpretable through 1, 2 and even higher-order proximities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the potential fragility of democratic elections given modern information-communication technologies (ICT) in the Web 2.0 era. Our work provides an explanation for the cascading attrition of public officials recently in the United States and offers potential policy interventions from a dynamic system's perspective. We propose that micro-level heterogeneity across individuals within crucial institutions leads to vulnerabilities of election support systems at the macro scale. Our analysis provides comparative statistics to measure the fragility of systems against targeted harassment, disinformation campaigns, and other adversarial manipulations that are now cheaper to scale and deploy. Our analysis also informs policy interventions that seek to retain public officials and increase voter turnout. We show how limited resources (for example, salary incentives to public officials and targeted interventions to increase voter turnout) can be allocated at the population level to improve these outcomes and maximally enhance democratic resilience. On the one hand, structural and individual heterogeneity cause systemic fragility that adversarial actors can exploit, but also provide opportunities for effective interventions that offer significant global improvements from limited and localized actions.</description>

      <title>Narratives of War: Ukrainian Memetic Warfare on Twitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has seen an intensification in the use of social media by governmental actors in cyber warfare. Wartime communication via memes has been a successful strategy used not only by independent accounts such as @uamemesforces, but also-for the first time in a full-scale interstate war-by official Ukrainian government accounts such as @Ukraine and @DefenceU. We study this prominent example of memetic warfare through the lens of its narratives, and find them to be a key component of success: tweets with a 'victim' narrative garner twice as many retweets. However, malevolent narratives focusing on the enemy resonate more than those about heroism or victims with countries providing more assistance to Ukraine. Our findings present a nuanced examination of Ukraine's influence operations and of the worldwide response to it, thus contributing new insights into the evolution of socio-technical systems in times of war.</description>

      <title>OpenFGL: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Federated Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) is a promising distributed training paradigm for graph neural networks across multiple local systems without direct data sharing. This approach inherently involves large-scale distributed graph processing, which closely aligns with the challenges and research focuses of graph-based data systems. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from real-world applications, spanning various research backgrounds and settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 42 graph datasets from 18 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize different graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Our empirical results demonstrate the capabilities of FGL while also highlighting its potential limitations, providing valuable insights for future research in this growing field, particularly in fostering greater interdisciplinary collaboration between FGL and data systems.</description>

      <title>ValuesRAG: Enhancing Cultural Alignment Through Retrieval-Augmented Contextual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge due to their tendency to embed Western-centric biases from training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness issues in cross-cultural contexts. Recent approaches, such as role-assignment and few-shot learning, often struggle with reliable cultural alignment as they heavily rely on pre-trained knowledge, lack scalability, and fail to capture nuanced cultural values effectively. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. Subsequently, we curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. ValuesRAG consistently outperforms baseline methods, both in the main experiment and in the ablation study where only the values summary was provided. Notably, ValuesRAG demonstrates an accuracy of 21% improvement over other baseline methods, highlighting its potential to foster culturally aligned AI systems and enhance the inclusivity of AI-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Keeping Score: A Quantitative Analysis of How the CHI Community Appreciates Its Milestones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ACM CHI Conference has a tradition of citing its intellectual heritage. At the same time, we know CHI is highly diverse and evolving. In this highly dynamic context, it is not clear how the CHI community continues to appreciate its milestones (within and outside of CHI). We present an investigation into how the community's citations to milestones have evolved over 43 years of CHI Proceedings (1981-2024). Forgetting curves plotted for each year suggest that milestones are slowly fading from the CHI community's collective memory. However, the picture is more nuanced when we trace citations to the top-cited milestones over time. We identify three distinct types of milestones cited at CHI, a typology of milestone contributions, and define the Milestone Coefficient as a metric to assess the impact of milestone papers on a continuous scale. Further, we provide empirical evidence of a Matthew effect at CHI. We discuss the broader ramifications for the CHI community and the field of HCI.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Event Prediction with Self-adaptive Anchor Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event prediction tasks often handle spatio-temporal data distributed in a large spatial area. Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</description>
