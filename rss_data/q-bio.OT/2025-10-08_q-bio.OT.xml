      <title>Disentangling peri-urban river hypoxia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Episodes of low dissolved oxygen concentration--hypoxia--threaten the functioning of and the services provided by aquatic ecosystems, particularly those of urban rivers. Here, we disentangle oxygen-related processes in the highly modified Elbe River flowing through the major German city of Hamburg, where low oxygen levels are frequently observed. We use a process-based biochemical model that describes particulate and dissolved organic matter, micro-algae, their pathogens, and the key reactions that produce or consume oxygen: photosynthesis, re-aeration, respiration, mineralization, and nitrification. The model analysis reveals pronounced spatial variability in the relative importance of these processes. Photosynthesis and respiration are more prominent upstream of the city, while mineralization, nitrification, and re-aeration prevail downstream. The city, characterized by rapid changes in bathymetry, marks a transitional area: pathogen-related micro-algal lysis may increase organic material, explaining the shift towards heterotrophic processes downstream. As the primary driver of seasonal changes, the model analysis reveals a differential temperature sensitivity of biochemical rates. These results may be extrapolated to other urban rivers, and also provide valuable information for estuarine water quality management.</description>

      <title>The Software Observatory: aggregating and analysing software metadata for trend computation and FAIR assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the ever-changing realm of research software development, it is crucial for the scientific community to grasp current trends to identify gaps that can potentially hinder scientific progress. The adherence to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles can serve as a proxy to understand those trends and provide a mechanism to propose specific actions.
  The Software Observatory at OpenEBench (https://openebench.bsc.es/observatory) is a novel web portal that consolidates software metadata from various sources, offering comprehensive insights into critical research software aspects. Our platform enables users to analyse trends, identify patterns and advancements within the Life Sciences research software ecosystem, and understand its evolution over time. It also evaluates research software according to FAIR principles for research software, providing scores for different indicators.
  Users have the ability to visualise this metadata at different levels of granularity, ranging from the entire software landscape to specific communities to individual software entries through the FAIRsoft Evaluator. Indeed, the FAIRsoft Evaluator component streamlines the assessment process, helping developers efficiently evaluate and obtain guidance to improve their software's FAIRness.
  The Software Observatory represents a valuable resource for researchers and software developers, as well as stakeholders, promoting better software development practices and adherence to FAIR principles for research software.</description>
