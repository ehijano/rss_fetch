      <title>Hamiltonian dynamics of Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the impact of Hamiltonian dynamics on the interaction graph of Boolean networks. Three types of dynamics are considered: maximum height, Hamiltonian cycle, and an intermediate dynamic between these two. The study addresses how these dynamics influence the connectivity of the graph and the existence of variables that depend on all other variables in the system. Additionally, a family of regulatory Boolean networks capable of describing these three Hamiltonian behaviors is introduced, highlighting their specific properties and limitations. The results provide theoretical tools for modeling complex systems and contribute to the understanding of dynamic interactions in Boolean networks.</description>

      <title>Extremal chemical graphs of maximum degree at most 3 for 33 degree-based topological indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider chemical graphs that are defined as connected graphs of maximum degree at most 3. We characterize the extremal graphs, meaning those that maximize or minimize 33 degree-based topological indices. This study shows that five graph families are sufficient to characterize the extremal graphs of 29 of these 33 indices. In other words, the extremal properties of this set of degree-based topological indices vary very little.</description>

      <title>Prime Multiple Missing Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture remains open for nearly three centuries. Recently Goldbach graphs are introduced to relate the problem with the literature of Graph Theory. It is shown that the connectedness of the graphs is equivalent to the affirmative answer of the conjecture. Some modified version of the graphs, say, near Goldbach graphs are shown to be Hamiltonian for small number of vertices. In this context, we introduce a class of graphs, namely, prime multiple missing graphs such that near Goldbach graphs are finite intersections of these graphs. We study these graphs for primes 3,5 and in general for any odd prime p. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 3 and Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. Next the intersection of prime multiple missing graphs for primes 3 and 5 are studied. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 4 and they are also Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. We observe that the diameters of finite Goldbach graphs and near Goldbach graphs are bounded by 5 (up to 10000 vertices). We believe further study on these graphs with big data analysis will help to understand structures of near Goldbach graphs.</description>

      <title>Coloring of ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graph with $\omega(G)\geq 3$, then $\chi(G)\leq \max\{6, \omega(G)\}$, and that the bound is tight for $\omega(G)\notin \{4,5\}$. These extend the results known for the class of ($P_2+P_3$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, improves the bound of Chen and Zhang [arXiv:2412.14524[math.CO], 2024] given for the class of ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, partially answers a question of Ju and Huang [Theor. Comp. Sci. 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] on `near optimal colorable graphs', and partially answers a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished) on the chromatic bound for ($P_7$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Normalizations of factorizations over convex cones and their effects on extension complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Factorizations over cones and their duals play central roles for many areas of mathematics and computer science. One of the reasons behind this is the ability to find a representation for various objects using a well-structured family of cones, where the representation is captured by the factorizations over these cones. Several major questions about factorizations over cones remain open even for such well-structured families of cones as non-negative orthants and positive semidefinite cones. Having said that, we possess a far better understanding of factorizations over non-negative orthants and positive semidefinite cones than over other families of cones. One of the key properties that led to this better understanding is the ability to normalize factorizations, i.e., to guarantee that the norms of the vectors involved in the factorizations are bounded in terms of an input and in terms of a constant dependent on the given cone. Our work aims at understanding which cones guarantee that factorizations over them can be normalized, and how this effects extension complexity of polytopes over such cones.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although, both double-spending and selfish-mining attacks have been extensively studied since the ``Bitcoin'' whitepaper of Nakamoto and the ``majority is not enough'' paper of Eyal and Sirer, there has been no rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack that combines the two, except for the complicated MDP models. In this paper, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, there is a risk of double-spending which comes at no-cost to the adversary. The result can be seen as a guide for picking $k$ in the $k$-confirmation rule in a blockchain design. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the risk of double-spending is. We provide the minimum double-spend value needed for an attack to be profitable in the regimes where the scheme is less profitable than honest mining. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability. Finally, we evaluate the results and provide the optimal and the maximum stubbornness levels for each parameter regime as well as the revenue. As a case study, with Bitcoin's $k=6$ block confirmation rule, we evaluate the revenue and double-spending risk of the attacks for each pool parameter.</description>

      <title>On Approximate Reconfigurability of Label Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a two-prover game $G$ and its two satisfying labelings $\psi_\mathsf{ini}$ and $\psi_\mathsf{tar}$, the Label Cover Reconfiguration problem asks whether $\psi_\mathsf{ini}$ can be transformed into $\psi_\mathsf{tar}$ by repeatedly changing the label of a single vertex while preserving any intermediate labeling satisfying $G$. We consider its optimization version by relaxing the feasibility of labelings, referred to as Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration: We are allowed to pass through any non-satisfying labelings, but required to maximize the ``soundness error,'' which is defined as the minimum fraction of satisfied edges during transformation from $\psi_\mathsf{ini}$ to $\psi_\mathsf{tar}$. Since the parallel repetition theorem of Raz (SIAM J. Comput., 1998), which implies $\mathbf{NP}$-hardness of approximating Label Cover within any constant factor, gives strong inapproximability results for many $\mathbf{NP}$-hard problems, one may think of using Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration to derive inapproximability results for reconfiguration problems. We prove the following results on Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration, which display different trends from those of Label Cover and the parallel repetition theorem:
  $\bullet$ Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration can be approximated within a factor of $\frac{1}{4} - o(1)$ for some restricted graph classes, including biregular graphs, balanced bipartite graphs with no isolated vertices, and superconstant average degree graphs.
  $\bullet$ A ``naive'' parallel repetition of Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration does not decrease the soundness error for every two-prover game.
  $\bullet$ Label Cover Reconfiguration on projection games can be decided in polynomial time.
  Our results suggest that a reconfiguration analogue of the parallel repetition theorem is unlikely.</description>

      <title>Skip Letters for Short Supersequence of All Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A supersequence over a finite set is a sequence that contains as subsequence all permutations of the set. This paper defines an infinite array of methods to create supersequences of decreasing lengths. This yields the shortest known supersequences over larger sets. It also provides the best results asymptotically. It is based on a general proof using a new property called strong completeness. The same technique also can be used to prove existing supersequences which combines the old and new ones into an unified conceptual framework.</description>

      <title>Computing Subset Vertex Covers in $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a natural generalization of Vertex Cover: the Subset Vertex Cover problem, which is to decide for a graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset $T\subseteq V$ and integer $k$, if $V$ has a subset $S$ of size at most $k$, such that $S$ contains at least one end-vertex of every edge incident to a vertex of $T$. A graph is $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. We solve two open problems from the literature by proving that Subset Vertex Cover is NP-complete on subcubic (claw,diamond)-free planar graphs and on $2$-unipolar graphs, a subclass of $2P_3$-free weakly chordal graphs. Our results show for the first time that Subset Vertex Cover is computationally harder than Vertex Cover (under P $\neq$ NP). We also prove new polynomial time results, some of which follow from a reduction to Vertex Cover restricted to classes of probe graphs. We first give a dichotomy on graphs where $G[T]$ is $H$-free. Namely, we show that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable on graphs $G$, for which $G[T]$ is $H$-free, if $H=sP_1+tP_2$ and NP-complete otherwise. Moreover, we prove that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable for $(sP_1+P_2+P_3)$-free graphs and bounded mim-width graphs. By combining our new results with known results we obtain a partial complexity classification for Subset Vertex Cover on $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Reducing Matroid Optimization to Basis Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matroids provide one of the most elegant structures for algorithm design. This is best identified by the Edmonds-Rado theorem relating the success of the simple greedy algorithm to the anatomy of the optimal basis of a matroid [Edm71; Rad57]. As a response, much energy has been devoted to understanding a matroid's computational properties. Yet, less is understood where parallel algorithms are concerned. In response, we initiate the study of parallel matroid optimization in the adaptive complexity model [BS18]. First, we reexamine Bor\r{u}vka's classical minimum weight spanning tree algorithm [Bor26b; Bor26a] in the abstract language of matroid theory, and identify a new certificate of optimality for the basis of any matroid as a result. In particular, a basis is optimal if and only if it contains the points of minimum weight in every circuit of the dual matroid. Hence, we can witnesses whether any specific point belongs to the optimal basis via a test for local optimality in a circuit of the dual matroid, thereby revealing a general design paradigm towards parallel matroid optimization. To instantiate this paradigm, we use the special structure of a binary matroid to identify an optimization scheme with low adaptivity. Here, our key technical step is reducing optimization to the simpler task of basis search in the binary matroid, using only logarithmic overhead of adaptive rounds of queries to independence oracles. Consequentially, we compose our reduction with the parallel basis search method of [KUW88] to obtain an algorithm for finding the optimal basis of a binary matroid terminating in sublinearly many adaptive rounds of queries to an independence oracle. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first algorithm for matroid optimization to outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of adaptive complexity in the independence query model without assuming the matroid is encoded by a graph.</description>
