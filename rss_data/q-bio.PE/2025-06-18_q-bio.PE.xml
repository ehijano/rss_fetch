      <title>Understanding the rift between update rules in Evolutionary Graph Theory: The intrinsic death rate drives star graphs from amplifying to suppressing natural selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary graph theory is the study of evolutionary dynamics in structured populations. A well-known problem in evolutionary graph theory is that the spread of mutation (measured by fixation probability) is impacted by the graph type chosen and the update rule. For example, the star graph is an amplifier of natural selection under the birth-death with fitness on birth (Bd) update rule but a suppressor of natural selection under the death-birth with fitness on birth (dB) update rule. A continuous-time EGT model has been found to replicate Bd and dB results as special cases. Using this model, we show that changing the natural (intrinsic) death rate can cause a shift from Bd to dB dynamics. Assuming the mutant is advantageous, we show that if the natural death rate is greater than $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ the star is a suppressor, where $N$ is the number of nodes. As $N \longrightarrow \infty$, the natural death rate required to drive the star to a suppressor tends towards zero, so as the size of the graph increases, the star graph is likely to be suppressing for any non-zero natural death rate.</description>

      <title>Hidden Markov modelling of spatio-temporal dynamics of measles in 1750-1850 Finland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real world spatio-temporal datasets, and phenomena related to them, are often challenging to visualise or gain a general overview of. In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</description>
