      <title>Hilbert Polynomials of Noncanonical Orthogonal Oscillator Representations of $sl(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying Fourier transformations to the natural orthogonal oscillator representations of special linear Lie algebras, Luo and the second author (2013) obtained a large family of infinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebras on the homogeneous solutions of the Laplace equation. In our earlier work, we proved that the associated varieties of these irreducible representations are the intersection of determinantal varieties. In this paper, we find the Hilbert polynomial $\mathfrak p_{ M}(k)$ of these associated varieties. Moreover, we show that the Hilbert polynomial $\mathfrak p_{ M, {M_0}}(k)$ of such an irreducible module $M$ with respect to any generating subspace $M_0$ satisfies $\mathfrak p_{_M}(k)\leq \mathfrak p_{ M, {M_0}}(k)$ for sufficiently large positive integer $k$ and find a necessary and sufficient condition that the equality holds. Furthermore, we explicitly determine the leading term of $\mathfrak p_{ M, {M_0}}(k)$, which is independent of the choice of $M_0$.</description>

      <title>The sign character of the triagonal fermionic coinvariant ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the trigraded multiplicity of the sign character of the triagonal fermionic coinvariant ring $R_n^{(0,3)}$. As a corollary, this proves a conjecture of Bergeron (2020) that the dimension of the sign character of $R_n^{(0,3)}$ is $n^2-n+1$. We also give an explicit formula for double hook characters in the diagonal fermionic coinvariant ring $R_n^{(0,2)}$, and discuss methods towards calculating the sign character of $R_n^{(0,4)}$. Finally, we give a multigraded refinement of a conjecture of Bergeron (2020) that the dimension of the sign character of the $(1,3)$-bosonic-fermionic coinvariant ring $R_n^{(1,3)}$ is $\frac{1}{2}F_{3n}$, where $F_n$ is a Fibonacci number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space for GL_n or SL_n is a Coulomb branch, which confirms a conjecture of Bourget-Dancer-Grimminger-Hanany-Zhong. In particular, we show that the ring of functions on the cotangent bundle of the parabolic base affine space of GL_n or SL_n is finitely generated.
  We prove this by showing that, if we are given a map $H \to G$ of complex reductive groups and a representation of $G$ satisfying an assumption we call gluable, then the Coulomb branch for the induced representation of $H$ is obtained from the corresponding Coulomb branch for $G$ by a certain Hamiltonian reduction procedure. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branch associated to any quiver with no loops can be obtained from Coulomb branches associated to quivers with exactly two vertices using this procedure.</description>

      <title>The $q$-Racah polynomials from scalar products of Bethe states II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Leonard triples is applied to the derivation of normalized scalar products of on-shell and off-shell Bethe states generated from a Leonard pair. The scalar products take the form of linear combinations of $q$-Racah polynomials with coefficients depending on the off-shell parameters. Upon specializations, explicit solutions for the corresponding Belliard-Slavnov linear systems are obtained. It implies the existence of a determinant formula in terms of inhomogeneous Bethe roots for the $q$-Racah polynomials. Also, a set of relations that determines solutions (Bethe roots) of the corresponding Bethe equations of inhomogeneous type in terms of solutions of Bethe equations of homogenous type is obtained.</description>

Abstract: We study the first extension groups between Verma modules. There was a conjecture which claims that the dimensions of the higher extension groups between Verma modules are the coefficients of $R$-polynomials defined by Kazhdan-Lusztig. This conjecture was known as the Gabber-Joseph conjecture (although Gebber and Joseph did not state.) However, Boe gives a counterexample to this conjecture. In this paper, we study how far are the dimensions of extension groups from the coefficients of $R$-polynomials.</description>

      <title>Parameters of Hecke algebras for Bernstein components of p-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.13113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a reductive group over a non-archimedean local field F. Consider an arbitrary Bernstein block Rep(G)^s in the category of complex smooth G-representations. In earlier work the author showed that there exists an affine Hecke algebra H(O,G) whose category of right modules is closely related to Rep(G)^s. In many cases this is in fact an equivalence of categories, like for Iwahori-spherical representations.
  In this paper we study the q-parameters of the affine Hecke algebras H(O,G). We compute them in many cases, in particular for principal series representations of quasi-split groups and for classical groups.
  Lusztig conjectured that the q-parameters are always integral powers of q_F and that they coincide with the q-parameters coming from some Bernstein block of unipotent representations. We reduce this conjecture to the case of simple p-adic groups, and we prove it for most of those.</description>

      <title>Graded Hecke algebras, constructible sheaves and the p-adic Kazhdan--Lusztig conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.03196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graded Hecke algebras can be constructed in terms of equivariant cohomology and constructible sheaves on nilpotent cones. In earlier work, their standard modules and their irreducible modules where realized with such geometric methods.
  We pursue this setup to study properties of module categories of (twisted) graded Hecke algebras, in particular what happens geometrically upon formal completion with respect to a central character. We prove a version of the Kazhdan--Lusztig conjecture for (twisted) graded Hecke algebras. It expresses the multiplicity of an irreducible module in a standard module as the multiplicity of an equivariant local system in an equivariant perverse sheaf.
  This is applied to smooth representations of reductive p-adic groups. Under some conditions, we verify the p-adic Kazhdan--Lusztig conjecture from [Vogan]. Here the equivariant constructible sheaves live on certain varieties of Langlands parameters. The involved conditions are checked for substantial classes of groups and representations.</description>

      <title>Hochschild homology of reductive $p$-adic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.06435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a reductive $p$-adic group $G$, its (complex-valued) Hecke algebra $H(G)$ and the Harish-Chandra--Schwartz algebra $S(G)$. We compute the Hochschild homology groups of $H(G)$ and of $S(G)$, and we describe the outcomes in several ways.
  Our main tools are algebraic families of smooth $G$-representations. With those we construct maps from $HH_n (H(G))$ and $HH_n (S(G))$ to modules of differential $n$-forms on affine varieties. For $n = 0$ this provides a description of the cocentres of these algebras in terms of nice linear functions on the Grothendieck group of finite length (tempered) $G$-representations.
  It is known from earlier work that every Bernstein ideal $H(G)^s$ of $H(G)$ is closely related to a crossed product algebra of the from $O(T) \rtimes W$. Here $O(T)$ denotes the regular functions on the variety $T$ of unramified characters of a Levi subgroup $L$ of $G$, and $W$ is a finite group acting on $T$. We make this relation even stronger by establishing an isomorphism between $HH_* (H(G)^s)$ and $HH_* (O(T) \rtimes W)$, although we have to say that in some cases it is necessary to twist $C[W]$ by a 2-cocycle.
  Similarly we prove that the Hochschild homology of the two-sided ideal $S(G)^s$ of $S(G)$ is isomorphic to $HH_* (C^\infty (T_u) \rtimes W)$, where $T_u$ denotes the Lie group of unitary unramified characters of $L$. In these pictures of $HH_* (H(G))$ and $HH_* (S(G))$ we also show how the Bernstein centre of $H(G)$ acts.
  Finally, we derive similar expressions for the (periodic) cyclic homology groups of $H(G)$ and of $S(G)$ and we relate that to topological K-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a quasi-split reductive group over a non-archimedean local field. We establish a local Langlands correspondence for all irreducible smooth complex G-representations in the principal series. The parametrization map is injective, and its image is an explicitly described set of enhanced L-parameters. Our correspondence is determined by the choice of a Whittaker datum for G, and it is canonical given that choice.
  We show that our parametrization satisfies many expected properties, among others with respect to the enhanced L-parameters of generic representations, temperedness, cuspidal supports and central characters. Along the way we characterize genericity in terms of representations of an affine Hecke algebra.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Jantzen filtrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a monoidal analogue of Jantzen filtrations in the framework of monoidal abelian categories with generic braidings. It leads to a deformation of the multiplication of the Grothendieck ring. We conjecture, and we prove in many remarkable situations, that this deformation is associative so that our construction yields a quantization of the Grothendieck ring as well as analogs of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. As a first main example, for finite-dimensional representations of simply-laced quantum loop algebras, we prove the associativity and we establish that the resulting quantization coincides with the quantum Grothendieck ring constructed by Nakajima and Varagnolo-Vasserot in a geometric manner. Hence, it yields a unified representation-theoretic interpretation of the quantum Grothendieck ring. As a second main example, we establish an analogous result for a monoidal category of finite-dimensional modules over symmetric quiver Hecke algebras categorifying the coordinate ring of a unipotent group associated with a Weyl group element. We obtain various applications, in particular on the homological structure of representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In representation theory of algebras, there exist two types of mutation pairs: rigid type (cluster-tilting mutations by Iyama-Yoshino) and simple-minded type (mutations of simple-minded systems by Sim\~oes-Pauksztello). It is known that such mutation pairs induce triangulated categories, however, these facts have been proved in different ways. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ''mutation triples'', which is a simultaneous generalization of two different types of mutation pairs as well as concentric twin cotorsion pairs. We present two main theorems concerning mutation triples. The first theorem is that mutation triples induce pretriangulated categories. The second one is that pretriangulated categories induced by mutation triples become triangulated categories if they satisfy an additional condition (MT4).</description>

      <title>Geometric rigidity of simple modules for algebraic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let k be a field, let G be an affine algebraic k-group and V a finite-dimensional G-module. We say V is rigid if the socle series and radical series coincide for the action of G on each indecomposable summand of V; say V is geometrically rigid (resp. absolutely rigid) if V is rigid after base change of G and V to k (resp. any field extension of k). We show that all simple G-modules are geometrically rigid, though not in general absolutely rigid. More precisely, we show that if V is a simple G-module, then there is a finite purely inseparable extension kV /k naturally attached to V such that V is absolutely rigid as a G-module after base change to kV. The proof turns on an investigation of algebras of the form K otimes E where K and E are field extensions of k; we give an example of such an algebra which is not rigid as a module over itself. We establish the existence of the purely inseparable field extension kV /k through an analogous version for artinian algebras.
  In the second half of the paper we apply recent results on the structure and representation theory of pseudo-reductive groups to give a concrete description of kV when G is smooth and connected. Namely, we combine the main structure theorem of the Conrad-Prasad classification of pseudo-reductive G together with our previous high weight theory. For V a simple G-module, we calculate the minimal field of definition of the geometric Jacobson radical of EndG(V) in terms of the high weight of V and the Conrad-Prasad classification data; this gives a concrete construction of the field kV as a subextension of the minimal field of definition of the geometric unipotent radical of G. We also observe that the Conrad-Prasad classification can be used to hone the dimension formula for V we had previously established; we also use it to give a description of EndG(V) which includes a dimension formula.</description>

      <title>On modular invariance of quantum affine $W$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find modular transformations of normalized characters for the following $W$-algebras:
  (a) $W^{min}_k(\frak{g})$, where $\frak{g}=D_n \, (n \geq 4)$, or $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$, and $k$ is a negative integer $\geq -2$, or $\geq -\frac{h^{\vee}}{6}-1$, respectively;
  (b) quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the $\hat{\frak{g}}$-module $L(k\Lambda_0)$, where $\frak{g}$ is a simple Lie algebra, $f$ is its non-zero nilpotent element, and $k$ is a principal admissible level with the denominator $u &gt; \theta(x)$, where $2x$ is the Dynkin characteristic of $f$ and $\theta$ is the highest root of $\frak{g}$.
  We prove that these vertex algebras are modular invariant. A conformal vertex algebra is called modular invariant if its character $tr_V q^{L_0-c/24}$ converges to a holomorphic modular function in the complex upper half-plane on a congruence subgroup. We find explicit formulas for their characters. Modular invariance of $V$ is important since, in particular, conjecturally it implies that $V$ is simple, and that $V$ is rational, provided that it is lisse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graded Hecke algebras can be constructed geometrically, with constructible sheaves and equivariant cohomology. The input consists of a complex reductive group G (possibly disconnected) and a cuspidal local system on a nilpotent orbit for a Levi subgroup of G. We prove that every such "geometric" graded Hecke algebra is naturally isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a certain G x C*-equivariant semisimple complex of sheaves on the nilpotent cone $g_N$.
  From there we provide an algebraic description of the G x C*-equivariant bounded derived category of constructible sheaves on $g_N$. Namely, it is equivalent with the bounded derived category of finitely generated differential graded modules of a suitable direct sum of graded Hecke algebras. This can be regarded as a categorification of graded Hecke algebras.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}_2$ be the Lie algebra of polynomial Hamiltonian vector fields on the symplectic plane. Let $X$ be the moduli space of stable Higgs bundles of fixed relatively prime rank and degree, or more generally the moduli space of stable parabolic Higgs bundles of arbitrary rank and degree for a generic stability condition. Let $H^*(X)$ be the cohomology with rational coefficients. Using the operations of cup-product by tautological classes and Hecke correspondences we construct an action of $\mathcal{H}_2$ on $H^*(X)[x,y]$, where $x$ and $y$ are formal variables. We show that the perverse filtration on $H^*(X)$ coincides with the filtration canonically associated to $\mathfrak{sl}_2\subset \mathcal{H}_2$ and deduce the $P=W$ conjecture of de Cataldo-Hausel-Migliorini.</description>
