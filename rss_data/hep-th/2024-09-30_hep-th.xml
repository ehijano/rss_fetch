      <title>Casimirs of the Virasoro Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly solve a recurrence relation due to Feigin and Fuchs to obtain the Casimirs of the Virasoro algebra in terms of the inverse of the Shapovalov form. Combined with our recent result for the inverse Shapovalov form, this allows us to write the Casimir operators as linear combinations of products of singular vectors.</description>

      <title>Dual Dressed Black Holes as the end point of the Charged Superradiant instability in ${\cal N} = 4$ Yang Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged Black holes in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ suffer from superradiant instabilities over a range of energies. Hairy black hole solutions (constructed within gauged supergravity) have previously been proposed as endpoints to this instability. We demonstrate that these hairy black holes are themselves unstable to the emission of large dual giant gravitons. We propose that the endpoint to this instability is given by Dual Dressed Black Holes (DDBH)s; configurations consisting of one, two, or three very large dual giant gravitons surrounding a core $AdS$ black hole with one, two, or three $SO(6)$ chemical potentials equal to unity. The dual giants each live at $AdS$ radial coordinates of order $\sqrt{N}$ and each carry charge of order $N^2$. The large separation makes DDBHs a very weakly interacting mix of their components and allows for a simple computation of their thermodynamics. We conjecture that DDBHs dominate the phase diagram of ${\cal N}=4$ Yang-Mills over a range of energies around the BPS plane, and provide an explicit construction of this phase diagram, briefly discussing the interplay with supersymmetry. We develop the quantum description of dual giants around black hole backgrounds and explicitly verify that DDBHs are stable to potential tunneling instabilities, precisely when the chemical potentials of the core black holes equal unity. We also construct the 10-dimensional DDBH supergravity solutions.</description>

      <title>N=2 Heterotic Strings Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that $1+1$ dimensional vacua of the $(0,2)$ heterotic string have many properties in common with more recently studied physical systems. The free theory exhibits a symmetric product CFT structure. The single-string Hilbert space splits into sectors labeled by the string winding, $w$, that contain purely left-moving (for $w&gt;0$) and right-moving (for $w&lt;0$) excitations. These sectors exhibit infinite-dimensional left and right-moving symmetry algebras, respectively, with central extensions that depend on $w$. String interactions between left and right-movers appear to lead to a $T\bar T$ deformation of the free theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum information and the C-theorem in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-theoretic methods have led to significant advances in nonperturbative quantum field theory in flat space. In this work, we show that these ideas can be generalized to field theories in a fixed de Sitter space. Focusing on 1+1-dimensional field theories, we derive a boosted strong subadditivity inequality in de Sitter, and show that it implies a C-theorem for renormalization group flows. Additionally, using the relative entropy, we establish a Lorentzian bound on the entanglement and thermal entropies for a field theory inside the static patch. Finally, we discuss possible connections with recent developments using unitarity methods.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping string models with entanglement minimization and Machine-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to bootstrapping string-like theories by exploiting a local crossing symmetric dispersion relation and field redefinition ambiguities. This approach enables us to use mass-level truncation and to go beyond the dual resonance hypothesis. We consider both open and closed strings, focusing mainly on open tree-level amplitudes with integer-spaced spectrum, and two leading Wilson coefficients as inputs. Using entanglement minimization in the form of the minimum of the first finite moment of linear entropy or entangling power, we get an excellent approximation to the superstring amplitudes, including the leading and sub-leading Regge trajectories. We find other interesting S-matrices which do not obey the duality hypothesis, but exhibit a transition from Regge behaviour to power law behaviour in the high energy limit. Finally, we also examine Machine-Learning techniques to do bootstrap and discuss potential advantages over the present approach.</description>

      <title>The dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for a holographic superconductor: Finite coupling corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic superconductor is the holographic dual of superconductors. We recently identified the dual Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors (arXiv:2207.07182 [hep-th]). However, the result is the strong coupling limit or the large-$N_c$ limit. A natural question is how the dual GL theory changes at finite coupling. We identify the dual GL theory for a minimal holographic superconductor at finite coupling (Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor), where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly. The GL parameter $\kappa$ increases at finite coupling, namely the system approaches a more Type-II superconductor like material. We also point out two potential problems in previous works: (1) the "naive" AdS/CFT dictionary, and (2) the condensate determined only from the GL potential terms. As a result, the condensate increases at finite coupling unlike common folklore.</description>

      <title>The Polarised IKKT Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between a supersymmetric mass deformation of the IKKT matrix integral at large $N$ and a background of Euclidean type IIB string theory. Both sides have sixteen supersymmetries and an $SO(3)\times SO(7)$ symmetry. In the limit of large mass the integral is dominated by a fuzzy sphere saddle point. This saddle corresponds to a Euclidean $D1$-brane in a finite, Euclidean, ellipsoidal cavity. The cavity is supported by three-form NSNS flux that polarises $N$ $D$-instantons into the $D1$-brane. We furthermore use supersymmetric localisation to show that the deformed matrix integral can be reduced to a moduli space integral, allowing exact results away from the large mass limit. At small mass the $D1$-branes can backreact on the geometry, and we discuss the possible formulation of a `timeless' holography in such regimes.</description>

      <title>${T\overline{T}}$-like Flows of Yang-Mills Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ${T\overline{T}}$-like deformations of $d&gt;2$ Yang-Mills theories. The standard ${T\overline{T}}$ flows lead to multi-trace Lagrangians, and the non-Abelian gauge structures make it challenging to find Lagrangians in a closed form. However, within the geometric approach to ${T\overline{T}}$, we obtain the closed-form solution to the metric flow and stress-energy tensor, and show that instanton solutions are undeformed. We also introduce new symmetrised single-trace ${T\overline{T}}$-like deformations, whose solutions in $d=4$ include the non-Abelian Born-Infeld Lagrangian proposed by Tseytlin in 1997.</description>

      <title>The complex Liouville string: the worldsheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new two-dimensional string theory defined by coupling two copies of Liouville CFT with complex central charge $c=13\pm i \lambda$ on the worldsheet. This string theory defines a novel, consistent and controllable model of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We use the exact solution of the worldsheet theory to derive stringent constraints on the analytic structure of the string amplitudes as a function of the vertex operator momenta. Together with other worldsheet constraints, this allows us to completely pin down the string amplitudes without explicitly computing the moduli space integrals. We focus on the case of the sphere four-point amplitude and torus one-point amplitude as worked examples. This is the first in a series of papers on the complex Liouville string: three subsequent papers will elucidate the holographic duality with a two-matrix integral, discuss worldsheet boundaries and non-perturbative effects, and connect the theory to de Sitter quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in the Carrollian regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

      <title>Consistent Canonical Quantization of Gravity: Recovery of Classical GR from BRST-invariant Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of General Relativity, as an effective quantum field theory below the Planck scale, within the BRST-invariant framework. We show that the promotion of constraints to dynamical equations of motion for auxiliary fields leads to the healthy Hamiltonian flow. In particular, we show that the classical properties of Einstein's gravity, such as vanishing Hamiltonian modulo boundary contribution, is realized merely as an expectation value in appropriate physical states. Most importantly, the physicality is shown not to entail trivial time-evolution for correlation functions. In the present approach we quantize the theory once and for all around the Minkowaski vacuum and treat other would-be classical backgrounds as BRST-invariant coherent states. This is especially important for cosmological spacetimes as it uncovers features that are not visible in ordinary semi-classical treatment. The Poincar\'e invariance of the vacuum, essential for our quantization, provides strong motivation for spontaneously-broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Spinor-Vector Duality and Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry was first observed in worldsheet string constructions and shown to have profound implications in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) limit of string compactifications, and for the properties of Calabi-Yau manifolds. It opened up a new field in pure mathematics and was utilised in the area of enumerative geometry. Spinor-Vector Duality (SVD) is an extension of mirror symmetry. This can be readily understood in terms of the moduli of toroidal compactification of the heterotic string, which include the metric the antisymmetric tensor field and the Wilson line moduli. In terms of toroidal moduli, mirror symmetry corresponds to mappings of the internal space moduli, whereas spinor-vector duality corresponds to maps of the Wilson line moduli. In the past few of years, we demonstrated the existence of spinor-vector duality in the effective field theory compactifications of the string theories. This was achieved by starting with a worldsheet orbifold construction that exhibited spinor-vector duality and resolving the orbifold singularities, hence generating a smooth effective field theory limit with an imprint of the spinor-vector duality. Just like mirror symmetry, the spinor-vector duality can be used to study the properties of complex manifolds with vector bundles. Spinor--vector duality offers a top-down approach to the ``Swampland''-program, by exploring the imprint of the symmetries of the ultra-violet complete worldsheet string constructions in the effective field theory limit. The SVD suggests a demarcation line between (2,0) EFTs that possess an ultra-violet complete embedding versus those that do not.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of dRGT ghost-free massive gravity in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on dRGT massive gravity in spherical symmetry in the limit of small graviton mass. Firstly we examine the minimal model. This does not exhibit a Vainshtein mechanism in spherical symmetry, but one may still ask what happens for spherical dynamics. We show that there are no regular time-dependent spherically symmetric solutions unless the matter has sufficiently large pressure. For matter that does not satisfy this, such as non-relativistic matter, any Cauchy slice of such a solution must necessarily have a point where the metric becomes singular. Only a weak assumption on the asymptotics is made. We then consider the next-to-minimal model. This has been argued to have a good Vainshtein mechanism in spherical symmetry, and hence be phenomenologically viable, provided the relative sign of the minimal and next-to-minimal mass terms is the same, and we restrict attention to this case. We find that regular behaviour requires the matter at the origin of symmetry to have positive pressure -- in particular a massive scalar field fails to satisfy this condition. Furthermore it restricts non-relativistic matter so that the pressure is bounded from below in terms of the density and graviton mass in a manner that is at odds with a reasonable phenomenology. This suggests that realistic phenomenology will either require a resolution of singularities, or will require dynamics beyond the non-generic setting of spherical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps for supersymmetric sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric field theories can be characterized by their Nicolai map, which is a nonlinear and nonlocal field transformation to their free-field limit. The systematic construction of such maps has recently been outlined for actions with power more than two in the fermions, which produces a perturbative expansion in loop-decorated fermionic tree diagrams. We thoroughly investigate the nonlinear $\mathbb C P^1$ sigma model in ($3{+}1$)-dimensional Minkowski space as a paradigmatical example. We construct and test a chiral form of the Nicolai map, to third order in the coupling, including all (regularized) quantum parts. In addition, all trees with one or two edges are summed up. The free-action condition determines only the one-edge part of the map. We resolve the fermion loop decoration of the Nicolai trees by injecting an auxiliary vector field and present the ensuing classical Nicolai map to second order in a dimensionful coupling.</description>

      <title>Gauge-fixing local H symmetry in supergravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss known maximal D-dimensional supergravities of two types: type I with G/H coset spaces and type II derived by compactification from higher dimensions without dualization, these have less manifest symmetries. In 4D and 6D in type I models we perform explicit gauge-fixing of local H symmetries in unitary gauges: symmetric, Iwasawa, and partial Iwasawa. In 4D supergravity I in symmetric gauge global H-invariance and nonlinearly realized G-symmetry are valid on shell, classically. The global H-symmetry and G-symmetry in Iwasawa-type gauges in type I and type II supergravities are not manifest, if at all present. This fact raises the issue of the gauge equivalence of the S-matrix of various gauge-fixed D-dimensional supergravities and its relation to the ones computable using superamplitude methods.</description>

      <title>Comparing Analytic and Numerical Studies of Tensor Perturbations in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of different quantization approaches in Loop Quantum Cosmology for the primordial power spectrum of tensor modes. Specifically, we consider the hybrid and dressed metric approaches to derive the effective mass that governs the evolution of the tensor modes. Our study comprehensively examines the two resulting effective masses and how to estimate them in order to obtain approximated analytic solutions to the tensor perturbation equations. Since Loop Quantum Cosmology incorporates preinflationary effects in the dynamics of the perturbations, we do not have at our disposal a standard choice of privileged vacuum, like the Bunch--Davies state in quasi-de Sitter inflation. We then select the vacuum state by a recently proposed criterion which removes unwanted oscillations in the power spectrum and guarantees an asymptotic diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the ultraviolet. This vacuum is usually called the NO-AHD (from the initials of Non-Oscillating with Asymptotic Hamiltonian Diagonalization) vacuum. Consequently, we compute the power spectrum by using our analytic approximations and by introducing a suitable numerical procedure, adopting in both cases an NO-AHD vacuum. With this information, we compare the different spectra obtained from the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches, as well as from the analytic and numerical procedures. In particular, this proves the remarkable accuracy of our~approximations.</description>

      <title>First Principle Predictions for Cold Fermionic Gases Near Criticality via Critical Boson Dominance and Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the authors have developed an effective field theory formalism to systematically describe cold fermionic gases near the unitary limit. The theory has enhanced predictive power due to the fact that interactions are dominated by the exchange of a gapped critical boson whose couplings and mass are fixed by matching the dilatation anomaly between the UV and IR theories. We utilize this theory to give analytic predictions for the compressibility and magnetic susceptibility for fermions near unitarity with attractive interactions above the critical temperature $T_c$, with a well defined theoretical error. The inputs to the predictions are: the scattering length $a$, the effective mass $m^\star$ and contact parameter $\tilde C(a)$. We then compare our predictions to numerical simulations and find excellent agreement within the window of scattering lengths where the EFT is valid ($10\geq \mid \! k_F a \! \mid\geq 1$). Experimental corroboration of this theory supports critical point that can be describe by the inclusion of a scalar dilaton mode, whose action is fixed by symmetries.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantization generates all multiple zeta values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Banks--Panzer--Pym have shown that the volume integrals appearing in Kontsevich's deformation quantization formula always evaluate to integer-linear combinations of multiple zeta values (MZVs). We prove a sort of converse, which they conjectured in their work, namely that with the logarithmic propagator: (1) the coefficients associated to the graphs appearing at order $\hbar^n$ in the quantization formula generate the Q-vector space of weight-$n$ MZVs, and (2) the set of all coefficients generates the Z-module of MZVs. In order to prove this result, we develop a new technique for integrating Kontsevich graphs using polylogarithms and apply it to an infinite subset of Kontsevich graphs. Then, using the binary string representation of MZVs and the Lyndon word decomposition of binary strings, we show that this subset of graphs generates all MZVs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function clarifies the importance of orbital angular momentum to bulk thermodynamics in addition to the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. In particular, we make an experimentally testable prediction that the orbital contribution should preponderate over the spin contribution, and thus flip the sign of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.</description>

      <title>Distance-dependent interaction between cosmic strings inspired by higher-dimensional gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) strings with the one-loop effective potentials induced by higher-dimensional gauge theory. As our starting point, we consider a five-dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory with an extra-dimensional space $S^1/Z_2$. We numerically show the properties of the strings in our model. Especially, we investigate the interaction force between two parallel strings. We find that the interaction force switches from attraction to repulsion as two strings approach each other at a certain parameter region. This interaction is not observed for the ANO strings with the Mexican hat potential. Furthermore, we find that each different factor determines the interaction between large and small interstring distances. We interpret this difference as the origin of the distance-dependent interaction. Our interpretation can also be applied to other scalar potentials. The results in our study give us a new perspective to understand the interaction between the ANO strings with various scalar potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equal-time commutators of different components of the energy-momentum tensor at spatially separated points are calculated for a relativistic quantum Fermi gas at finite temperature and density. Different definitions of such components, also known as different pseudogauges, are used and smeared with a Gaussian profile characterized by the width $\sigma$. In this way, we introduce observables that may represent measurements of energy and momentum in a spatial region of size $\sigma$. We find that the obtained commutators are sensitive to the pseudogauge chosen if the probed systems or the spatial separation are small. The pseudogauge dependence is expected as different quantum operators are analyzed in this case. On the other hand, we find that for sufficiently large probed systems or with large separation, the studied commutators are pseudogauge independent.</description>

Abstract: We study axion-photon couplings in compactifications of type IIB string theory. We find that these couplings are systematically suppressed compared to the inverse axion periodicity, as a result of two effects. First, couplings to the QED theta angle are suppressed for axion mass eigenstates that are light compared to the mass scale set by stringy instantons on the cycle supporting QED. Second, in compactifications with many axions the intersection matrix is sparse, making kinetic mixing weak. We study the resulting phenomenology in an ensemble of $200{,}000$ toy models constructed from the Kreuzer-Skarke database up to the maximum Hodge number $h^{1,1}=491$. We examine freeze-in production and decay of thermal axions, birefringence of the cosmic microwave background, X-ray spectrum oscillations, and constraints on the QCD axion from supernovae. We conclude that compactifications in this corner of the landscape involve many invisible axions, as well as a handful that may be detectable via photon couplings.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries: (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03784v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to characterize gapped infra-red (IR) phases of theories with non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries. In this paper we focus on (1+1)d gapped phases with fusion category symmetries. The approach that we propose uses the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) as a key input: associated to a field theory in d spacetime dimensions, the SymTFT lives in one dimension higher and admits a gapped boundary, which realizes the categorical symmetries. It also admits a second, physical, boundary, which is generically not gapped. Upon interval compactification of the SymTFT by colliding the gapped and physical boundaries, we regain the original theory. In this paper, we realize gapped symmetric phases by choosing the physical boundary to be a gapped boundary condition as well. This set-up provides computational power to determine the number of vacua, the symmetry breaking pattern, and the action of the symmetry on the vacua. The SymTFT also manifestly encodes the order parameters for these gapped phases, thus providing a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm for (1+1)d gapped phases. We find that for non-invertible symmetries the order parameters involve multiplets containing both untwisted and twisted sector local operators, and hence can be interpreted as mixtures of conventional and string order parameters. We also observe that spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to vacua that are physically distinguishable: unlike the standard symmetries described by groups, non-invertible symmetries can have different actions on different vacua of an irreducible gapped phase. This leads to the presence of relative Euler terms between physically distinct vacua. We also provide a mathematical description of symmetric gapped phases as 2-functors from delooping of fusion category characterizing the symmetry to Euler completion of 2-vector spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the beta deformation of the superstring in $AdS_5\times S^5$ at all orders in the deformation parameter, using the pure spinor formalism. This is necessary to study the regime of strong deformation parameter, which in the field side is related to fishnet theories. We compare the pure spinor sigma model approach to the previously known supergravity description. We find a complete agreement. Moreover, the BRST structure of the worldsheet model provides a natural explanation of the peculiar features of the worldsheet model in the fishnet limit. In particular, we study the degeneracy of the sigma model Lagrangian. We show that the BRST structure is responsible for a particularly "tame" degeneration of the fishnet sigma-model.</description>

Abstract: Junction conditions play a crucial role in constructing new gravity solutions. In this paper, we derive the junction condition for gluing together an arbitrary number of spacetimes along a common interface. We develop a geometric technique of reverse extension and provide precise definitions of geometric quantities at the interface. This leads to a geometric derivation of the multiway junction condition. As a cross-check, we independently re-derive the junction condition by varying the action of some specific gravitational models including both Einstein gravity and dilaton gravity. We demonstrate that the junction condition is invariant under a change of frames, and the form of the junction condition is the same for both spacelike and timelike interfaces.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of RG flow in emergent dual holography of worldsheet nonlinear $\sigma$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09122v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the renormalization group (RG) flow of worldsheet bosonic string theory, we construct an effective holographic dual description of the target space theory identifying the RG scale with the emergent extra dimension. This results in an effective dilaton-gravity theory, analogous to the low-energy description of bosonic M-theory. We argue that this holographic dual effective field theory is non-perturbative in the $\alpha'$ expansion, where a class of string quantum fluctuations are resummed in all orders. To investigate the monotonicity of RG flow of the target space metric in the emergent spacetime, we consider entropy production along the RG flow. We construct a microscopic entropy functional based on the probability distribution function of the holographic dual effective field theory, regarded as Gibbs- or Shannon-type entropy. Given that the Ricci flow represents the 1-loop RG flow equation of the target space metric for the 2D non-linear sigma model, and motivated by Perelman's proof of the monotonicity of Ricci flow, we propose a Perelman's entropy functional for the holographic dual effective field theory. This entropy functional is also non-perturbative in the $\alpha'$ expansion, and thus, generalizes the 1-loop result into the all-loop order. Furthermore, utilizing the equivalence between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the local RG equation, we suggest that the RG flow of holographic Perelman's entropy functional is the Weyl anomaly. This eventually reaffirms the monotonicity of RG flow for the emergent target spacetime but in a non-perturbative way. Interestingly, we find that the microscopic entropy production rate can be determined by integrating the rate of change of the holographic Perelman's entropy functional over all possible metric configurations along the flow.</description>

Abstract: We construct 4D flat Big Bang-Big Crunch cosmologies and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) planar eternally traversable wormholes using braneworlds embedded in asymptotically AdS${}_5$ spacetimes. The background geometries are the AdS${}_5$ magnetic black brane and the magnetically charged AdS${}_5$ soliton, respectively. The two setups arise from different analytic continuations of the same saddle of the gravitational Euclidean path integral, in which the braneworld takes the form of a Maldacena-Maoz Euclidean wormhole. We show the existence of a holographic dual description of this setup in terms of a microscopic Euclidean boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) on a strip. By analyzing the BCFT Euclidean path integral, we show that the braneworld cosmology is encoded in a pure excited state of a CFT dual to a black brane microstate, whereas the braneworld wormhole is encoded in the ground state of the BCFT. The latter confines in the IR, and we study its confining properties using holography. We also comment on the properties of bulk reconstruction in the two Lorentzian pictures and their relationship via double analytic continuation. This work can be interpreted as an explicit, doubly-holographic realization of the relationship between cosmology, traversable wormholes, and confinement in holography, first proposed in arXiv:2102.05057, arXiv:2203.11220.</description>

Abstract: For the class of $1+1$ dimensional field theories referred to as the non-linear sigma models, there is known to be a deep connection between classical integrability and one-loop renormalizability. In this work, the phenomenon is reviewed on the example of the so-called fully anisotropic ${\rm SU}(2)$ Principal Chiral Field (PCF). Along the way, we discover a new classically integrable four parameter family of sigma models, which is obtained from the fully anisotropic ${\rm SU}(2)$ PCF by means of the Poisson-Lie deformation. The theory turns out to be one-loop renormalizable and the system of ODEs describing the flow of the four couplings is derived. Also provided are explicit analytical expressions for the full set of functionally independent first integrals (renormalization group invariants).</description>

Abstract: Ghosts have been a stumbling block in the development of a UV complete quantum field theory for gravity. We discuss how difficulties associated with ghosts are overcome in the context of 0+1d QFT. Obtaining a probability interpretation is the key issue, and for this we discuss how an appropriate inner product can be constructed to define a sensible Born rule. Ghost theories are intrinsically unitary and perturbatively stable. They can also display nonperburbative stability even when the corresponding normal theory does not. The spectra and propagators are numerically obtained at both weak and strong coupling. Normalizable wave functions are obtained for the energy eigenstates and they show a violation of normal parity. We discuss connections to PT-symmetric quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite dimensional Lie algebras, whose infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras correspond with the symmetry algebra of $2d$ integrable models. These Lie algebras are defined by the set of infinitesimal, nonlinear, and higher derivative symmetry transformations present in theories with a left(right)-moving or (anti)-holomorphic current. We study a large class of such Lagrangian theories. We classify the commuting subalgebras of the $2d$ free massless scalar, and find the symmetries of the known integrable models such as sine-Gordon, Liouville, Bullough-Dodd, and Korteweg-de Vries. Along the way, we find several new sequences of commuting charges, which we conjecture are charges of integrable models which are new deformations of a single scalar. After quantizing, the Lie algebra is deformed, and so are their commuting subalgebras.</description>

      <title>On the classical limit of the (sub)$^{n}$-leading soft graviton theorems in $D = 4$ without deflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree-level gravitational amplitudes satisfy an infinite hierarchy of soft factorization theorems. The existence of these theorems has been recently linked with the existence of an infinite tower of asymptotic symmetries. In this paper, we analyze the relevance of the soft graviton theorems beyond sub-leading order in the context of classical gravitational scattering in four dimensions. More in detail, we show that the infinite impact parameter limit of the late-time gravitational field emitted during a classical scattering can be derived using these factorization theorems. The classical field obtained in this (infinite impact parameter) regime has an expansion in the frequency of the detector where the modes scale as $\omega^{n}\log{\omega}$ with a vanishing memory.</description>

      <title>Reductions of GKZ Systems and Applications to Cosmological Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful approach to computing Feynman integrals or cosmological correlators is to consider them as solution to systems of differential equations. Often these can be chosen to be Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) systems. However, their naive construction introduces a significant amount of unnecessary complexity. In this paper we present an algorithm which allows for reducing these GKZ systems to smaller subsystems if a parameter associated to the GKZ systems is resonant. These simpler subsystems can then be solved separately resulting in solutions for the full system. The algorithm makes it possible to check when reductions happen and allows for finding the associated simpler solutions. While originating in the mathematical theory of D-modules analyzed via exact sequences of Euler-Koszul homologies, the algorithm can be used without knowledge of this framework. We motivate the need for such reduction techniques by considering cosmological correlators on an FRW space-time and solve the tree-level single-exchange correlator in this way. It turns out that this integral exemplifies an interesting relation between locality and the reduction of the differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent astrophysical observations, we investigate the shadow behaviors of four dimensional charged rotating black holes with a cosmological constant. This study is made in terms of a reduced moduli space parameterized by the charge and the rotation parameters. For fixed observers, we analyse in some details the shadow behaviors and the corresponding naked singularities of Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen four-dimensional black holes in Anti de Sitter backgrounds. Then, a comparative discussion is provided by computing the geometrical observables and the energy emission rate.</description>

      <title>Analytic Primordial Power Spectrum in the Dressed Metric Approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology and Thermodynamics of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the primordial power spectrum of cosmological tensor perturbations in the dressed metric approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology. We compute the background-dependent effective mass that affects their propagation using the effective description of Loop Quantum Cosmology and show that this mass can be approximated in different cosmological epochs by appropriate analytic functions. Moreover, in each of those epochs we can analytically solve the propagation of the perturbations, then obtaining the general solution globally by continuity requirements. On the other hand, since there are regimes far away from slow roll in the considered background evolution, the Bunch-Davies state does not provide a privileged choice of vacuum that would pick out a specific solution for the perturbations. Instead, we select the state of these perturbations by a recently proposed criterion that removes unwanted oscillations in the power spectrum. We compute the spectrum of this vacuum and compare it with other spectra obtained in the literature, especially with one corresponding to the hybrid approach to Loop Quantum Cosmology. Finally, we notice that the same type of background dynamics is found in a phenomenological approach to quantum gravity based on thermodynamics, allowing in this case a free value for the tantamount of the critical density. Extending the dressed metric proposal to this phenomenological model, one might expect a similar form for the associated primordial power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the proposal of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, error and disturbance of quantum measurements have been fundamental notions in quantum physics. As is often the case when defining physical quantities in quantum physics, there is no single way to define these two notions, and many independent definitions of them have been given. Here, we establish a novel formulation defining the error and disturbance as special cases of the irreversibility in quantum processes. The formulation enables us to apply the knowledge of irreversibility in stochastic thermodynamics and quantum information theory to the error and disturbance in quantum measurements. To demonstrate this strength, we provide three byproducts: First, we unify the existing formulations of error and disturbance. Second, we extend the quantitative Wigner--Araki--Yanase theorem -- a universal restriction on measurement implementation under a conservation law -- to errors and disturbances of arbitrary definitions and processes. Third, we reveal that our formulation covers the out-of-time-orderd-correlator -- a measure of quantum chaos in a quantum many-body system -- as the irreversibility in analogy with the measurement context, and provide its experimental evaluation method.</description>

      <title>Classification of symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to classify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. This framework can deal with all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or non-Abelian, chiral or non-chiral. It can systematically treat a general symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may contain anti-unitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to all types of lattices, and can systematically distinguish different lattice systems with the same symmetry group using their Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies. We apply this framework to classify $U(1)_{2N}$ chiral states and non-Abelian Ising$^{(\nu)}$ states enriched by a $p6\times SO(3)$ or $p4\times SO(3)$ symmetry, and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological orders and $U(1)_{2N}\times U(1)_{-2N}$ topological orders enriched by a $p6m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p4m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p6m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ or $p4m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $p6$, $p4$, $p6m$ and $p4m$ are lattice symmetries, while $SO(3)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ are spin rotation and time reversal symmetries, respectively. In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including examples with the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the time evolution of quantum entanglement in presence of non-collapsing interactions. In particular, the entanglement between the products of a muon decay in a magnetic field is revisited. It results from angular momentum conservation and leads to an anomaly in the measured muon g factor in precise agreement with that reported by the Brookhaven and Fermilab experiments.</description>

      <title>On rips and cosmological singularities in a universe merging with baby universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the late-time acceleration of the universe and its subtleties is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology. A lot of different approaches have been put forward to deal with this, ranging from the conventional cosmological constant to various models of dark energy and beyond. Recently one very interesting approach to explaining the late time acceleration has been put forward, where the the expansion of the universe is driven by mergers with other "baby" universes and has been shown to be quite viable as well from the point of view of recent observational data. So in this work we examine the possibility of various rip scenarios and other future cosmological singularities in such "multiversal" scenario, probing such singularities for the first time in a multi universe scenario. We examine two models of such a baby universe merging cosmology, and show that remarkably no rip scenario or future cosmological singularity is possible in such models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Abelian Higgs model with multiple scalar fields, but without mass terms. Solving the model non-perturbatively order-by-order in the number of scalar fields, we find that radiative corrections generate masses for the scalar and gauge boson, without spontaneous symmetry breaking. The mass scales are set by the $\Lambda$-parameter of the electroweak running coupling, thereby naturally avoiding the hierarchy problem. No part of our calculation employs a weak-coupling expansion, and we find that the perturbative vacuum is metastable, and hence must decay to the stable non-perturbative vacuum of the theory, which we identify. Although the field content of our Lagrangian is standard, our results predict the existence of two heavy scalar resonances in addition to the Higgs. We believe that these predicted resonances will ultimately allow experimentalists to discriminate between our method and standard solutions of the Higgs model.</description>

      <title>Dark energy with a shift-symmetric scalar field: obstacles, loophole hunting and dead ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a scalar field being the fundamental description of dark energy. We focus on shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories since this symmetry potentially avoids some fine-tuning problems. We also restrict attention to theories satisfying that the propagation speed of gravitational waves is equal to the speed of light. These considerations lead us to investigate shift-symmetric Kinetic Gravity Braiding theories. Analysing the stability of scalar linear perturbations, we discuss the conditions that seems to be necessary to describe (super) accelerated cosmic expansion without introducing instabilities. However, it has been previously established that the linearised analysis does not guarantee the stability of this non-canonical scalar theory, as potentially dangerous interactions between dark energy fluctuations and tensor perturbations (essentially gravitational waves) appear at a higher order in perturbation theory. Indeed, although we shall point out that the standard proof of absence of dark energy stable braiding models due to this interaction has a possible way-out, we find general arguments suggesting that there are no dark energy stable solutions that can exploit this loophole. Thus, we discuss future research directions for finding viable fundamental descriptions of dark energy. We also provide a dictionary between the covariant version of the scalar field theory and that of the Effective Field Theory approach, explicitly computing the parameters in the latter formalism in terms of the functions appearing in the covariant version, and its derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these expressions are explicitly obtained up-to arbitrary order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Laplace transform that maps the topological recursion (TR) wavefunction to its $x$-$y$ swap dual is defined. This transform is then applied to the construction of quantum curves. General results are obtained, including a formula for the quantisation of many spectral curves of the form $e^xP_2(e^y) - P_1(e^y) = 0$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are coprime polynomials; an important class that contains interesting spectral curves related to mirror symmetry and knot theory that have, heretofore, evaded the general TR-based methods previously used to derive quantum curves. Quantum curves known in the literature are reproduced, and new quantum curves are derived. In particular, the quantum curve for the $T$-equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathbb{P}(a,b)$ is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the plethora of nonextensive and/or nonadditive entropies which go beyond the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs formulation. After defining the basic notions of additivity, extensivity, and composability, we discuss the properties of these entropies and their mutual relations, if they exist. The results are presented in two informative tables supposedly of strong interest to gravity and cosmology community in the context of intensively explored recent days the horizon entropies for black hole and cosmological models. This is since gravitational systems admit long-range interactions which usually lead to a break of the standard additivity rule for thermodynamical systems composed of subsystems in Boltzmann-Gibbs thermodynamics. The features of additivity, extensivity, and the composability are listed systematically. Some brief discussion on the validity of the notion of equilibrium temperature for nonextensive systems is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that some holographic dark energy models can lead to a future evolution of the universe in which the scale factor $a$ is asymptotically constant, while $\dot a \rightarrow 0$ and the corresponding energy and pressure densities also vanish. We provide specific examples of such models and general conditions that can lead to an asymptotically static universe, which we have called the ``long freeze." We show that in some cases, such evolution can follow an arbitrarily long exponential expansion essentially identical to the asymptotic evolution of $\Lambda$CDM.</description>
