      <title>From Columns to Heaps: Dimensionless Similarity with PSD-Distributed Damk\"ohler Numbers and Dual-Porosity Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a unified, dimensionless framework for comparing geometrically similar reacting porous-flow systems across scale, with emphasis on hydrometallurgical heap leaching, when particle size distribution (PSD) and intraparticle pore structure differ. Under dynamic similarity, the dimensionless liquid residence-time distribution (RTD) is identical, but differences in PSD and internal porosity break microscopic similarity. Using the shrinking-core model (SCM), the analysis shows how a PSD in particle diameter maps to a distribution of particle-scale Damk\"ohler numbers that governs heap-averaged conversion.
  Explicit PSD to Damk\"ohler transformations are derived for (i) external film control, (ii) intraparticle diffusion control, and (iii) mixed control via additive rates. Dual-porosity hydrology relevant to sedimentary or strongly stratified ores is then incorporated by coupling SCM kinetics to mobile and immobile liquid domains, introducing additional dimensionless groups that describe interporosity exchange. Two numerical examples map a lognormal PSD into film- and diffusion-controlled Damk\"ohler distributions and compare column/heap conversion for different PSDs. A practical workflow is outlined for hydrometallurgical column-test interpretation, combining tracer RTD calibration with PSD-aware kinetic fitting in dimensionless time. The framework clarifies why diffusion-controlled leaching is far more sensitive to PSD tails and dual-porosity structure than film-controlled leaching, and it identifies the compact set of dimensionless groups that must be matched to ensure similarity between laboratory columns and industrial heaps.</description>

      <title>Model-Driven Conditional Fourier Neural Operator for Spectrum-Consistent Synthetic Turbulence Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note proposes a model-driven conditional Fourier neural operator (MD-CFNO) for synthetic turbulence generation. Spectrum-consistent synthetic turbulence is essential for inflow boundary construction in computational fluid dynamics and for broadband aeroacoustic noise prediction. Data-driven turbulence synthesis with neural networks has emerged as a promising direction. However, generating flow fields that match prescribed energy spectra across wide physical regimes remains challenging. Existing data-driven methods typically rely on expensive reliable datasets with limited generalization and are prone to regression-to-the-mean when trained in the spatial domain. To address these issues, the MD-CFNO is proposed with three components: a model-driven data construction strategy is adopted to improve interpretability and broaden the generalizable parameter regime; conditional stochastic generation is integrated into the Fourier neural operator architecture to alleviate regression-to-the-mean effects; and a composite loss is introduced to accelerate convergence and enhance spectral fidelity. Results show that the proposed MD-CFNO generates spectrum-consistent synthetic turbulence and achieves robust performance under both interpolation and out-of-distribution extrapolation conditions. This study provides a model-driven perspective on synthetic turbulence, showing the advantages of Fourier neural operators for conditional generation.</description>

      <title>On the testing of grain shape corrections to bedload transport equations with grain-resolved numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using grain-resolved LES-DEM simulations, Zhang et al. (J. Geophys. Res. Earth Surf. 130, e2024JF007937, 2025) aimed to validate a grain-shape-corrected bedload transport equation proposed earlier by the same group. It states that grain shape effects are captured through a modified Shields number that depends, among others, on the drag coefficient, $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$, determined from the force balance for a grain settling in a fluid at rest. To independently vary $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ in their simulations, the authors changed the boundary conditions on the grains' surfaces: By artificially shifting the locations of the no-slip conditions from the actual grain surface to a virtual surface a distance $l$ into the grain interior, they hoped to well approximate Navier-slip conditions with a slip length $l$. Here, we argue that this approximation is appropriate only if the thickness of the boundary layer that forms around the virtual surface is much larger than $l$, which we demonstrate was not the case for the authors' simulations. In particular, using independent DNS-DEM grain settling simulations for the same hydrodynamic conditions, we directly show that this approximation substantially overestimates the value of $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ of a Navier-slip sphere. This implies that the conditions created with their artificial method do not correspond to physically realistic scenarios and therefore do not support the authors' grain shape correction. To support this conclusion, we demonstrate that their entire numerical data can be alternatively explained by a simple null hypothesis model, without grain shape correction, based on the virtual-grain rather than the actual-grain size.</description>

      <title>Maximal spreading of impacting viscoelastic droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet impact and spreading on solid substrates are well understood for Newtonian fluids, yet how viscoelasticity alone modifies the maximal spreading remains unclear. To discern the physical mechanisms governing the spreading dynamics, we present a simplified theoretical model, validated by impact experiments, to quantify how fluid elasticity modifies the maximal spreading of impacting droplets. Experiments were performed using fluids within a narrow range of viscosity and surface tension, but varying relaxation time. While following similar asymptotic scalings as Newtonian droplets, the maximum diameter for viscoelastic droplets exhibits a clear deviation from Newtonian behaviour only when the Deborah number is of order unity. The maximum spread diameter is reduced by as much as 40% from the expected value for Newtonian fluid. These results support the central prediction of our model: an extension of classical energy balance that incorporates viscoelastic effects through a single correction factor. The model captures the observed reduction in maximal spreading and predicts both the location and magnitude of the most substantial viscoelastic effects, providing a basis for extending impact models beyond purely Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Radially Varying Diffusivities on Stellar Convection Zone Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convection is ubiquitous in stellar and planetary interiors where it likely plays an integral role in the generation of magnetic fields. As the interiors of these objects remain hidden from direct observation, numerical models of convection are an important tool in the study of astrophysical dynamos. In such models, unrealistic large values of the viscous ($\nu$) and thermal ($\kappa$) diffusivity are routinely used as an ad-hoc representation of the effects of subgrid scale turbulence which is otherwise too small-scale to resolve numerically. However, the functional forms of these diffusion coefficients can vary greatly between studies, complicating efforts to compare between results and against observations. We explore this issue by considering a series of non-rotating, non-magnetic, solar-like convection models with varying radial functions for the diffusivities and differing boundary conditions. We find that the bulk kinetic energy scales similarly regardless of the diffusivity parameterization. This scaling is consistent with a free-fall scaling, wherein viscosity plays a subdominant role in the force balance. We do not, however, observe such diffusion-free behavior in the convective heat transport. Our results also indicate that the functional form adopted for the diffusion coefficients can impact the distribution of turbulence within the convective shell. These results suggest that some care should be taken when comparing solar convection models directly against helioseismic observations.</description>

      <title>Couette Taylor instabilities in the small-gap regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Couette-Taylor instability occurs in a viscous fluid confined between two coaxial rotating cylinders. When the Taylor number surpasses a critical value, the stable Couette flow destabilizes, giving way to steady Taylor vortices. As the Taylor number increases further, these vortices themselves become unstable, transitioning into wavy Taylor vortices.
  In this article, we focus on the small-gap limit, where the ratio of the cylinder radii approaches unity and the rotation rates of the cylinders are nearly identical. We provide a rigorous proof of the existence of a critical Taylor number $T_c$, at which the Couette flow loses stability.
  For Taylor numbers just above $T_c$, under fixed axial periodicity, the solutions to the limiting Navier-Stokes system are governed by a Ginzburg-Landau-type partial differential equation. Beyond the classical Taylor vortex flow, we demonstrate that a two-parameter family of solutions emerges at criticality for $T&gt;T_c$. This family includes not only wavy vortices but also a variety of other exotic flow patterns, all of which remain steady in the frame rotating at the average angular velocity of the cylinders.</description>

      <title>Coupled gas and bubble dynamics at the solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and entrapment of gas bubbles during solidification significantly influence the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials, from metallic alloys to ice. While gas segregation at the solidification front is well-documented, the real-time dynamics of bubble nucleation, growth, and engulfment-and their dependence on solidification velocity-remain poorly understood. In this study, we use in situ cryo-confocal fluorescence microscopy to investigate the coupled gas-bubble dynamics at the solidification front of carbonated water, systematically varying the solidification velocity ($V = 1-20 \mu m/s$) while maintaining a constant thermal gradient ($G = 15 K/mm$). Our experiments reveal that bubble nucleation is governed by a characteristic nucleation time, which emerges from the interplay between gas diffusion ahead of the front, nucleation kinetics, and bubble growth, all competing with the advancing solidification front. These results allow us to estimate the critical gas concentration for bubbles nucleation in carbonated water. These results offer a detailed understanding of the mechanisms controlling bubble nucleation and entrapment during solidification at constant thermal gradient. They contribute to the development of strategies to control bubble formation in industrial processes where the presence of bubbles can either be detrimental or intentionally harnessed.</description>

      <title>Meshless Super-Resolution of Scattered Data via constrained RBFs and KNN-Driven Densification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel meshless method to achieve super resolution from scattered data obtained from sparse, randomly positioned sensors such as the particle tracers of particle tracking velocimetry. The method combines K Nearest Neighbor Particle Tracking Velocimetry (KNN PTV, Tirelli et al. 2023) with meshless Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (meshless POD, Tirelli et al. 2025) and constrained Radial Basis Function regression (c RBFs, Sperotto et al. 2022). The main idea is to enhance the spatial resolution of flow fields by blending data from locally similar flow regions available in the time series. This similarity is assessed in terms of statistical coherency with leading features identified by meshless POD applied directly to scattered data, without interpolation onto a grid and relying instead on RBFs to compute the relevant inner products. The denser scattered distributions are then used within a constrained RBF framework to derive an analytical representation of the flow fields that incorporates physical constraints. The approach is fully meshless and does not require a grid at any stage, offering flexibility in complex geometries. An ablation study highlights the role of penalties and physical constraints in regularizing the regression and ensuring physically consistent reconstructions. The method is validated using three dimensional measurements of a jet flow in air. The assessment focuses on statistics, spectra, and modal analysis. Performance is evaluated against standard Particle Image Velocimetry, KNN PTV, and c RBFs. The results show improved accuracy, with an average error of about ten percent compared to twelve to thirteen percent for the other methods, nearly halved errors in reduced order reconstructions, and a higher frequency cutoff based on the noise floor.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear projection-based model order reduction with machine learning regression for closure error modeling in the latent space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant advancement in nonlinear projection-based model order reduction (PMOR) is presented through a highly effective methodology. This methodology employs Gaussian process regression (GPR) and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for closure error modeling in the latent space, offering notable gains in efficiency and expanding the scope of PMOR. Moving beyond the limitations of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), previously used for this task, this approach provides crucial advantages in terms of interpretability and a reduced demand for extensive training data. The capabilities of GPR and RBFs are showcased in two demanding applications: a two-dimensional parametric inviscid Burgers problem, featuring propagating shocks across the entire computational domain, and a complex three-dimensional turbulent flow simulation around an Ahmed body. The results demonstrate that this innovative approach preserves accuracy and achieves substantial improvements in efficiency and interpretability when contrasted with traditional PMOR and ANN-based closure modeling.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reversals in a geodynamo model with a stably-stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the process of magnetic reversals in the presence of a stably-stratified layer below the core-mantle boundary using direct numerical simulations of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations under the Boussinesq approximation in a spherical shell. We show that the dipolar-multipolar transition shifts to larger Rayleigh numbers in the presence of a stably-stratified layer, and that the dipolar strength of the magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary increases due to the skin effect. By imposing an heterogeneous heat flux at the outer boundary, we break the equatorial symmetry of the flow, and show that different heat flux patterns can trigger different dynamo solutions, such as hemispheric dynamos and polarity reversals. Using kinematic dynamo simulations, we show that the stably-stratified layer leads to similar growth rates of the dipole and quadrupole components of the magnetic field, playing the role of a conducting boundary layer, favouring magnetic reversals, and a dynamics predicted by low-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Analysis and reformulation of the $k$--$\omega$ turbulence model for buoyancy-driven thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representation of buoyancy-driven turbulence in Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) models remains unresolved, with no widely accepted standard formulation. A key difficulty is the lack of analytical guidance for incorporating buoyant effects, particularly under unstable stratification. This study derives an analytical solution of the standard $k$--$\omega$ model for Rayleigh--B\'enard convection in an infinite layer, where turbulent kinetic energy is generated solely by buoyancy. The solution provides explicit scaling relations among the Rayleigh ($Ra$), Prandtl ($Pr$), and Nusselt ($Nu$) numbers that capture the simulation trends: $Nu \sim Ra^{1/3} Pr^{1/3}$ for $Pr \ll 1$ and $Nu \sim Ra^{1/3} Pr^{-0.415}$ for $Pr \gg 1$. This framework quantifies the discrepancies in the conventional buoyancy treatment and clarifies their origin. Informed by this analysis, the buoyancy-related modeling terms are reformulated to recover the measured trends: namely $Nu \sim Pr^{1/8}$ for $Pr \ll 1$ and $Nu \sim Pr^{0}$ for $Pr \gg 1$ at moderate $Ra$. Only two dimensionless algebraic functions are introduced, which vanish in the absence of buoyancy, ensuring full compatibility with the standard closure. The corrected model is validated across a range of buoyancy-driven flows, including two-dimensional Rayleigh--B\'enard convection, internally heated convection in two configurations, unstably stratified Couette flow, and vertically heated natural convection with varying aspect ratios. Across all cases, the corrected model provides significantly improved predictions of mean temperature fields and turbulent heat flux distributions.</description>

      <title>Development and Experimental Validation of Novel Evaluation Criteria for Turbulent Two-Phase VOF Simulations in High-Pressure Die Casting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Air entrapment during mold filling critically affects porosity and overall casting quality in High Pressure Die Casting. This study assesses the feasibility of applying the vof method within OpenFOAM to simulate compressible, turbulent mold filling in a thin-walled geometry. Three-dimensional simulations with the "compressibleInterFoam" solver were carried out under ambient initial cavity conditions, using both laminar flow and the k-e turbulence model. The free surface dynamics were examined across a range of inlet velocities to evaluate their influence on interface morphology, cavity pressurization, and gas entrapment. To quantify these effects, three evaluation criteria were introduced: the TIFSA as a measure of oxidation risk, the TMVF as an indicator of filling continuity and air entrapment, and the TIVF as a proxy for surface loading. Results show that turbulence modeling accelerates pressurization and limits the persistence of entrapped gas, with velocity governing the balance between smooth filling, turbulent breakup, and exposure duration. Comparison with experimental casting trials, including CT based porosity analysis and photogrammetric surface evaluation, validated that the model captures key defect mechanisms and provides quantitative guidance for process optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been applied to simulate multiphase flows, yet they are limited in modeling phase changes and sharp interfaces due to optimization conflicts in the strongly coupled Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, and Navier-Stokes equations and the intrinsic smoothness bias of neural representations near discontinuities. To mitigate these limitations, this study presents a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) based on the phase-field method to resolve sharp interfaces and phase changes in multiphase flows. It incorporates a discontinuity-aware network architecture to mitigate spectral bias and automatically detect and model sharp interfacial dynamics, and a learnable local artificial viscosity term to stabilize the calculation near steep gradients. During optimization, adaptive time-marching and loss-balancing strategies are employed to reduce long-horizon errors and mitigate gradient conflicts, ensuring accurate capture of phase changes. Numerical experiments on two-phase reversed single-vortex and bubble-rising problems demonstrate that DPINN accurately resolves sharp interfacial dynamics, while conventional PINNs fail to converge. The method is further extended and tested in a three-phase droplet-icing case, where the viscosity and density ratios between ice, water, and air exceed seven and three orders of magnitude, respectively. The predicted phase change dynamics and sharp pointy-tip formation show excellent agreement with the reference, highlighting the robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the Brinkman-regularized Stokes equations of the membrane-subphase system, we construct the near- and far-field dipolar velocity and associated stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a position-based Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of N dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. We demonstrate this Hamiltonian structure by simulating ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the near-field and far-field Hamiltonians. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations. Our work thus provides a concrete realization of position-based Hamiltonian descriptions for active particles in incompressible fluid membranes and establishes the important roles of membrane incompressibility and fluid vorticity that leads to the emergence of such Hamiltonian descriptions.</description>
