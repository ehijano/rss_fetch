      <title>Expanding Conservation Science through Emerging Interdisciplinary STEM Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation science is an interdisciplinary field that primarily draws on knowledge from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to inform policy, planning, and practice. Since its formalization as a discipline, conservation science has also increasingly incorporated tools from integrative biological fields, such as animal behavior, genetics, and, more recently, physiology. Given that the biodiversity crisis constitutes one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century, with tremendous consequences for global sustainability and human health, creating a diverse conservation toolbox is important for addressing complex conservation threats. To assess the integration of three emerging integrative biological disciplines (physiology, biomechanics, and technology) into recent conservation science research, we queried publications from five broad-scope conservation-focused journals from 2010-2022. We found that the proportion of published articles incorporating these integrative biological techniques was low, ranging from 0-4% per year. With only 2.1% of total articles accessing tools or techniques from conservation physiology, conservation technology, and conservation biomechanics, we propose that there is still a substantial opportunity for further integration. We provide a case study for each integrative field to illustrate the capacity for its tools to contribute to positive conservation outcomes. We further outline how each field promotes novel or reimagined opportunities for collaborations. Finally, we discuss the interconnectedness of the three fields and how they can support the continuing expansion of conservation science as an evidence-based, action-oriented discipline through the application of a Challenge-Mechanism-Partnership framework.</description>

      <title>The Nexus of Open Science and Innovation: Insights from Patent Citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to analyze the extent to which inventive activity relies on open science. In other words, it investigates whether inventors utilize Open Access (OA) publications more than subscription-based ones, especially given that some inventors may lack institutional access. To achieve this, we utilized the (Marx, 2023) database, which contains citations of patents to scientific publications (Non-Patent References-NPRs). We focused on publications closely related to invention, specifically those cited solely by inventors within the body of patent texts. Our dataset was supplemented by OpenAlex data. The final sample comprised 961,104 publications cited in patents, of which 861,720 had a DOI. Results indicate that across all disciplines, OA publications are 38% more prevalent in patent citations (NPRs) than in the overall OpenAlex database. In biology and medicine, inventors use 73% and 27% more OA publications, respectively, compared to closed-access ones. Chemistry and computer science are also disciplines where OA publications are more frequently utilized in patent contexts than subscription-based ones.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Retraction Dynamics in COVID-19 Research: Patterns, Reasons, and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, while the world sought solutions, some scholars exploited the situation for personal gains through deceptive studies and manipulated data. This paper presents the extent of 400 retracted COVID-19 papers listed by the Retraction Watch database until February 2024. The primary purpose of the research was to analyze journal quality and retraction trends. For all stakeholders involved, such as editors, relevant researchers, and policymakers, evaluating the journal's quality is crucial information since it could help them effectively stop such incidents and their negative effects in the future. The present research results imply that one-fourth of publications were retracted within the first month of their publication, followed by an additional 6\% within six months of publication. One-third of the retractions originated from Q1 journals, with another significant portion coming from Q2 (29.8). A notable percentage of the retracted papers (23.2\%) lacked publishing impact, signifying their publication as conference papers or in journals not indexed by Scopus. An examination of the retraction reasons reveals that one-fourth of retractions were due to numerous causes, mostly in Q2 journals, and another quarter were due to data problems, with the majority happening in Q1 publications. Elsevier retracted 31 of the papers, with the majority published in Q1, followed by Springer (11.5), predominantly in Q2. Retracted papers were mainly associated with the USA, China, and India. In the USA, retractions were primarily from Q1 journals followed by no-impact publications; in China, it was Q1 followed by Q2, and in India, it was Q2 followed by no-impact publications. The study also examined author contributions, revealing that 69.3 were male contributors, with females (30.7) mainly holding middle author positions.</description>

      <title>Two Decades of Scientific Misconduct in India: Retraction Reasons and Journal Quality among Inter-country and Intra-country Institutional Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research stands as a pivotal factor in propelling the progress of any nation forward. However, if tainted by misconduct, it poses a significant threat to the nation's development. This study aims to scrutinize various cases of deliberate scientific misconduct by Indian researchers. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 3,244 retracted publications sourced from the Retraction Watch database. The upward trend in retractions is alarming, although the decreasing duration of retractions indicates proactive measures by journals against misconduct. Approximately 60% of retractions stem from private institutions, with fake peer reviews identified as the primary cause of misconduct. This trend could be attributed to incentivizing publication quantity over quality in private institutions, potentially fostering unfair publishing practices. Retractions due to data integrity issues are predominantly observed in public and medical institutions, while retractions due to plagiarism occur in conference proceedings and non-Scopus-indexed journals. Examining retractions resulting from institutional collaborations reveals that 80% originate from within the country, with the remaining 20% being international collaborations. Among inter-country collaborations, one-third of retractions come from the top two journal quartiles, whereas, in intra-country collaborations, half of the retractions stem from Q1 and Q2 journals. Clinical studies retracted from intra-country collaborations are mostly from Q3 and Q4 journals, whereas in inter-country collaborations, they primarily come from Q1 journals. Regarding top journals by the number of retractions in intra-country collaborations, they belong to the Q2 and Q4 categories, whereas in inter-country collaborations, they are in Q1.</description>

      <title>Methodological Elements: Statistics and Digital Humanities. What Research Perspectives for the Early History of Islam?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of digital humanities has opened new perspectives in the history of Islam: whether dealing with thin or sometimes vast source corpora (such as S\=ira, al-Tbar\=i, al-Dahab\=i, etc.), these tools allow us to approach texts much more effectively from a statistical perspective, in order to support more general hypotheses and move beyond case studies. Drawing on the work of a number of researchers as well as our own, we propose to study the potentialities and limitations posed by computer methods for the history of medieval Islam, keeping in mind that the conclusions may prove useful to researchers of other periods. We will particularly emphasize two tools: the construction and use of relational databases, and more recently, the tagging of sources, with the stated goal of addressing some of the problems posed by the previous method.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models to Enrich the Documentation of Datasets for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent regulatory initiatives like the European AI Act and relevant voices in the Machine Learning (ML) community stress the need to describe datasets along several key dimensions for trustworthy AI, such as the provenance processes and social concerns. However, this information is typically presented as unstructured text in accompanying documentation, hampering their automated analysis and processing. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLM) and a set of prompting strategies to automatically extract these dimensions from documents and enrich the dataset description with them. Our approach could aid data publishers and practitioners in creating machine-readable documentation to improve the discoverability of their datasets, assess their compliance with current AI regulations, and improve the overall quality of ML models trained on them.
  In this paper, we evaluate the approach on 12 scientific dataset papers published in two scientific journals (Nature's Scientific Data and Elsevier's Data in Brief) using two different LLMs (GPT3.5 and Flan-UL2). Results show good accuracy with our prompt extraction strategies. Concrete results vary depending on the dimensions, but overall, GPT3.5 shows slightly better accuracy (81,21%) than FLAN-UL2 (69,13%) although it is more prone to hallucinations. We have released an open-source tool implementing our approach and a replication package, including the experiments' code and results, in an open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Towards the relationship between AIGC in manuscript writing and author profiles: evidence from preprints in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AIGC tools such as ChatGPT have profoundly changed scientific research, leading to widespread attention on its use on academic writing. Leveraging preprints from large language models, this study examined the use of AIGC in manuscript writing and its correlation with author profiles. We found that: (1) since the release of ChatGPT, the likelihood of abstracts being AI-generated has gradually increased; (2) scientists from English-speaking countries are less likely to use AIGC tools for writing assistance, while those from countries with linguistic differences from English are more likely to use these tools; (3) there is weak correlation between a paper's AI-generated probability and authors' academic performance; and (4) authors who have previously published papers with high AI-generated probabilities are more likely to continue using AIGC tools. We believe that this paper provides insightful results for relevant policies and norms and in enhancing the understanding of the relationship between humans and AI.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become important tools in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), enabling new ways to analyze data, treat patients, and conduct research. This bibliometric review aims to provide a panoramic view of how LLMs have been used in BHI by examining research articles and collaboration networks from 2022 to 2023. It further explores how LLMs can improve Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in various BHI areas like medical diagnosis, patient engagement, electronic health record management, and personalized medicine. To do this, our bibliometric review identifies key trends, maps out research networks, and highlights major developments in this fast-moving field. Lastly, it discusses the ethical concerns and practical challenges of using LLMs in BHI, such as data privacy and reliable medical recommendations. Looking ahead, we consider how LLMs could further transform biomedical research as well as healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. This bibliometric review serves as a resource for stakeholders in healthcare, including researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, to understand the current state and future potential of LLMs in BHI.</description>
