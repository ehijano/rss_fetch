      <title>Rigidity and nonexistence of CMC hypersurfaces in 5-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the nonnegative $3$-intermediate Ricci curvature and uniformly positive $k$-triRic curvature implies rigidity of complete noncompact two-sided stable minimal hypersurfaces in a Riemannian manifold $(X^5,g)$ with bounded geometry. The nonnegativity of $3$-intermediate Ricci curvature can be replaced by nonnegative Ricci and biRic curvature. In particular, there is no complete noncompact finite index CMC hypersurface in a closed $5$-dimensional manifold with positive sectional curvature. It extends result of Chodosh-Li-Stryker [to appear in J. Eur. Math. Soc (2024)] to $5$-dimensions. We also prove that complete constant mean curvature hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^5$ with finite index and the mean curvature greater than $\frac{\sqrt{65}}{8}$ must be compact. This improves the previous larger bound $\frac{\sqrt{175}}{\sqrt{148}}$ on the mean curvature.</description>

      <title>SL(n) Contravariant Matrix-Valued Valuations on Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All $\textrm{SL}(n)$ contravariant matrix-valued valuations on polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are completely classified without any continuity assumptions. Moreover, the symmetry assumption of matrices is removed. The general Lutwak-Yang-Zhang matrix turns out to be the only such valuation if $n\geq 4$, while a new function shows up in dimension three. In dimension two, the classification corresponds to the known case of $\textrm{SL}(2)$ equivariant matrix-valued valuations.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Mean Curvature Flow On Capillary Hypersurface Supported On Totally Geodesic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new Minkowski type formula for capillary hypersurfaces supported on totally geodesic hyperplanes in hyperbolic space. It leads to a volume-preserving flow starting from a star-shaped initial hypersurface. We prove the long-time existence of the flow and its uniform convergence to a $\theta$-totally umbilical cap. Additionally, we establish that a $\theta$-totally umbilical cap is an energy minimizer for a given enclosed volume.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish fundamental properties satisfied by Parametrized Hamiltonian Stationary Legendrian Varifolds into the Heisenberg Group. Among other properties we prove the sequential weak closure of this space under local area control, finite topology control and conformal class control. This work is the second part of a project launched in [13] about the realisation by Hamiltonian stationary surfaces of any arbitrary non trivial minmax operations on the area among Legendrian surfaces in every closed Sasaki-Einstein 5 dimensional manifold.</description>

      <title>Hessianizability of surface metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetric quadratic form $g$ on a surface~$M$ is said to be locally Hessianizable if each $p\in M$ has an open neighborhood~$U$ on which there exists a local coordinate chart $(x^1,x^2):U\to\mathbb{R}^2$ and a function $f:U\to\mathbb{R}$ such that, on $U$, we have $$ g = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^i\partial x^j}\,\mathrm{d} x^i\circ\mathrm{d} x^j. $$ In this article, I show that, when $g$ is nondegenerate and smooth, it is always smoothly locally Hessianizable.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Lorentzian and Flat Affine Geometry of $\mathsf{GL}(2,\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the geometry of the connected unit component of the real general linear Lie group $4$ dimensional $G_0$ as a Lorentzian and flat affine manifold.
  As the group $G_0$ is naturally equipped with a bi-invariant Hessian metric $k^+$, relative to a bi-invariant flat affine structure $\nabla$, we examine both structures and the relationships between them. Both structures are defined using the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, the first one through the trace $k(u,v):=\mathrm{trace}(u\circ v)$ and the second by the composition $\nabla_{u^+}v^+:=(u\circ v)^+$, where $u,v\in\mathfrak{g}$. The curvatures, tidal force, and Jacobi vector fields of $(G_0, k^+)$ are determined in Section 1. Section 2 discusses the causal structure of $k^+$, while Section 3 focuses on the developed map relative to $\nabla$ in the sense of C. Ehresmann.</description>

      <title>Finite Diffeomorphism Theorem for manifolds with lower Ricci curvature and bounded energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the space $\cM(n,\rv,D,\Lambda):=\{(M^n,g) \text{ closed }: ~~\Ric\ge -(n-1),~\Vol(M)\ge \rv&gt;0, \diam(M)\le D \text{ and } \int_{M}|\Rm|^{n/2}\le \Lambda\}$ has at most $C(n,\rv,D,\Lambda)$ many diffeomorphism types. This removes the upper Ricci curvature bound of Anderson-Cheeger's finite diffeomorphism theorem in \cite{AnCh}. Furthermore, if $M$ is K\"ahler surface, the Riemann curvature $L^2$ bound could be replaced by the scalar curvature $L^2$ bound.</description>

      <title>The holonomy of spherically symmetric projective Finsler metrics of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the holonomy group of $n$-dimensional projective Finsler metrics of constant curvature. We establish that in the spherically symmetric case, the holonomy group is maximal, and for a simply connected manifold it is isomorphic to $Diff_o({\mathbb S^{n-1}})$, the connected component of the identity of the group of smooth diffeomorphism on the $(n-1)$-dimensional sphere. In particular, the holonomy group of the n-dimensional standard Funk metric and the Bryant-Shen metrics are maximal and isomorphic to $Diff_o({\mathbb S^{n-1}})$. These results are the firsts describing explicitly the holonomy group of n-dimensional Finsler manifolds in the non-Berwaldian (that is when the canonical connection is non-linear) case.</description>

Abstract: We provide conditions under which a Riemann surface $X$ is the asymptotic boundary of a convex co-compact hyperbolic manifold, homeomorphic to a handlebody, of negative renormalized volume. We prove that this is the case when there are on $X$ enough closed curves of short enough hyperbolic length.</description>

      <title>Holography of Higher Codimension Submanifolds: Riemannian and Conformal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a natural generalization to submanifolds of the holographic method used to extract higher-order local invariants of both Riemannian and conformal embeddings, some of which depend on a choice of parallelization of the normal bundle. Qualitatively new behavior is observed in the higher-codimension case, giving rise to new invariants that obstruct the order-by-order construction of unit defining maps. In the conformal setting, a novel invariant (that vanishes in codimension 1) is realized as the leading transverse-order term appearing in a holographically-constructed Willmore invariant. Using these same tools, we also investigate the formal solutions to extension problems off of an embedded submanifold.</description>

      <title>An asymmetric Myers-Nakai theorem for non-reversible Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a generalization of the celebrated Myers-Nakai Theorem for Riemannian manifolds to the framework of non-reversible Finsler manifolds, based on the ideas used in a previous generalization for reversible Finsler manifolds proved in \cite{GJR-13}. In the reversible (i.e. metric) case, the function space used to characterize Finsler isometries is the normed algebra $C^1_b(M)$, of bounded and $C^1$-smooth real valued functions with bounded derivative on a Finsler manifold $M$, endowed with its natural norm. This function space had to be adapted in order for it to reflect the quasi-metric structure of non-reversible Finsler manifolds, resulting in a partial loss of the normed space structure. In order to achieve the desired result, we define new algebraic/quasi-metric structures to model the behavior of the aforementioned function space. The construction is based on the cone of smooth semi-Lipschitz functions.</description>

      <title>A Gromov-Witten approach to $G$-equivariant birational invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 2000s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and the $G$-birational invariants introduced by Kontsevich, Pestun, and Tschinkel in recent pioneering work, along with presenting applications. The final section of this paper explores conjectures and preliminary results regarding gerbes, connections over orbifolds, discrete torsion, and potential approaches via motivic integration and twisted K-theory for $G$-birationality. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Langevin dynamics of rigid inclusions on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a rigid inclusion constrained to move on a curved surface has many applications in biological and soft matter physics, ranging from the diffusion of passive or active membrane proteins to the motion of phoretic particles on liquid-liquid interfaces. Here we construct intrinsic Langevin equations for an oriented rigid inclusion on a curved surface using Cartan's method of moving frames. We first derive the Hamiltonian equations of motion for the translational and rotational momenta in the body frame. Surprisingly, surface curvature couples the linear and angular momenta of the inclusion. We then add to the Hamiltonian equations linear friction, white noise and arbitrary configuration-dependent forces and torques to obtain intrinsic Langevin equations of motion in phase space. We provide the integrability conditions, made non-trivial by surface curvature, for the forces and torques to admit a potential, thus distinguishing between passive and active stochastic motion. We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation in geometric form and obtain fluctuation-dissipation relations that ensure Gibbsian equilibrium. We extract the overdamped equations of motion by adiabatically eliminating the momenta from the Fokker-Planck equation, showing how a peculiar cancellation leads to the naively expected Smoluchowski limit. The overdamped equations can be used for accurate and efficient intrinsic Brownian dynamics simulations of passive, driven and active diffusion processes on curved surfaces. Our work generalises to the collective dynamics of many inclusions on curved surfaces.</description>

      <title>Riemannian radial distributions on Riemannian symmetric spaces: Optimal rates of convergence for parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manifold data analysis is challenging due to the lack of parametric distributions on manifolds. To address this, we introduce a series of Riemannian radial distributions on Riemannian symmetric spaces. By utilizing the symmetry, we show that for many Riemannian radial distributions, the Riemannian $L^p$ center of mass is uniquely given by the location parameter, and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of this parameter is given by an M-estimator. Therefore, these parametric distributions provide a promising tool for statistical modeling and algorithmic design.
  In addition, our paper develops a novel theory for parameter estimation and minimax optimality by integrating statistics, Riemannian geometry, and Lie theory. We demonstrate that the MLE achieves a convergence rate of root-$n$ up to logarithmic terms, where the rate is quantified by both the hellinger distance between distributions and geodesic distance between parameters. Then we derive a root-$n$ minimax lower bound for the parameter estimation rate, demonstrating the optimality of the MLE. Our minimax analysis is limited to the case of simply connected Riemannian symmetric spaces for technical reasons, but is still applicable to numerous applications. Finally, we extend our studies to Riemannian radial distributions with an unknown temperature parameter, and establish the convergence rate of the MLE. We also derive the model complexity of von Mises-Fisher distributions on spheres and discuss the effects of geometry in statistical estimation.</description>

Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence theorem for longest paths in sub-Lorentzian problems, which generalizes the classical theorem for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. We specifically address the case of invariant structures on homogeneous spaces, as the conditions for the existence theorem in this case can be significantly simplified. In particular, it turns out that longest paths exist for any left-invariant sub-Lorentzian structures on Carnot groups.</description>

      <title>Modified extremal K\"{a}hler metrics and multiplier Hermitian-Einstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion of multiplier Hermitian-Einstein metric of type $\sigma$ introduced by Mabuchi, we introduce the notion of $\sigma$-extremal K\"{a}hler metrics on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds, which generalizes Calabi's extremal K\"{a}hler metrics. We characterize the existence of this metric in terms of the coercivity of a certain functional on the space of K\"{a}hler metrics to show that, on a Fano manifold, the existence of a multiplier Hermitian-Einstein metric of type $\sigma$ implies the existence of a $\sigma$-extremal K\"{a}hler metric.</description>

      <title>A note on the volume entropy on harmonic manifolds of hypergeometric type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harmonic manifolds of hypergeometric type form a class of non-compact harmonic manifolds that includes rank one symmetric spaces of non-compact type and Damek-Ricci spaces. When normalizing the metric of a harmonic manifold of hypergeometric type to satisfy the Ricci curvature $\mathrm{Ric} = -(n-1)$, we show that the volume entropy of this manifold satisfies a certain inequality. Additionally, we show that manifolds yielding the upper bound of volume entropy are only real hyperbolic spaces with sectional curvature $-1$, while examples of Damek-Ricci spaces yielding the lower bound exist in only four cases.</description>

      <title>On ends of finite-volume noncompact manifolds of nonpositive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.02295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we confirm a folklore conjecture which suggests that for a complete noncompact manifold $M$ of finite volume with sectional curvature $-1 \leq K \leq 0$, if the universal cover of $M$ is a visibility manifold, then the fundamental group of each end of $M$ is almost nilpotent.</description>

      <title>A Minkowski type inequality with free boundary in space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.03749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Minkowski inequality for a domain supported on any umbilical hypersurface with free boundary in space forms. We generalize the main result in \cite{Xia} into free boundary case and obtain a free boundary version of optimal weighted Minkowski inequality in space forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of two papers that develops a theory of relatively Anosov representations using the original "contracting flow on a bundle" definition of Anosov representations introduced by Labourie and Guichard-Wienhard. In this paper we focus on building families of examples.</description>

      <title>The Schiffer problem on the cylinder and on the $2$-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a family of compact subdomains $\Omega$ of the flat cylinder
  $\mathbb{R}^N\times \mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$ for which the Neumann eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian on $\Omega$ admits eigenfunctions with constant Dirichlet values on $\partial \Omega$. These domains $\Omega$ have the property that their boundaries $\partial \Omega$ have nonconstant principal curvatures. In the context of ambient Riemannian manifolds, our construction provides the first examples of such domains whose boundaries are neither homogeneous nor isoparametric hypersurfaces. The functional analytic approach we develop in this paper overcomes an inherent loss of regularity of the problem in standard function spaces. With the help of this approach, we also construct a related family of subdomains of the $2$-sphere $S^2$. By this we disprove a conjecture in \cite{Souam}.</description>
