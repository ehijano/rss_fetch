      <title>Coupling a vertex algebra to a large center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose a Lie group $G$ acts on a vertex algebra $V$. In this article we construct a vertex algebra $\tilde{V}$, which is an extension of $V$ by a big central vertex subalgebra identified with the algebra of functionals on the space of regular $\mathfrak{g}$-connections $(d+A)$.
  The category of representations of $\tilde{V}$ fibres over the set of connections, and the fibres should be viewed as $(d+A)$-twisted modules of $V$, generalizing the familiar notion of $g$-twisted modules. In fact, another application of our result is that it proposes an explicit definition of $(d+A)$-twisted modules of $V$ in terms of a twisted commutator formula, and we feel that this subject should be pursued further.
  Vertex algebras with big centers appear in practice as critical level or large level limits of vertex algebras. I particular we have in mind limits of the generalized quantum Langlands kernel, in which case $G$ is the Langland dual and $V$ is conjecturally the Feigin-Tipunin vertex algebra and the extension $\tilde{V}$ is conjecturally related to the Kac-DeConcini-Procesi quantum group with big center. With the current article, we can give a uniform and independent construction of these limits.</description>

      <title>Generalized Legendrian racks: Classification, tensors, and knot coloring invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Legendrian racks are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the Legendrian Reidemeister moves. We study algebraic aspects of GL-racks and coloring invariants of Legendrian links.
  We answer an open question characterizing the group of GL-structures on a given rack. As applications, we classify several infinite families of GL-racks. We also compute automorphism groups of dihedral GL-quandles and the categorical center of GL-racks.
  Then we construct an equivalence of categories between racks and GL-quandles.
  We also study tensor products of racks and GL-racks coming from universal algebra. Surprisingly, the categories of racks and GL-racks have tensor units. The induced symmetric monoidal structure on medial racks is closed, and similarly for medial GL-racks.
  Answering another open question, we use GL-racks to distinguish Legendrian knots whose classical invariants are identical. In particular, we complete the classification of Legendrian $8_{13}$ knots.
  Finally, we use exhaustive search algorithms to classify GL-racks up to order 8.</description>

      <title>A Holomorphic perspective of Strict Deformation Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide and discuss complex analytic methods for overcoming the formal character of formal deformation quantization. This is a necessity for returning to physically meaningful statements, and accounts for the fact that the formal parameter $\hbar$ carries the interpretation of Planck's constant. As formal star products are given by a formal power series, this naturally leads into the realm of holomorphic functions and analytic continuation, both in finite and infinite dimensions. We propose a general notion of strict deformation quantization and investigate how one can use established results from complex analysis to think about the resulting objects. Within the main body of the text, the outlined program is then put into practice for strict deformation quantizations of constant Poisson structures on locally convex vector spaces and the strict deformation quantization of canonical mechanics on the cotangent bundle of a Lie group. Numerous auxiliary results, many of which are well-known yet remarkable in their own right, are provided throughout.</description>

      <title>A quantum deformation of the ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a unital associative algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, having $q$ and $k$ as complex parameters, generated by the elements $K^\pm_m$ ($\pm m\geq 0$), $T_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}$), and $G^\pm_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}+{1\over 2}$ in the Neveu-Schwarz sector, $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ in the Ramond sector), satisfying relations which are at most quartic. Calculations of some low-lying Kac determinants are made, providing us with a conjecture for the factorization property of the Kac determinants. The analysis of the screening operators gives a supporting evidence for our conjecture. It is shown that by taking the limit $q\rightarrow 1$ of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ we recover the ordinary ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra. We also give a nontrivial Heisenberg representation of the algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, making a twist of the $U(1)$ boson in the Wakimoto representation of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$, which naturally follows from the construction of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ by gluing the deformed $Y$-algebras of Gaiotto and Rap$\check{\mathrm{c}}$\'{a}k.</description>
