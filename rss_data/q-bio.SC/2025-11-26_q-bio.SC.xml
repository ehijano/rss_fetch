      <title>Plumbing Analog of Molecular Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological information processing often arises from mesoscopic molecular systems operating far from equilibrium, yet their complexity can make the underlying principles difficult to visualize. In this study, we introduce a macroscopic hydraulic model that serves as an intuitive analog for the molecular switching behavior exhibited by G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell membrane. The hydraulic system reproduces the essential structural and functional features of the molecular switch, including the presence of up to three distinct steady state solutions, the characteristic shapes of these solutions, and the physical interpretation of the control parameters governing the behavior of the system. By mapping water flow, energy barrier height, and siphoning dynamics onto biochemical flux, activation energy, and state transitions, the model provides a transparent representation of the mechanisms that regulate GPCR activation. The correspondence between the hydraulic analog and the molecular system suggests several experimentally testable hypotheses about GPCR function. In particular, the model highlights the central role of energy flux, driven by imbalances in ATP/ADP or GTP/GDP concentrations, in activating the molecular switch and maintaining nonequilibrium signaling states. It also identifies two key parameters that primarily determine switch behavior: the energy difference between the active and inactive states and the effective height of the energy barrier that separates them. These results imply that GPCR signaling dynamics may be governed by generalizable physical principles rather than by biochemical details alone. The hydraulic framework thus offers a tractable platform for interpreting complex molecular behavior and may aid in the development of predictive models of GPCR function in diverse physiological contexts.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Direct Targeting and Regulation of RNA Polymerase II by Cell Signaling Kinases"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dabas et al. in Science 2025 report that approximately 117 human kinases directly phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), proposing an extensive, direct biochemical bridge between signal transduction and transcriptional control. Such a sweeping claim that one-fourth of the human kinome directly targets the CTD represents a profound revision of canonical transcriptional biology. However, the evidence presented relies primarily on in vitro kinase assays using short CTD peptides, sparse in-cell validation, and mechanistically incomplete models of nuclear trafficking, chromatin targeting, structural compatibility, and catalytic specificity. In this extended critique, we demonstrate that the conclusions of this study are not supported by current biochemical, structural, cell biological, or genomic data. We outline severe shortcomings in assay design, lack of quantitative kinetics, incompatibilities with known Pol II structural constraints, unsupported assumptions about nuclear localization, inappropriate extension to "direct-at-gene" mechanisms, absence of global transcriptional effects, failure to align with the essential role of canonical CDKs, and missing transparency in dataset reporting. We conclude that the central claims of the study are premature and contradicted by decades of established transcriptional research. Substantial new evidence is required before revising the mechanistic model of Pol II CTD regulation.</description>
