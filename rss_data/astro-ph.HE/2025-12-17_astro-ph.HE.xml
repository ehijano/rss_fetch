      <title>A minimalist approach to BL Lacertae: explaining gamma-ray spectral and temporal variability with a single physical parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eponymous BL Lac object BL Lacertae is one of the most well-monitored active galactic nuclei, frequently observed from radio to gamma rays. Its relatively soft $\gamma$-ray spectrum peaks near 500~MeV, and since 2020 it has undergone an exceptional series of flaring episodes. The observed emission is well described by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models, with negligible contribution from external seed photons. We investigate the physical origin of BL~Lacertae's $\gamma$-ray temporal and spectral variability using data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and show that this variability can be explained by a single varying parameter, namely the electrons' peak energy, $\gamma_p$, under a single-zone SSC scenario with a log-parabolic electron distribution. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate the spectral parameters of BL Lacertae over time, selected from an adaptive-binned gamma-ray light curve. We then study the correlation between the inverse Compton peak luminosity, $L_{IC}$, and the position of this peak on the SED energy axis, $E_p$, and compare it with what is expected for a single-zone SSC scenario when only one parameter is free to vary. We find a correlation $L_{IC} = 10^{42.33\pm0.15\pm0.18_{sys}}E_p^{0.98\pm0.05\pm0.06_{sys}}$, consistent, within the errors, with the linear relation $L_{\mathrm{IC}} \propto E_p$, expected when $\gamma_p$ is the only free parameter in the assumed SSC model. This result supports a minimalist SSC scenario in which changes in $\gamma_p$ dominate the observed temporal and spectral variability of BL~Lacertae.</description>

      <title>Exploring the origins of high-velocity features in SNe Ia with the spectral synthesis code TARDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Appearing as secondary higher-velocity absorption components, high-velocity features (HVFs) have been observed in several absorption lines in many Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The frequency and ubiquity of these components in silicon and calcium features specifically indicates that the mechanism through which they form must be common occurrence among the majority of SNe Ia. Here we present modelling of the HVF evolution in a sample of six well observed SNe Ia with the radiative-transfer code tardis. A base model is derived for each of the SNe to reproduce the photospheric velocity components, followed by a grid of simulations with Gaussian enhancements to the density profile at high velocities. We train a set of neural networks to emulate the impact of these density enhancements upon the simulated silicon line profile. These networks are subsequently used within a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to infer the density enhancement parameters that most closely reproduce the HVF evolution. While we obtain good matches for the silicon profile, we find that a single density enhancement alone cannot simultaneously produce the observed silicon and calcium HVF evolution. Our findings indicate that neither the delayed-detonation mechanism, nor the double-detonation mechanism can produce these HVFs, suggesting that something may be missing from the models.</description>

      <title>A wide-field X-ray search for the Geminga pulsar halo with SRG/ART-XC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for the putative large-scale X-ray halo around the Geminga pulsar have been extensively performed using various narrow field-of-view X-ray telescopes. In this paper, we present wide-field scanning observation of Geminga with SRG/ART-XC. Our X-ray analysis provides, for the first time, direct imaging of a $3.5^\circ \times 3.5^\circ$ region in the $4-12$ keV energy band, comparable in extent to the expected Geminga emission. The ART-XC observation provides a highly uniform sky coverage without strong vignetting effects. The synchrotron X-ray halo flux was predicted using a physical model based on particle injection, diffusion, and cooling over the pulsar's lifetime, as well as the spectral and spatial properties of the synchrotron X-ray and inverse-Compton gamma-ray emissions. The model is tuned to reproduce existing multiwavelength data from X-ray upper limits and GeV to TeV gamma-ray observations. After accounting for the high particle background and its uncertainties, no significant emission is found in the assumed source region, and X-ray flux upper limits are derived. These limits are less constraining by up to a factor of three with respect to existing results obtained with narrow field-of-view telescopes and longer exposure times. Nonetheless, we place direct and independent constraints on Geminga's ambient magnetic field strength, which are compatible with other studies. Our methodology, including simulation for longer observation times, is applied for the first time to the wide field-of-view search for pulsar halos. Using extensive simulations, we also show that a 68% probability of detecting the Geminga pulsar halo can be achieved with a 20-day SRG/ART-XC exposure for a 3 $\mu G$ magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Fermi-LAT detections of novae V1723 Sco and V6598 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Numerous classical novae have been observed to emit {\gamma}-rays (E &gt; 100 MeV) detected by the Fermi-LAT. The prevailing hypothesis attributes this emission to the interaction of accelerated particles within shocks in the nova ejecta. However, the lack of non-thermal X-ray detection coincident with the {\gamma}-rays remains a challenge to this theory. Methods. We performed similar analyses of the Fermi-LAT data for both novae to determine the duration, localization, and spectral properties of the {\gamma}-ray emission. These results were compared with optical data from the AAVSO database and X-ray observations from NuSTAR, available for V1723 Sco 2024 only, to infer the nature of the accelerated particles. Finally, we used a physical emission model to extract key parameters related to particle acceleration. Results. V1723 Sco 2024 was found to be a very bright {\gamma}-ray source with an emission duration of 15 days allowing us to constrain the spectral index and the total energy of accelerated protons. Despite early NuSTAR observations, no non-thermal X-ray emission was detected simultaneously with the {\gamma}-rays. However, unexpected {\gamma}-ray and thermal hard X-ray emission were observed more than 40 days after the nova outburst, suggesting that particle acceleration can occur even several weeks post-eruption. V6598 Sgr 2023, on the other hand, was detected by the Fermi-LAT at a significance level of 4{\sigma}over just two days, one of the shortest {\gamma}-ray emission durations ever recorded, coinciding with a rapid decline in optical brightness. Finally, the high ratio of {\gamma}-ray to optical luminosities and {\gamma}-ray to X-ray luminosities for both novae, as well as the curvature of the {\gamma}-ray spectrum of V1723 Sco below 500 MeV, are all more consistent with the hadronic than the leptonic scenario for {\gamma}-ray generation in novae.</description>

      <title>INTEGRAL IBIS catalog of magnetar bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the distinctive properties of magnetars, young neutron stars powered mainly by magnetic energy, is the emission of short ($\lesssim$1 s) bursts of hard X-rays. Such bursts have been observed in nearly all the known magnetars, although at different and time-variable rates of occurrence. In the last two decades, the INTEGRAL satellite has extensively covered with good imaging capabilities the Galactic plane, where most magnetars reside. We present the results of a comprehensive search for magnetar bursts in more than twenty years of archival data of the INTEGRAL IBIS instrument (15 keV - 1 MeV). This led to the detection of 1349 bursts with 30-150 keV fluence in the $\sim2\times10^{-9} - 3\times10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ range from 21 of the 34 examined magnetars and candidate magnetars with well known positions. The durations of the bursts, in terms of $T_{90}$, follow a lognormal distribution centered at $\sim0.1$ s. Most of the detected bursts originated from three particularly active sources: 1E 1547-5408, SGR 1806-20, and SGR 1935+2154. The integral distributions of their burst fluences follow power laws with slopes $\beta$= 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.95$\pm$0.06, and 0.92$\pm$0.10, respectively. The burst spectra are generally well fit with an exponentially cut-off power law with peak energy $E_{peak}$ in the range $\sim20-60$ keV for SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1935+2154, while the bursts of 1E 1547-5408 are slightly harder ($E_{peak}\sim35-100$ keV). A significant anti-correlation between $E_{peak}$ and fluence is found for SGR 1806-20, which provided the largest number of bursts among the sources of our sample.</description>

      <title>A one-parameter two-zone leptonic model for the blazar sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars, a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets aligned close to our line of sight, emit highly variable non-thermal radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. The physical origin of their emission and the blazar sequence remain open questions. We present a self-consistent two-zone leptonic model in which relativistic electrons accelerate in a compact region, losing energy via synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, and escape into a larger zone permeated by an external photon field associated with magnetohydrodynamic winds from the accretion disk. By varying only the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole, the model naturally reproduces the blazar sequence, including Compton Dominance, $\gamma$-ray spectral indices, and the positions of synchrotron and inverse Compton peaks, while variations in secondary parameters account for the observed spread in the data. Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars exhibit strong external Compton emission from the extended zone, whereas BL Lac objects are dominated by synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from the compact acceleration region. This framework highlights the key role of accretion rate and spatially structured emission zones in shaping blazar spectra and provides a unified interpretation of their diverse phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Probing hadronic interactions at the 100 TeV scale with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive air showers produced by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays ($E &gt; 10^{18}$ eV) in the Earth's atmosphere provide a challenging yet unique channel to probe hadronic interactions at the 100 TeV center-of-mass energy scale. Over more than 20 years of operation, the Pierre Auger Observatory has delivered invaluable insights into the modeling of hadronic interactions at energies beyond human-made particle accelerators. Notably, predictions from current models of hadronic interactions yield a muon deficit that becomes more pronounced with energy when compared to measurements. Presently, the interpretation of the nuclear mass composition estimated from the muon content is in tension with that from direct measurements of the depth of the maximum of electromagnetic profiles. Yet, the measured fluctuations of the muon content of air showers are in agreement with model predictions. These findings hint at small deviations in hadronic models that accumulate throughout the whole shower development rather than at large errors in the calculation of the first hadronic interactions. Also, in an independent, data-driven analysis, we show that the muon deficit can be alleviated if we allow a shift of the predicted depth of the maximum of air-shower profiles by 30 -50 g cm$^{-2}$ towards a heavier mass composition. More recently, we have also provided an updated measurement of the proton-proton cross-section at a center-of-mass energy of 57 TeV and the first estimates of the neutron content of air showers by exploiting late-time signals from the surface scintillator detectors of AugerPrime, the present upgrade of the Observatory. With the advent of AugerPrime, we expect to deliver breakthrough results on the 100 TeV-scale hadronic interactions in the next decade.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical mass-loss rates for Very Massive Stars. I. Investigating the wind kink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation-driven winds are ubiquitous in massive stars, but in Very Massive Stars (VMSs), mass loss dominates their evolution, chemical yields, and ultimate fate. Theoretical predictions have often relied on extrapolations of O star prescriptions, likely underestimating true VMS mass-loss rates. In the first of a series of papers on VMS wind properties, we investigate a feature predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations: a mass-loss `kink' or upturn where the single-scattering limit is breached and winds transition from optically thin to optically thick. We calculate hydrodynamically consistent non-LTE atmosphere models using the PoWR$^\mathrm{HD}$ code, with a grid spanning $40-135M_\odot$ and 12-50 kK at fixed $\log(L_\star/L_\odot) = 6.0$ and solar-like metallicity with $Z=0.02$. Our models confirm the existence of the kink, where the wind optical depth crosses unity and spectral morphology shifts from O star to WNh types. The predicted location of the kink coincides with the transition stars in the Galactic Arches cluster and reproduces the model-independent transition mass-loss rate of $\log(\dot{M}_\mathrm{trans}) \approx -5.16$ from Vink &amp; Gr\"afener (2012). For the first time, we locate the kink at $\Gamma_\mathrm{e} \approx 0.43$ ($M_\star \approx 60M_\odot$) without relying on uncertain stellar masses. Above the kink, mass-loss rates scale much more steeply with decreasing mass (slope ~ 10), in qualitative agreement with MC predictions. We additionally identify two bistability jumps in the mass loss driven by Fe ionisation shifts: the first from FeIV to FeIII near 25 kK and the second from FeIII to FeII near 15 kK. Our models thus provide the first comprehensive confirmation of the VMS mass-loss kink while establishing a mass-loss relation with complex mass and temperature dependencies with consequences for stellar evolution, chemical yields, and the black hole mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>An Excited Dark Matter Solution to the MeV Galactic Center Excesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent COMPTEL data analysis reveals a $\sim$ 2 MeV continuum excess whose spatial distribution closely matches the long-standing 511 keV line observed by INTEGRAL/SPI, indicating a common population of low-energy positrons that is difficult to reconcile with known astrophysical sources or standard thermal dark matter (DM). We show that a minimal Excited Dark Matter (XDM) model naturally explains these features. In this scenario a DM particle $\chi$ is inelastically upscattered into an excited state $\chi^*$, followed by de-excitation $\chi^*\to\chi e^+ e^-$ producing $\sim$2 MeV positrons that reproduce the 511 keV line morphology and the COMPTEL MeV continuum. Using a full cosmic-ray (CR) propagation treatment, we obtain an excellent fit for $m_\chi\simeq$ 1.5 TeV DM particle with mass-splitting $\Delta m =m_{\chi^*}-m_\chi \simeq$ 4 MeV for an inelastic geometric scattering cross section of $\sigma_\textrm{mr}= 3-4\times 10^{-23}\,\textrm{cm}^2$. The same positrons supply a substantial, radially flat contribution to the anomalous Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) ionization rate. This is the first unified treatment of XDM-induced positrons across all three observables, yielding correlated MeV signatures testable by upcoming missions targeting the Galactic MeV band.</description>

      <title>How Mass Flows Through Accretion Discs: A Spectral-Timing Vision for the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how mass and angular momentum flow through accretion discs remains a fundamental unsolved problem in astrophysics. Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Stellar Superradiance and Low-Energy Absorption in Dense Nuclear Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons such as axions and dark photons are well-motivated hypothetical particles, whose couplings to ordinary matter can be effectively constrained by stellar cooling. Limits on these interactions can be obtained by demanding that their emission from the stellar interior does not lead to excessive energy loss. An intriguing question is whether the same microphysical couplings can also be probed through neutron star superradiance, in which gravitationally bound bosonic modes grow exponentially by extracting rotational energy from the star. Although both processes originate from boson-matter interactions, they probe very different kinematic regimes. Stellar cooling probes boson emission at thermal wavelengths, while superradiance is governed by modes whose wavelength is comparable to or greater than the size of the star. Previous work has attempted to relate the microphysical neutron-nucleon scattering and inverse-bremsstrahlung absorption rates directly to the macroscopic growth rate of superradiant bound states. In this work, we re-examine this connection and show that a naive extrapolation of the microphysical absorption rate to the superradiant regime would imply superradiant rates comparable to astrophysical timescales characterised by pulsar spindown. These naive rates are especially high for vector fields. However, we demonstrate that this conclusion changes once collective multiple-scattering effects in dense nuclear matter are taken into account. Repeated nucleon collisions modify the effective low-energy absorption experienced by the bosonic bound state, strongly suppressing the rate relevant for superradiance.</description>

      <title>The multiple facets of millisecond pulsar binaries</title>

Abstract: Millisecond pulsar (MSP) binaries are unique laboratories for studying matter and radiation under extreme conditions that are unattainable on Earth. Recent detections of optical millisecond pulsations from three systems in distinct evolutionary stages have opened an entirely new observational window to investigate particle acceleration, pulsar-disk interplay, and intrabinary wind interactions. These discoveries reveal unexpectedly diverse emission mechanisms across accretion regimes, with optical efficiencies in some systems far exceeding those predicted by rotation-powered models. Despite decades of research, key questions remain unresolved: are optical pulsations a universal property of MSPs? How does the presence of an accretion disk boost the conversion of spin-down power into coherent optical emission? What physical processes drive the observed fast variability, and how do pulsar and companion winds regulate mass transfer and binary evolution? Addressing these fundamental problems requires high-time-resolution optical observations, rapid-response observing capabilities, and time-resolved spectroscopy at moderate spectral resolution to map disk and intrabinary-shock variability. Future facilities dedicated to time domain astronomy present a unique opportunity to perform a systematic exploration of optical pulsars across all MSP evolutionary stages for the first time and answer the above-mentioned fundamental questions.</description>

      <title>Inspiral-Transition-Plunge Gravitational Waveforms Beyond Kerr: A Kerr-Newman Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black hole mergers with asymmetric component masses are key targets for both third-generation ground-based and future space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, offering unique access to the strong-field dynamics of gravity. The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914. These results lay the groundwork for inspiral-transition-plunge waveform modeling in beyond-Kerr spacetimes and for probing non-Kerr signatures in future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: Time-domain astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline the science case for a 30-40 m optical/infrared telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, optimised for transformative time-domain astronomy in the 2040s. Upcoming multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities will reveal fast, faint, rapidly evolving Northern transients whose earliest phases carry decisive diagnostics. A Northern ELT with rapid response, broad wavelength coverage, high time resolution, polarimetric capabilities, and diffraction-limited imaging is essential to capture these phases and secure deep spectroscopy and photometry as transients fade. These capabilities will enable recovery of key physical information and detailed characterisation of transient environments, while also enabling unprecedented studies of accretion phenomena at all scales. Among potential sites, La Palma uniquely combines atmospheric stability, complementary longitude to ESO's ELT, protected dark skies, and robust infrastructure to host this facility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy will be transformed in the 2040s by an unprecedented volume of detections from next-generation gravitational wave, high-energy, and ultra-high energy neutrino, cosmic ray, and time domain observatories. This white paper, prepared for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Expanding Horizons call, outlines the key science questions enabled by this emerging multi-messenger ecosystem, ranging from nucleosynthesis and dense matter physics to cosmology, fundamental physics, and the growth of black holes across cosmic time. We demonstrate that fully exploiting these discoveries requires a step change in optical to near infrared spectroscopic capability, including low latency response, high throughput, and flexible time domain operations across both hemispheres. We argue that without a dedicated large-aperture time domain facility, the scientific return of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s will be considerably limited.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Preprocessing Framework for Improving Rare Transient Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With large numbers of transients discovered by current and future imaging surveys, machine learning is increasingly applied to light curve and host galaxy properties to select events for follow-up. However, finding rare types of transients remains difficult due to extreme class imbalances in training sets, and extracting features from host images is complicated by the presence of bright foreground sources, particularly if the true host is faint or distant. Here we present a data augmentation pipeline for images and light curves that mitigates these issues, and apply this to improve classification of Superluminous Supernovae Type I (SLSNe-I) and Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) with our existing NEEDLE code. The method uses a Similarity Index to remove image artefacts, and a masking procedure that removes unrelated sources while preserving the transient and its host. This focuses classifier attention on the relevant pixels, and enables arbitrary rotations for class upsampling. We also fit observed multi-band light curves with a two-dimensional Gaussian Process and generate data-driven synthetic samples by resampling and redshifting these models, cross-matching with galaxy images in the same class to produce unique but realistic new examples for training. Models trained with the augmented dataset achieve substantially higher purity: for classifications with a confidence of 0.8 or higher, we achieve 75% (43%) purity and 75% (66%) completeness for SLSNe-I (TDEs).</description>

      <title>Search for Gravitational Wave Memory in PPTA and EPTA Data: A Complete Signal Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform searches for gravitational wave memory in the data of two major Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments located in Europe and Australia. Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are the primary sources of gravitational waves in PTA experiments. We develop and carry out the first search for late inspirals and mergers of these sources based on full numerical relativity waveforms with null (nonlinear) gravitational wave memory. Additionally, we search for generic bursts of null gravitational wave memory, exploring possibilities of reducing the computational cost of these searches through kernel density and normalizing flow approximation of the posteriors. We rule out the mergers of SMBHBs with a chirp mass of 10^10 Solar Mass up to 700 Mpc over 18 years of observation at 95% credibility. We rule out the observation of generic displacement memory bursts with strain amplitudes &gt; 10^-14 in brief periods of the observation time but across the sky, or over the whole observation time but for certain preferred sky positions, at 95%$credibility.</description>

      <title>Is gamma-ray burst polarization from photosphere emission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Despite more than half a century of research, the dominant radiation mechanism of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission remains unsolved. Some progress has been made through the analyses of the observational spectra of Swift/BAT, Konus/Wind, and Fermi/GBM, as well as the spectra of the photosphere or synchrotron models, but it is still insufficient to pin down the answer.
  Aims: Combining the spectral and polarization observations, we seek new criteria for model evaluation.
  Methods: We thoughtfully investigate the polarization samples of POLAR and AstroSAT, combining the light curve, the spectral and the polarization parameters.
  Results: The power-law shape of the X-ray afterglows, the $T_{90} \propto (L_{\text{iso}})^{-0.5}$ correlation, and the hard low-energy spectral index $\alpha$ are revealed, thus supporting the photosphere origin. Furthermore, we discover the positive correlation of the $\alpha$ and the polarization degree (PD), which can be consistently explained by the photosphere polarization scenario involving the jet asymmetry from a moderate viewing angle of $\theta_{v}$=0.015.</description>

      <title>The spin-orbit alignment hypothesis in millisecond pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a binary system. The exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disk and the star tends to align the spin and orbital angular momenta on a very short time scale compared to the accretion stage. In this work, we study a subset of $\gamma$-ray MSPs in binaries for which the orbital inclination angle $i$ has been accurately constrained thanks to the Shapiro delay measurements. Our goal is to constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees with the orbital inclination angle $i$, in other words if $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light curves based on the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We found good agreement between the two angles $i$ and $\zeta$ for a significant fraction of our sample, about four fifth, confirming the spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one fifth of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment. The reasons are manifold: either the $\gamma$-ray fit is not reliable or some precession and external torque avoid an almost perfect alignment.</description>

      <title>Can Big Black Holes Merge with the Smallest Black Holes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave measurements of the binary black hole population provide insights into the evolution of merging binaries. We explore potential correlation between mass and mass ratio with phenomenological population models where the minimum mass of the smaller (secondary) black hole can change with the mass of the bigger (primary) black hole. We use binary black hole signals from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog with and without the relatively extreme mass-ratio GW190814. When excluding GW190814, models with a variable minimum mass are disfavoured compared to one with a constant minimum mass, with log Bayes factors of -2.49 to -0.98, indicating that the biggest black holes can merge with the smallest. When including GW190814, a parabola model that allows the minimum mass to decrease with increasing primary mass is favoured over a constant minimum-mass model with a log Bayes factor of 4.44. When allowing the minimum mass to decrease, the overall population distributions remain similar whether or not GW190814 is included. This shows that with added model flexibility, we can reconcile potential outlier observations within our population. These investigations motivate further explorations of correlations between mass ratio and component masses in order to understand how evolutionary processes may leave an imprint on these distributions.</description>

      <title>Particle acceleration up to the synchrotron burn-off limit in relativistic magnetized turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy astrophysics, interpreting observed spectra hinges on understanding the competition between energy gains and radiative losses. To progress along these lines, we report on particle-in-cell simulations of particle acceleration in relativistic, magnetized turbulent pair plasmas including synchrotron radiative losses. Our key finding is that the particle energy spectrum does not terminate at this maximal energy but extends beyond with a steepened spectrum, up to the synchrotron burn-off limit where particles cool within a gyrotime. For our adopted parameters (magnetization $\sigma \approx 1 $ and amplitude $\delta B/B_0\simeq 1$), the particle distribution follows ${\rm d}n/{\rm d}\gamma\propto \gamma^{-s}$ with $s\simeq 3$ below the predicted maximal energy, then steepens to $s\simeq 4$ above. The particle distribution and the radiated synchrotron spectra display strong variability near the cutoff energy down to timescales well below the largest eddy turn-around time. We substantiate our results by demonstrating that the acceleration rate itself displays a broken powerlaw-like distribution whose maximal value is the gyrofrequency. The highest energy particles are accelerated by a generalized Fermi process in ideal electric fields, driven by a gradient of the $4$--velocity field $u_E$ of the magnetic field lines of relativistic amplitude, $\delta u_E \gtrsim c$, ordered on a scale comparable to the particle gyroradius. We contend that this is a generic feature of relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence. Lastly, we apply our results to the Crab nebula, which exhibits a hierarchy of characteristic Lorentz factors similar to that studied here. We conclude that stochastic acceleration in this environment is a promising mechanism for explaining the highest-energy part of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution, and its variability.

      <title>Readdressing the contribution of photonuclear reactions to the muon content of extensive air showers: a heuristic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The indirect ground-based observations of cosmic rays through extensive air showers in modern experiments typically involve the use of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the characteristics of the primary particles. These simulations necessitate assumptions about particle interactions at energies that have not yet been experimentally probed, which introduces systematic uncertainties in key observables, particularly the number of muons. Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\%$ in the estimated number of muons. Furthermore, several potential applications of the suggested method in relation to modern challenges in extensive air shower physics are discussed.</description>

      <title>Genuine Retrieval of the AGN Host Stellar Population (GRAHSP)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The assembly and co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their host galaxy stellar population is a key open questions in galaxy evolution. Stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), are inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED). For galaxies triggering SMBH activity, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contaminates the light at all wavelengths, hampering the inference of galaxy parameters. Incomplete AGN templates can lead to systematic overestimates of the stellar mass, biasing our understanding of AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This challenge has gained further impetus with the advent of sensitive wide-area surveys with millions of luminous AGN, including by eROSITA, Euclid and LSST. We aim to estimate the accuracy and bias of AGN host galaxy parameters and improve upon existing techniques. This work makes two contributions: 1) a new SED fitting code, GRAHSP, with a flexible, empirically motivated AGN model including a power law continuum emission lines, a FeII forest and a flexible infrared torus. We verify that our model reproduces published X-ray to infrared SEDs of AGN to better than 20\% accuracy. A fully Bayesian fit with nested sampling includes uncertainties in the model and the data, making the inference highly robust. 2) we created a benchmark photometric dataset where pure quasars are merged with non-AGN pure galaxies into a hybrid (Chimera) object but with known galaxy and AGN properties. Comparing the true and retrieved $M_\star$, SFR and AGN luminosities shows that previous codes systematically over-estimate $M_\star$ and SFR by 0.5 dex with a wide scatter of 0.7 dex, at AGN luminosities above 10^44 erg/s. In contrast, GRAHSP shows no bias on $M_\star$ and SFR. GRAHSP also estimates more realistic uncertainties. GRAHSP enables characterization of the environmental conditions conducive to black hole growth. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Hints of Primordial Magnetic Fields at Recombination and Implications for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Magnetic Fields (PMFs), long studied as relics of the early Universe, accelerate recombination and have been proposed as a way to relieve the Hubble tension. However, previous studies relied on simplified toy models. Here we use recent evaluations of recombination with PMFs, incorporating full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and detailed Lyman-alpha radiative transfer, to test PMF-enhanced recombination ($b\Lambda$CDM) against observational data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae (SN). Focusing on non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum, we find a preference for present-day total field strengths of approximately 5-10 pico-Gauss. Depending on the dataset combination, this preference ranges from mild ($\sim 1.8\sigma$ with Planck + DESI) to moderate ($\sim 3\sigma$ with Planck + DESI + SH0ES-calibrated SN) significance. The $b\Lambda$CDM has Planck + DESI $\chi^2$ values equal to or better than $\Lambda$CDM while predicting a higher Hubble constant. Future high-resolution CMB temperature and polarization measurements will be crucial for confirming or further constraining PMFs at recombination. Field strengths of 5-10 pico-Gauss align closely with those required for cluster magnetic fields to originate entirely from primordial sources, without the need for additional dynamo amplification.</description>

      <title>Modeling Relative Peak Times of Gravitational Wave Harmonics</title>

Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is essential for extracting their rich physics. A key detail for understanding the physics of mergers is predicting the precise time when the amplitude of the gravitational wave strain peaks, which can differ significantly among the different harmonic modes. We propose two semi-analytical methods to predict these differences using the same three inputs from Numerical Relativity (NR): the remnant mass and spin and the instantaneous frequency of each mode at its peak amplitude. The first method uses the frequency evolution predicted by the Backwards-One-Body model, while the second models the motion of an equatorial timelike geodesic in the remnant black hole spacetime. We compare our models to the SXS waveform catalog for quasi-circular, non-precessing systems and find excellent agreement for $l = |m|$ modes up to $l=8$, with mean and median differences from NR below 1$M$ in nearly all cases across the parameter space. We compare our results to the differences predicted by leading Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate waveform models and find that in cases corresponding to the largest timing differences, our models can provide significant increases in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</title>

Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newtons law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</description>

      <title>SN2017ckj: A linearly declining Type IIb supernova with a relatively massive hydrogen envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present optical observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2017ckj, covering approximately 180 days after the explosion. Its early-time multi-band light curves display no clear evidence of a shock-cooling tail, resembling the behavior of SN2008ax. The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute fitted peak magnitude of $M_{\rm V}=-18.49\pm0.18\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. We estimated a total mass of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized by SN2017ckj of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\ M_\odot$, with a massive H-rich envelope of $M_{\rm env} = 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\ M_\odot$. Both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\rm H_\alpha$ and \Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\sim 3\times10^{-4}M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. At later epochs, the spectra develop broad P-Cygni profiles and become increasingly similar to those of SNe IIb, especially SN2018gk. The late-time spectrum at around 139 days does not show a distinct decline in the strength of $\rm H_\alpha$ emission profile, also indicating a relatively massive envelope of its progenitor. Aside from the $\rm H_\alpha$ feature, the nebular spectrum exhibits prominent emission lines of \Oi, \Caii, [\Caii], and \Mgi], which are consistent with the prototypical SN1993J.</description>

      <title>General Framework for the Spontaneous Scalarization of Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and spherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear electrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual formalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a real scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to the regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free branches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are entropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints, finding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental scalar quasi-normal modes ($&lt; 10\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios), indicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do not rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to explore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes, extending beyond specific Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like cases.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in the cold vector dark matter environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\mu\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.</description>
