      <title>Pulse excitation mode selection via AI Pipeline to Fully Automate the WUCT System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parametric optimization for the ultrasound computed tomography system is introduced. It is hypothesized that the pulse characteristic directly affects the information present in the reconstructed profile. The ultrasound excitation modes based on pulse-width modifications are studied to estimate the effect on reconstruction quality. Studies show that the pulse width affects the response of the transducer and, thus, the reconstruction. The ultrasound scanning parameters, mainly pulse width, are assessed and optimally set by an Artificial Intelligence driven process, according to the object without the requirement of a-priori information. The optimization study uses a novel intelligent object placement procedure to ensure repeatability of the same region of interest, a key requirement to minimize the error. Further, Kanpur Theorem 1 is implemented to evaluate the quality of the acquired projection data and discard inferior quality data. Scanning results corresponding to homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms are presented. The image processing step involves deep learning model evaluating the dice coefficient for estimating the reconstruction quality if prior information about the inner profile is known or a classical error estimate otherwise. The models segmentation accuracy is 95.72 percentage and intersection over union score is 0.8842 on the validation dataset. The article also provides valuable insights about the development and low-level control of the system.</description>

      <title>Ankle Exoskeletons May Hinder Standing Balance in Simple Models of Older and Younger Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans rely on ankle torque to maintain standing balance, particularly in the presence of small to moderate perturbations. Reductions in maximum torque (MT) production and maximum rate of torque development (MRTD) occur at the ankle during aging, diminishing stability. Ankle exoskeletons are powered orthotic devices that may assist older adults by compensating for reduced muscle force and power capabilities. They may also be able to assist with ankle strategies used for balance. However, no studies have investigated their effect on balance in older adults. Here, we model the effect these devices have on stability in physics-based models of healthy young and old adults, focusing on age-related deficits such as reduced MT and MRTD. We show that an ankle exoskeleton moderately reduces feasible stability boundaries in users who have full ankle strength. For individuals with age-related deficits, there is a trade-off. While exoskeletons augment stability in portions of the phase plane, they reduce stability in others. Our results suggest that well-established control strategies must still be experimentally validated in older adults.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model for Skin Sympathetic Nerve Activity Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomic nervous system is important for cardiac function regulation. Modeling of autonomic cardiac regulation can contribute to health tracking and disease management. This study proposed a mathematical model that simulates autonomic cardiac regulation response to Valsalva Maneuver, which is a commonly used test that provokes the autonomic nervous system. Dataset containing skin sympathetic nervous activity extracted from healthy participants' ECG was used to validate the model. In the data collection procedure, each participant was required to perform Valsalva Maneuver. The preliminary result of modeling for one subject is presented, and the model validation result showed that the root measure square error between the simulated and measured average skin sympathetic nervous activity is 0.01mV. The model is expected to be further developed, evaluated using the dataset including 41 subjects, and ultimately applied for capturing the early signs of cardiac dysfunction in the future.</description>

      <title>ACCELERATION: Sequentially-scanning DECT Imaging Using High Temporal Resolution Image Reconstruction And Temporal Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been widely used to obtain quantitative elemental composition of imaged subjects for personalized and precise medical diagnosis. Compared with existing high-end DECT leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the sequentially-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially-scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material decomposition approaches for DECT assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification accuracy of iodine concentration. In this work, we developed a technique to achieve sequentially-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and temporal extrapolation, ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from clinical human subject exams. Results demonstrated the improvement of iodine quantification accuracy using ACCELERATION.</description>

      <title>AutOmatic floW planning for fetaL MRI (OWL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two subsequent deep learning networks, one localizing the fetal chest and one identifying a set of landmarks on a coronal whole-uterus balanced steady-state free precession scan, were trained on 167 and 71 fetal datasets across field strengths, acquisition parameters, and gestational ages and implemented in a real-time setup. Next, a phase-contrast sequence was modified to use the identified landmarks for planning. The OWL pipeline was evaluated retrospectively in 10 datasets and prospectively in 7 fetal subjects (gestational ages between 36+3 and 39+3 weeks). The prospective cases were additionally manually planned to enable direct comparison both qualitatively, by scoring the planning quality, and quantitatively, by comparing the indexed flow measurements. OWL enabled real-time fully automatic planning of the 2D phase-contrast scans in all but one of the prospective participants. The fetal body localization achieved an overall Dice score of 0.94+-0.05 and the cardiac landmark detection accuracy was 5.77+-2.91 mm for the descending aorta, 4.32+-2.44 mm for the spine, and 4.94+-3.82 mm for the umbilical vein. For the prospective cases, overall planning quality was 2.73/4 for the automated scans, compared to 3.0/4 for manual planning, and the flow quantitative evaluation showed a mean difference of -1.8% (range -14.2% to 14.9%) by comparing the indexed flow measurements obtained from gated automatic and manual acquisitions. Real-time automated planning of 2D phase-contrast MRI was effectively accomplished for 2 major vessels of the fetal vasculature. While demonstrated here on 0.55T, the achieved method has wider implications, and training across multiple field strengths enables generalization. OWL thereby presents an important step towards extending access to this modality beyond specialised centres.</description>
