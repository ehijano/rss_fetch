      <title>Effect of Protein Environment on the Shape Resonances of RNA Nucleobases: Insights from a Model System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of amino acid environment on the nucleobase-centered anionic shape resonances in RNA by employing uracil as a model system. Uracil-glycine complexes have been used to model the RNA-protein interactions, and with glycine to model the proximity of amino acid residues to RNA nucleobases. The resonance positions and widths of the complexes have been simulated using the equation of motion coupled cluster method coupled with resonance via Pad\'e approach. The amino acid stabilizes the nucleobase-centered resonances through hydrogen bonding, increasing their lifetime. At the same time, the amino acid-centered resonances strongly couple with the nucleobase-centered resonances, thereby scavenging the electron density away from the nucleobase. At the micro-solvation level, amino acids have a greater influence on nucleobase-centered resonances than that displayed by the aqueous environment.</description>

      <title>X2C Hamiltonian Models in ReSpect: Bridging Accuracy and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its inception, the ReSpect program has been evolving to provide powerful tools for simulating spectroscopic processes and exploring emerging research areas, all while incorporating relativistic effects, particularly spin-orbit interactions, in a fully variational manner. Recent developments have focused on exact two-component (X2C) Hamiltonian models that go beyond the standard one-electron X2C approach by incorporating two-electron picture-change corrections. This paper presents the theoretical foundations of two distinct atomic mean-field X2C models, amfX2C and extended eamfX2C, which offer computationally efficient and accurate alternatives to fully relativistic four-component methods. These models enable simulations of complex phenomena, such as time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopies and cavity-modified molecular properties, which would otherwise be computationally prohibitive. ReSpect continues to evolve, providing state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods and post-processing tools, all available free of charge through our website, www.respectprogram.org, to support researchers exploring relativistic effects across various scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Toward a Unified Theory of Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catalysis lies at the heart of chemical reactivity, yet its foundational principles remain fragmented across the distinct domains of homogeneous, heterogeneous, and enzymatic systems Here, we propose a unifying theoretical model that integrates spatial and temporal dimensions into a single framework, offering a cohesive understanding of catalytic activity across diverse materials and conditions. This model builds upon established kinetic theories, incorporating local site density distributions, time-dependent modulations, and intrinsic reaction rates to deliver a comprehensive description of catalytic performance. By applying this approach, we demonstrate how seemingly disparate catalytic processes, from molecular complexes and single-atom catalysts to complex enzyme systems, can be interpreted through shared physical and chemical principles.</description>

      <title>SEAMM: A Simulation Environment for Atomistic and Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simulation Environment for Atomistic and Molecular Modeling (SEAMM) is an open-source software package written in Python that provides a graphical interface for setting up, executing, and analyzing molecular and materials simulations. The graphical interface reduces the entry barrier for the use of new simulation tools, facilitating the interoperability of a wide range of simulation tools available to solve complex scientific and engineering problems in computational molecular science. Workflows are represented graphically by user-friendly flowcharts which are shareable and reproducible. When a flowchart is executed within the SEAMM environment, all results, as well as metadata describing the workflow and codes used, are saved in a datastore that can be viewed using a browser-based dashboard, which allows collaborators to view the results and use the flowcharts to extend the results. SEAMM is a powerful productivity and collaboration tool that enables interoperability between simulation codes and ensures reproducibility and transparency in scientific research.</description>

      <title>QCMaquis 4.0: Multi-Purpose Electronic, Vibrational, and Vibronic Structure and Dynamics Calculations with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCMaquis is a quantum chemistry software package for general molecular structure calculations in a matrix product state/matrix product operator formalism of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). It supports a wide range of features for electronic structure, multi-component (pre-Born-Oppenheimer), anharmonic vibrational structure, and vibronic calculations. In addition to the ground and excited state solvers, QCMaquis allows for time propagation of matrix product states based on the tangent-space formulation of time-dependent DMRG. The latest developments include transcorrelated electronic structure calculations, very recent vibrational and vibronic models, and a convenient Python wrapper, facilitating the interface with external libraries. This paper reviews all the new features of QCMaquis and demonstrates them with new results.</description>

      <title>Comparing Perturbative and Commutator-Rank-Based Truncation Schemes in Unitary Coupled-Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary coupled cluster (UCC) theory offers a promising Hermitian alternative to conventional coupled cluster (CC) theory, but its practical implementation is hindered by the non-truncating nature of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian ($\bar{H}$). To address this challenge, various truncation strategies have been developed to approximate $\bar{H}$ in a compact and reliable manner. In this work, we compare the numerical performance of approximate UCC with single and double excitations (UCCSD) methods that employ many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and commutator rank based truncation schemes. Our results indicate low-order MBPT-based schemes, such as UCC(2) and UCC(3), yield reasonable results near equilibrium, but they become unreliable at stretched geometries. Higher-order MBPT-based schemes do not necessarily improve performance, as the UCCSD(4) and UCCSD(5) amplitude equations sometimes lack solutions. In contrast, commutator-rank-based truncations exhibit greater numerical stability, with the Bernoulli representation of the BCH expansion enabling more rapid convergence to the UCCSD limit compared to the standard BCH formulation.</description>

      <title>Precise Quantum Chemistry calculations with few Slater Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slater determinants have underpinned quantum chemistry for nearly a century, yet their full potential has remained challenging to exploit. In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to the state of the art. This is obtained by introducing an optimization method that leverages the quadratic dependence of the variational energy on the orbitals of each determinant, enabling an exact iterative optimization, and uses an efficient tensor-contraction algorithm to evaluate the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost that scales as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis.</description>

      <title>Egret-1: Pretrained Neural Network Potentials For Efficient and Accurate Bioorganic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of atomic systems has the potential to revolutionize the design of molecules and materials. Unfortunately, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation scale as O(N!) and remain inaccessible for systems with more than a handful of atoms, forcing scientists to accept steep tradeoffs between speed and accuracy and limiting the reliability and utility of the resultant simulations. Recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that neural network potentials (NNPs) can learn efficient approximations to quantum mechanics and resolve this tradeoff, but existing NNPs still suffer from limited accuracy relative to state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methods. Here, we present Egret-1, a family of large pretrained NNPs based on the MACE architecture with general applicability to main-group, organic, and biomolecular chemistry. We find that the Egret-1 models equal or exceed the accuracy of routinely employed quantum-chemical methods on a variety of standard tasks, including torsional scans, conformer ranking, and geometry optimization, while offering multiple-order-of-magnitude speedups relative to legacy methods. We also highlight important lacunae for future NNP research to investigate, and suggest strategies for building future high-quality models with increased scale and generality.</description>

      <title>Max-Cut graph-driven quantum circuit design for planar spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems, can be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in addressing complex optimization problems.</description>
