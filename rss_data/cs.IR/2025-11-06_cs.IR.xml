      <title>Generative Sequential Recommendation via Hierarchical Behavior Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems in multi-behavior domains, such as advertising and e-commerce, aim to guide users toward high-value but inherently sparse conversions. Leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, likes, shares) is therefore essential. Recent progress on generative recommendations has brought new possibilities for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. However, existing generative approaches face two significant challenges: 1) Inadequate Sequence Modeling: capture the complex, cross-level dependencies within user behavior sequences, and 2) Lack of Suitable Datasets: publicly available multi-behavior recommendation datasets are almost exclusively derived from e-commerce platforms, limiting the validation of feasibility in other domains, while also lacking sufficient side information for semantic ID generation. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework, GAMER (Generative Augmentation and Multi-lEvel behavior modeling for Recommendation), built upon a decoder-only backbone. GAMER introduces a cross-level interaction layer to capture hierarchical dependencies among behaviors and a sequential augmentation strategy that enhances robustness in training. To further advance this direction, we collect and release ShortVideoAD, a large-scale multi-behavior dataset from a mainstream short-video platform, which differs fundamentally from existing e-commerce datasets and provides pretrained semantic IDs for research on generative methods. Extensive experiments show that GAMER consistently outperforms both discriminative and generative baselines across multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>KScaNN: Scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on Kunpeng</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a cornerstone algorithm for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and machine learning applications. While x86-based architectures have historically dominated this domain, the increasing adoption of ARM-based servers in industry presents a critical need for ANNS solutions optimized on ARM architectures. A naive port of existing x86 ANNS algorithms to ARM platforms results in a substantial performance deficit, failing to leverage the unique capabilities of the underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce KScaNN, a novel ANNS algorithm co-designed for the Kunpeng 920 ARM architecture. KScaNN embodies a holistic approach that synergizes sophisticated, data aware algorithmic refinements with carefully-designed hardware specific optimizations. Its core contributions include: 1) novel algorithmic techniques, including a hybrid intra-cluster search strategy and an improved PQ residual calculation method, which optimize the search process at a higher level; 2) an ML-driven adaptive search module that provides adaptive, per-query tuning of search parameters, eliminating the inefficiencies of static configurations; and 3) highly-optimized SIMD kernels for ARM that maximize hardware utilization for the critical distance computation workloads. The experimental results demonstrate that KScaNN not only closes the performance gap but establishes a new standard, achieving up to a 1.63x speedup over the fastest x86-based solution. This work provides a definitive blueprint for achieving leadership-class performance for vector search on modern ARM architectures and underscores</description>

      <title>Discourse-Aware Scientific Paper Recommendation via QA-Style Summarization and Multi-Level Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the challenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints and limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward content-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information. However, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text, neglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic completeness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose OMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective, Method, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning, and structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style summarization module converts raw papers into structured and discourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives align semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels. The final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through contextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly constructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in Precision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that QA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete representations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable content-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing trustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Encoding of Object Centric Event Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Object-Centric Event Data (OCED) is a novel meta-model aimed at providing a common ground for process data records centered around events and objects. One of its objectives is to foster interoperability and process information exchange. In this context, the integration of data from different providers, the combination of multiple processes, and the enhancement of knowledge inference are novel challenges. Semantic Web technologies can enable the creation of a machine-readable OCED description enriched through ontology-based relationships and entity categorization. In this paper, we introduce an approach built upon Semantic Web technologies for the realization of semantic-enhanced OCED, with the aim to strengthen process data reasoning, interconnect information sources, and boost expressiveness.</description>

      <title>CLAX: Fast and Flexible Neural Click Models in JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CLAX is a JAX-based library that implements classic click models using modern gradient-based optimization. While neural click models have emerged over the past decade, complex click models based on probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) have not systematically adopted gradient-based optimization, preventing practitioners from leveraging modern deep learning frameworks while preserving the interpretability of classic models. CLAX addresses this gap by replacing EM-based optimization with direct gradient-based optimization in a numerically stable manner. The framework's modular design enables the integration of any component, from embeddings and deep networks to custom modules, into classic click models for end-to-end optimization. We demonstrate CLAX's efficiency by running experiments on the full Baidu-ULTR dataset comprising over a billion user sessions in $\approx$ 2 hours on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster than traditional EM approaches. CLAX implements ten classic click models, serving both industry practitioners seeking to understand user behavior and improve ranking performance at scale and researchers developing new click models.

      <title>No-Human in the Loop: Agentic Evaluation at Scale for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as judges is increasingly critical for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines. We present ScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36 LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, across multiple product categories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent framework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels via scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM evaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item recommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, with actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Fact-Checking that Integrates Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, and Search-Based Retrieval Agents Improves Interpretable Claim Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating fluent utterances but can lack reliable grounding in verified information. At the same time, knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers deliver precise and interpretable evidence, yet suffer from limited coverage or latency. By integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs and real-time search agents, we introduce a hybrid fact-checking approach that leverages the individual strengths of each component. Our system comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid one - hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient. Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the Supported/Refuted split without task- specific fine - tuning. To address Not enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM reviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking pipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.</description>

Abstract: Machine Translation for English Retrieval of Information in Any Language (MATERIAL) is an IARPA initiative targeted to advance the state of cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). This report provides a detailed description of Information Sciences Institute's (ISI's) Summarization and domain-Adaptive Retrieval Across Language's (SARAL's) effort for MATERIAL. Specifically, we outline our team's novel approach to handle CLIR with emphasis in developing an approach amenable to retrieve a query-relevant document \textit{set}, and not just a ranked document-list. In MATERIAL's Phase-3 evaluations, SARAL exceeded the performance of other teams in five out of six evaluation conditions spanning three different languages (Farsi, Kazakh, and Georgian).</description>

      <title>Two thousand years of the oracle problem. Insights from Ancient Delphi on the future of blockchain oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oracle problem refers to the inability of an agent to know if the information coming from an oracle is authentic and unbiased. In ancient times, philosophers and historians debated on how to evaluate, increase, and secure the reliability of oracle predictions, particularly those from Delphi, which pertained to matters of state. Today, we refer to data carriers for automatic machines as oracles, but establishing a secure channel between these oracles and the real world still represents a challenge. Despite numerous efforts, this problem remains mostly unsolved, and the recent advent of blockchain oracles has added a layer of complexity because of the decentralization of blockchains. This paper conceptually connects Delphic and modern blockchain oracles, developing a comparative framework. Leveraging blockchain oracle taxonomy, lexical analysis is also performed on 167 Delphic queries to shed light on the relationship between oracle answer quality and question type. The presented framework aims first at revealing commonalities between classical and computational oracles and then at enriching the oracle analysis within each field. This study contributes to the computer science literature by proposing strategies to improve the reliability of blockchain oracles based on insights from Delphi and to classical literature by introducing a framework that can also be applied to interpret and classify other ancient oracular mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Human vs. Agent in Task-Oriented Conversations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Task-oriented conversational systems are essential for efficiently addressing diverse user needs, yet their development requires substantial amounts of high-quality conversational data that is challenging and costly to obtain. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in generating synthetic conversations, the extent to which these agent-generated interactions can effectively substitute real human conversations remains unclear. This work presents the first systematic comparison between LLM-simulated users and human users in personalized task-oriented conversations. We propose a comprehensive analytical framework encompassing three key aspects (conversation strategy, interaction style, and conversation evaluation) and ten distinct dimensions for evaluating user behaviors, and collect parallel conversational datasets from both human users and LLM agent users across four representative scenarios under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals significant behavioral differences between the two user types in problem-solving approaches, question broadness, user engagement, context dependency, feedback polarity and promise, language style, and hallucination awareness. We found consistency in the agent users and human users across the depth-first or breadth-first dimensions, as well as the usefulness dimensions. These findings provide critical insights for advancing LLM-based user simulation. Our multi-dimensional taxonomy constructed a generalizable framework for analyzing user behavior patterns, offering insights from LLM agent users and human users. By this work, we provide perspectives on rethinking how to use user simulation in conversational systems in the future.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Graph Neural Networks in Real world: Imbalance, Noise, Privacy and OOD Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-structured data exhibits universality and widespread applicability across diverse domains, such as social network analysis, biochemistry, financial fraud detection, and network security. Significant strides have been made in leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to achieve remarkable success in these areas. However, in real-world scenarios, the training environment for models is often far from ideal, leading to substantial performance degradation of GNN models due to various unfavorable factors, including imbalance in data distribution, the presence of noise in erroneous data, privacy protection of sensitive information, and generalization capability for out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To tackle these issues, substantial efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of GNN models in practical real-world scenarios, as well as enhancing their reliability and robustness. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that systematically reviews existing GNN models, focusing on solutions to the four mentioned real-world challenges including imbalance, noise, privacy, and OOD in practical scenarios that many existing reviews have not considered. Specifically, we first highlight the four key challenges faced by existing GNNs, paving the way for our exploration of real-world GNN models. Subsequently, we provide detailed discussions on these four aspects, dissecting how these solutions contribute to enhancing the reliability and robustness of GNN models. Last but not least, we outline promising directions and offer future perspectives in the field.</description>

      <title>Divide by Question, Conquer by Agent: SPLIT-RAG with Question-Driven Graph Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems empower large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, yet struggle with efficiency-accuracy trade-offs when scaling to large knowledge graphs. Existing approaches often rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements compared to existing approaches.</description>

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes recent work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.</description>
