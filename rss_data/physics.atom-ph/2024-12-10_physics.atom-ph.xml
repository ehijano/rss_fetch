      <title>Electron-impact ionization of Si IV-VIII relevant for inertial confinement fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the ionization of silicon by electron impacts in hot plasmas. Our calculations of the cross sections and rates rely on the Coulomb-Born-Exchange, Binary-Encounter-Dipole and Distorted-Wave methods implemented in the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC), and are compared with measurements and other theoretical values. We use a semi-empirical formula for the cross section, which involves a small set of adjustable parameters. Configuration interaction is taken into account and is shown to affect the cross section at low energy, in particular for Si$^{3+}$. The rate coefficient is then expressed in terms of these parameters and is represented in a large temperature interval, up to 10$^8$ K. As expected, the agreement with measurements improves for increasing ion charges, confirming the applicability of our approach to hot plasma studies such as inertial-confinement fusion, and its reliability.</description>

      <title>Testing for isospin symmetry breaking with extensive calculations of isotope shift factors in potassium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise evaluation of the isotope shift (IS) factors for seven low-lying potassium (K) states is achieved using relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. The energies of these states are assessed and compared with experimental data to confirm the accuracy of the wave functions calculated at varying RCC theory approximations and highlight the significance of many-body and relativistic effects in determining the energies and IS factors of K. Various methods are used to compute the IS factors, with the finite-field (FF) approach yielding results that align with observed and semi-empirical data. This consistency is attributed to orbital relaxation effects that are naturally present in the FF method but emerge only through complex interactions in other techniques. Using the IS factors derived from FF, we review the mean square radius difference between $^{38m}$K and $^{39}$K. From this difference and muonic atom x-ray spectroscopy, we deduce the absolute radius of $^{38m}$K using an updated calculation of the nuclear polarizability effect. Finally, we evaluate the isospin symmetry breaking (ISB) in this isotriplet by integrating the radius of $^{38m}$K with an updated radius of $^{38}$Ca, concluding that the ISB is compatible with zero. This finding offers a stringent benchmark for nuclear model calculations of ISB corrections in nuclear beta decay, which play a key role in determining the $V_{ud}$ matrix element.</description>

      <title>Impact-parameter selective Rydberg atom collision by optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold collisions between two Rydberg rubidium atoms ($^{87}$Rb) are investigated by controlling the impact parameter and collision energy. Optical tweezers are employed to hold one atom stationary while propelling the other to a constant velocity. After the tweezers are deactivated, both atoms are excited to a Rydberg state by a $\pi$-pulse. After a collision, a second $\pi$-pulse is applied. If the stationary atom does not experience a significant momentum transfer and is de-excited to its ground state, it can be recaptured when reactivating the tweezer. The impact parameter dependent collision probability is extracted from the atom loss from the tweezer and used to evaluate the collisional cross section between Rydberg atoms. Quantum and classical simulations of elastic two-body collisions show good agreement with the present experimental data and provide insights into the critical parameter regime where quantum effects become important.</description>

      <title>Clear skies ahead: characterizing atmospheric gravity gradient noise for vertical atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial long-baseline atom interferometer experiments are emerging as powerful tools for probing new fundamental physics, including searches for dark matter and gravitational waves. In the frequency range relevant to these signals, gravity gradient noise (GGN) poses a significant challenge. While previous studies for vertical instruments have focused on GGN induced by seismic waves, atmospheric fluctuations in pressure and temperature also lead to variations in local gravity. In this work, we advance the understanding of atmospheric GGN in vertical atom interferometers, formulating a robust characterization of its impact. We evaluate the effectiveness of underground placement of atom interferometers as a passive noise mitigation strategy. Additionally, we empirically derive global high- and low-noise models for atmospheric pressure GGN and estimate an analogous range for atmospheric temperature GGN. To highlight the variability of temperature-induced noise, we compare data from two prospective experimental sites. Our findings establish atmospheric GGN as comparable to seismic noise in its impact and underscore the importance of including these effects in site selection and active noise monitoring for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Influence of momentum confinement in the phase-space dynamics of the Kramers-Henneberger atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase-space dynamics of the Kramers Henneberger (KH) atom solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for reduced-dimensionality models and using Wigner quasiprobability distributions. We find that, for the time-averaged KH potential, coherent superpositions of eigenstates perform a cyclic motion confined in momentum space, whose frequency is proportional to the energy difference between the two KH eigenstates. This cyclic motion is also present if the full time dependent dynamics are taken into consideration. However, there are time delays regarding the time-averaged potential, and some tail-shaped spilling of the quasiprobability flow towards higher momentum regions. These tails are signatures of ionization, indicating that vanishingly small drift momentum is instrumental for stabilization. A comparison of the quasiprobability flow with classical phase-space constraints shows that, for the KH atom, confinement occurs in momentum space. This is a major difference from a molecule, for which the quasiprobability flow is confined in position space for small internuclear separation. Furthermore, we assess the stability of different propagation strategies and find that the most stable scenario for the full dynamics is obtained if the system is initially prepared in the KH ground state.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of time-dependent coherent chiral tunneling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superpositions of handed molecular states give rise to achiral eigenstates, delocalized across a double-well potential via tunneling. A coherent superposition of these energy eigenstates could dynamically relocalize the molecules into chiral states, which has only been addressed theoretically. Here, we present a microwave six-wave mixing pump-probe study to create and probe coherent chiral tunneling dynamics in a rotational state. Through a time-resolved scheme, we uncover the periodic time evolution of the induced chiral wavepacket under field-free conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate precise phase control of this coherence via phase modulation during pump excitation.</description>

      <title>Two-color Ytterbium MOT in a compact dual-chamber setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an experimental scheme for producing ultracold Ytterbium atoms in a compact dual-chamber setup. A dispenser-loaded two-dimensional (2D) magneto-optical trap (MOT) using permanent magnets and operating on the broad $^1S_0\to {}^1P_1$ singlet transition delivers over $10^7$ atoms per second through a differential pumping stage into a three-dimensional (3D) MOT. The two-color 3D MOT uses the broad singlet transition to accumulate $\sim\!2\times 10^7$ atoms of $^{174}\text{Yb}$ within $2.5~\text{s}$ and subsequently the narrow $^1S_0\to {}^3P_1$ intercombination line to cool the atomic cloud to below $10~\mathrm{\mu K}$. We report optimized parameters for each stage of the atom collection sequence, achieving high transfer efficiency. We find that shelving into the triplet state during the broad-transition MOT almost doubles the number of trapped atoms.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.011 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.356 eV [Zhang et al., Nature 633, 63 (2024)]. Therefore, the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion provides a unique opportunity to study the nuclear excitation by electron transition process under well-defined atomic conditions in the regime of extremely low nuclear excitation energy. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.27\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV), but drops many orders of magnitude for the value of electronic transition energy within its uncertainty interval. Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap, the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from a few to approximately $7\times10^{19}$ $^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Second-order hyperfine correction to H, D, and $^3$He energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete second-order hyperfine-interaction correction is calculated for centroid energy levels of H, D, and $^3$He atoms. For $^3$He, the corrections of $-2.075$~kHz and $-0.305$~kHz beyond the leading hyperfine-mixing contribution are obtained for the $2^1S$ and $2^3S$ states, respectively. These results shift the nuclear charge radii difference derived from the $^3$He -$^4$He isotope shift and largely resolve the previously reported disagreement between the muonic and electronic helium determinations [van der Werf et al., arXiv:2306.02333 (2023); Schuhmann et al., arXiv:2305.11679 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</description>

      <title>Photophysics of O-band and transition metal color centers in monolithic silicon for quantum communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers in the O-band (1260-1360 nm) are critical for realizing long-coherence quantum network nodes in memory-assisted quantum communications. However, only a limited number of O-band color centers have been explored in silicon hosts as spin-photon interfaces. This study explores and compares two promising O-band defects in silicon: T centers and $^*$Cu (transition metal) color centers. During T center formation, we observed the formation and dissolution of various defects, including the copper-silver-related defect with a doublet line around 1312 nm ($^*$Cu$^{0}_{n}$), near the optical fiber zero dispersion wavelength. We then investigate the photophysics of both T and $^*$Cu centers, focusing on their emission spectra and spin properties to assess their potential for high-fidelity spin-photon interfaces. Additionally, we report a 25\% broadening of the $^*$Cu$^{0}_{0}$ line under a 0.5 T magnetic field, potentially linked to spin degeneracy, suggesting that this defect may provide a promising alternative to T centers for spin-photon interfaces.</description>
