      <title>Low Dimensional Koopman Generalized Eigenfunctions Representation: An Approach to Address Koopman High-Dimensionality Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Paper introduces a methodology to achieve a lower dimensional Koopman quasi linear representation of nonlinear dynamics using Koopman generalized eigenfunctions. The methodology is presented for the analytically derived Koopman formulation of rigid body dynamics but can be generalized to any data-driven or analytically derived generalized eigenfunction set. The presented approach aim at achieving a representation for which the number of Koopman observables matches the number of input leading to an exact linearization solution instead of resorting to the least square approximation method. The methodology is tested by designing a linear quadratic (LQ) flight controller of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Hardware in the loop simulations validate the applicability of this approach to real-time implementation in presence of noise and sensor delays.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control with Mixture of Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of Gaussian process based Model Predictive Control (MPC) in robotic control, its applicability scope is greatly hindered by multimodal disturbances that are prevalent in real-world settings. Here we propose a novel Mixture of Gaussian Processes based Distributionally Robust MPC (MoGP-DR-MPC) framework for linear time invariant systems subject to potentially multimodal state-dependent disturbances. This framework utilizes MoGP to automatically determine the number of modes from disturbance data. Using the mean and variance information provided by each mode-specific predictive distribution, it constructs a data-driven state-dependent ambiguity set, which allows for flexible and fine-grained disturbance modeling. Based on this ambiguity set, we impose Distributionally Robust Conditional Value-at Risk (DR-CVaR) constraints to effectively achieve distributional robustness against errors in the predictive distributions. To address the computational challenge posed by these constraints in the resulting MPC problem, we equivalently reformulate the DR-CVaR constraints into tractable second-order cone constraints. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the recursive feasibility and stability of the proposed framework. The enhanced control performance of MoGP-DR-MPC is validated through both numerical experiments and simulations on a quadrotor system, demonstrating notable reductions in closed-loop cost by 17% and 4% respectively compared against Gaussian process based MPC.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Newton Extremum Seeking using Delays and Time-Periodic Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study prescribed-time extremum seeking (ES) for scalar maps in the presence of time delay. The problem has been solved by Yilmaz and Krstic using chirpy probing and time-varying singular gains. To alleviate the gain singularity, we present an alternative approach, employing delays with bounded time-periodic gains, for achieving prescribed-time convergence to the extremum. Our results are not extensions or refinements but a new methodological direction, even in the absence of the delay on the map. The main result we present compensates the map's delay and uses perturbation-based and the Newton (rather than gradient) approaches. The simultaneous presence of perturbation period, and two delays -- a map delay and a seeking feedback delay -- whose values are different (feedback delay must be longer than map delay), makes for an intricate situation in the design and analysis.
  ES can settle arbitrarily soon after four times the map delay. In the absence of a map delay, the settling time is arbitrarily short, with feedback delay chosen as one quarter of the prescribed settling time, i.e., the search settles after four times any positive feedback delay. In addition to removing the gain singularity of the Yilmaz-Krstic singular-gain prescribed-time ES, we go beyond that method's limitation to operating only up to the terminal time. With the help of averaging theorems in infinite dimension, we conduct a prescribed-time convergence analysis on a suitable perturbation-averaged \textit{target} ES system, which contains the time-periodic gains of the map and feedback delays. Since the notion of ``dead-beat'' Lyapunov stabilization by time-periodic delayed feedback originates from Hale and Verduyn-Lunel (analysis, 1993) and Karafyllis (feedback design, 2006), we refer to our approach to prescribed-time ES as the ``Karafyllis, Hale, Verduyn-Lunel" (KHV) PT-ES approach.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Neural Certificate Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of verifying different properties of discrete time dynamical systems, namely, reachability, safety and reach-while-avoid. To achieve this, we adopt a data driven perspective and using past systems' trajectories as data, we aim at learning a specific function termed \emph{certificate} for each property we wish to verify. The certificate construction problem is treated as a safety informed neural network training process, where we use a neural network to learn the parameterization of each certificate, while the loss function we seek to minimize is designed to encompass conditions on the certificate to be learned that encode the satisfaction of the associated property. Besides learning a certificate, we quantify probabilistically its generalization properties, namely, how likely it is for a certificate to be valid (and hence for the associated property to be satisfied) when it comes to a new system trajectory not included in the training data set. We view this problem under the realm of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning under the notion of compression, and use recent advancements of the so-called scenario approach to obtain scalable generalization bounds on the learned certificates. To achieve this, we design a novel algorithm that minimizes the loss function and hence constructs a certificate, and at the same time determines a quantity termed compression, which is instrumental in obtaining meaningful probabilistic guarantees. This process is novel per se and provides a constructive mechanism for compression set calculation, thus opening the road for its use to more general non-convex optimization problems. We verify the efficacy of our methodology on several numerical case studies, and compare it (both theoretically and numerically) with closely related results on data-driven property verification.</description>

      <title>Design of optimal repetitive control based on EID estimator with adaptive periodic event-triggered mechanism for linear systems subjected to exogenous disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periodic signal tracking and the unknown disturbance rejection under limited communication resources are main important issues in many physical systems and practical applications. The control of such systems has some challenges such as time-varying delay, unknown external disturbances, structure uncertainty, and the heavy communication burden on the sensors and controller. These challenges affect the system performance and may destabilize the system. Hence, in this article, an improved scheme has been designed to overcome these challenges to achieve a good control performance based on optimization technique, and to guarantee the closed-loop system stability. The proposed scheme can be described as: modified repetitive control (MRC) with equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) estimator based on adaptive periodic event-triggered mechanism (APETM). The scheme that has been created is intended for linear systems that experience external disturbances which are not known, and must operate within constraints on communication resources. MRC based on EID has been developed with the goal of achieving periodic reference tracking and enhancing the ability to effectively reject both periodic and aperiodic unknown disturbances. In addition, utilizing APETM to reduce data transmission, computational burden and to save communication resources. Additionally, an optimization method is employed to fine-tune the parameters of the controller, enabling adjustments to the control and learning actions. Overall architecture of the system, incorporating the APETM-MRC with the utilization of an EID estimator and optimal techniques, can be described as a time-varying delay system. Proposed schemes were demonstrated to be effective, feasible, and robust through simulated application.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Efficient AC Power Flow Prediction in Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve the AC Power Flow problem in power grids. AC OPF is essential for minimizing generation costs while meeting the operational constraints of the grid. Traditional solvers struggle with scalability, especially in large systems with renewable energy sources. Our approach models the power grid as a graph, where buses are nodes and transmission lines are edges. We explore different GNN architectures, including GCN, GAT, SAGEConv, and GraphConv to predict AC power flow solutions efficiently. Our experiments on IEEE test systems show that GNNs can accurately predict power flow solutions and scale to larger systems, outperforming traditional solvers in terms of computation time. This work highlights the potential of GNNs for real-time power grid management, with future plans to apply the model to even larger grid systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Experimentation: Bayesian Optimization over Problem Formulation Space for Accelerated Alloy Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerated discovery in materials science demands autonomous systems capable of dynamically formulating and solving design problems. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that leverages Bayesian optimization over a problem formulation space to identify optimal design formulations in line with decision-maker preferences. By mapping various design scenarios to a multi attribute utility function, our approach enables the system to balance conflicting objectives such as ductility, yield strength, density, and solidification range without requiring an exact problem definition at the outset. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through an in silico case study on a Mo-Nb-Ti-V-W alloy system targeted for gas turbine engine blade applications. The framework converges on a sweet spot that satisfies critical performance thresholds, illustrating that integrating problem formulation discovery into the autonomous design loop can significantly streamline the experimental process. Future work will incorporate human feedback to further enhance the adaptability of the system in real-world experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Optimization of Grid-Edge Cyber and Physical Resources for Resilient Power System Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cooperative operation of grid-edge power and energy resources is crucial to improving the resilience of power systems during contingencies. However, given the complex cyber-physical nature of power grids, it is hard to respond timely with limited costs for deploying additional cyber and/or phyiscal resources, such as during a high-impact low-frequency cyber-physical event. Therefore, the paper examines the design of cooperative cyber-physical resource optimization solutions to control grid-tied cyber and physical resources. First, the operation of a cyber-physical power system is formulated into a constrained optimization problem, including the cyber and physical objectives and constraints. Then, a bi-level solution is provided to obtain optimal cyber and physical actions, including the reconfiguration of cyber topology (e.g., activation of communication links) in the cyber layer and the control of physical resources (e.g., energy storage systems) in the physical layer. The developed method improves grid resilience during cyberattacks and can provide guidance on the control of coupled physical side resources. Numerical simulation on a modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based hybrid dynamic modeling and economic predictive control of carbon capture process for ship decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing carbon capture technology on-board ships holds promise as a solution to facilitate the reduction of carbon intensity in international shipping, as mandated by the International Maritime Organization. In this work, we address the energy-efficient operation of shipboard carbon capture processes by proposing a hybrid modeling-based economic predictive control scheme. Specifically, we consider a comprehensive shipboard carbon capture process that encompasses the ship engine system and the shipboard post-combustion carbon capture plant. To accurately and robustly characterize the dynamic behaviors of this shipboard plant, we develop a hybrid dynamic process model that integrates available imperfect physical knowledge with neural networks trained using process operation data. An economic model predictive control approach is proposed based on the hybrid model to ensure carbon capture efficiency while minimizing energy consumption required for the carbon capture process operation. \textcolor{blue}{The cross-entropy method is employed to efficiently solve the complex non-convex optimization problem associated with the proposed hybrid model-based economic model predictive control method.} Extensive simulations, analyses, and comparisons are conducted to verify the effectiveness and illustrate the superiority of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Grid-Forming HVDC Series Tapping Converter Using Extended Techniques of Flex-LCC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses an extension technology for the previously proposed Flexible Line-Commutated Converter (Flex LCC) [1]. The proposed extension involves modifying the arm internal-electromotive-force control, redesigning the main-circuit parameters, and integrating a low-power coordination strategy. As a result, the Flex-LCC transforms from a grid-forming (GFM) voltage source converter (VSC) based on series-connected LCC and FBMMC into a novel GFM HVDC series tapping converter, referred to as the Extended Flex-LCC (EFLCC). The EFLCC provides dc characteristics resembling those of current source converters (CSCs) and ac characteristics resembling those of GFM VSCs. This makes it easier to integrate relatively small renewable energy sources (RESs) that operate in islanded or weak-grid supported conditions with an existing LCC-HVDC. Meanwhile, the EFLCC distinguishes itself by requiring fewer full-controlled switches and less energy storage, resulting in lower losses and costs compared to the FBMMC HVDC series tap solution. In particular, the reduced capacity requirement and the wide allowable range of valve-side ac voltages in the FBMMC part facilitate the matching of current-carrying capacities between full-controlled switches and thyristors. The application scenario, system-level analysis, implementation, converter-level operation, and comparison of the EFLCC are presented in detail in this paper. The theoretical analysis is confirmed by experimental and simulation results.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Hidden Capacity of MMC Through Accurate Quantification of Modulation Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become increasingly important in voltage-source converter-based high-voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) systems. Direct and indirect modulation are widely used as mainstream modulation techniques in MMCs. However, due to the challenge of quantitatively evaluating the operation of different modulation schemes, the academic and industrial communities still hold differing opinions on their performance. To address this controversy, this paper employs the state-of-the-art computational methods and quantitative metrics to compare the performance among different modulation schemes. The findings indicate that direct modulation offers superior modulation potential for MMCs, highlighting its higher ac voltage output capability and broader linear PQ operation region. Conversely, indirect modulation is disadvantaged in linear modulation, which indicates inferior output voltage capability. Furthermore, this paper delves into the conditions whereby direct and indirect modulation techniques become equivalent in steady-state. The study findings suggest that the modulation capability of direct modulation is the same as that of indirect modulation in steady-state when additional controls, including closed-loop capacitor voltage control and circulating current suppression control (CCSC), are simultaneously active. Simulation and experiments verify the correctness and validity.</description>

      <title>Rapid Detection of High-impedance Arc Faults in Medium Voltage Electrical Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-impedance arc faults in AC power systems have the potential to lead to catastrophic accidents. However, significant challenges exist in identifying these faults because of the much weaker characteristics and variety when grounded with different surfaces. Addressing a noteworthy gap in prior research, which largely focused on arc fault detection in low-voltage systems.
  A novel approach has been applied that offers rapid arc fault detection for medium voltage distribution lines. In contrast to existing black-box feature-based approaches, Hankel alternative view of the Koopman (HAVOK) analysis developed from nonlinear dynamics has been applied which offers not only interpretable features but also opens up new application options in the area of arc fault detection. The method displays a much faster detection speed within 0.45 ms making it appropriate for real-time applications. It demonstrates the ability to detect arc faults across various scenarios, boosting its practical importance for stakeholders in safety-critical industries.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Energy Management Application Method considering Smart Home Occupant Behavior using IoT and Real Big Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most far-reaching use cases of the internet of things is in smart grid and smart home operation. The smart home concept allows residents to control, monitor, and manage their energy consumption with minimum loss and self-involvement. Since each household's lifestyle and energy consumption is unique, the management system needs background knowledge about residents' energy consumption behavioral patterns for more accurate planning. To obtain this information, data related to residents' consumption records must be processed. This research has attempted to provide an optimal decentralized management system consisting of interoperable sections to forecast, optimize, schedule, and implement load management in a smart home. Comparing different prediction models using 4 years of 1-min interval real data of a smart home with photovoltaic generation (PV) and electric vehicle (EV), forecasting non-controllable loads and taking a deterministic approach in different scenarios, the system uses mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to provide load scheduling with the objective of an optimal total energy cost reduction with minimum changes in the household's desired consumption compared to the initial state. The results have shown that the proposed system has reliable performance due to the high precision of the forecast and has led to increased energy efficiency, reduced energy cost (up to 62. 05\%), reduced peak-to-average ratio (PAR) (up to 44. 19\%) and reduced standard deviation (SD) (up to 19. 70\%) in net consumption.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reconfigurable Optical Wireless Ether</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) uses light for wireless data transmission, potentially providing faster and more secure communication than traditional radio-frequency-based techniques like Wi-Fi. However, light's high directionality and its limited penetration ability restrict the signal coverage. To address this limitation, we propose an artificial "optical wireless ether" (OWE) fabric. OWE acts as a reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) wave-propagating medium, intelligently enhancing the strength of light signals and redirecting their propagation to cover a broader area. Our proposed ether fabric comprises simple optical signal amplification units, called ether amplifiers (EAs), strategically placed in the environment, e.g., on ceilings. The EAs amplify and propagate signals at the analog level and are agnostic to the signal format: Signals propagate wirelessly between the EAs, losing strength due to attenuation during transmission but regaining it as they pass through the EAs. The key challenge in OWE design lies in the fact that, while increasing EA gains can extend signal coverage, it can also create positive feedback loops, resulting in self-interference and amplifier saturation, which distort the signals -- the key challenge in OWE design. This paper presents a systematic theoretical analysis to prevent amplifier saturation while optimizing the performance of OWE in both single-basic-service-set (single-BSS) and multiple-BSS scenarios. Optimization objectives could include signal-to-noise ratio, resource allocation fairness, and mutual interference. Furthermore, we conducted simulations and experiments to corroborate our theories. To our knowledge, ours is the first experimental demonstration of the feasibility of an artificial ether fabric for extending and guiding light propagation, laying a solid groundwork for future development and exploration of OWE.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Optimization of Robustness in Multiplex Flow Networks Against Cascading Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked systems are susceptible to cascading failures, where the failure of an initial set of nodes propagates through the network, often leading to system-wide failures. In this work, we propose a multiplex flow network model to study robustness against cascading failures triggered by random failures. The model is inspired by systems where nodes carry or support multiple types of flows, and failures result in the redistribution of flows within the same layer rather than between layers. To represent different types of interdependencies between the layers of the multiplex network, we define two cases of failure conditions: layer-independent overload and layer-influenced overload. We provide recursive equations and their solutions to calculate the steady-state fraction of surviving nodes, validate them through a set of simulation experiments, and discuss optimal load-capacity allocation strategies. Our results demonstrate that allocating the total excess capacity to each layer proportional to the mean effective load in the layer and distributing that excess capacity equally among the nodes within the layer ensures maximum robustness. The proposed framework for different failure conditions allows us to analyze the two overload conditions presented and can be extended to explore more complex interdependent relationships.</description>

      <title>Learning the Frequency Dynamics of the Power System Using Higher-order Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, characterised by low inertia and intermittent disturbances, presents substantial challenges to power system stability. As critical indicators of system stability, frequency dynamics and associated oscillatory phenomena have attracted significant research attention. While existing studies predominantly employ linearized models, our findings demonstrate that linear approximations exhibit considerable errors when predicting frequency oscillation dynamics across multiple time scales, thus necessitating the incorporation of nonlinear characteristics. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on higher-order dynamical mode decomposition (HODMD) for learning frequency dynamics. The proposed method offers distinct advantages over alternative nonlinear methods, including no prior knowledge required, adaptability to high-dimensional systems, and robust performance. Furthermore, HODMD demonstrates superior capability in capturing system-wide spatio-temporal modes, successfully identifying modal behaviour that remains undetectable through standard Dynamic Mode Decomposition techniques. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is validated through comprehensive case studies on both IEEE 14-bus and WECC systems.</description>

      <title>AVSim - Realistic Simulation Framework for Airborne and Vector-Borne Disease Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the critical need for rapid epidemic trend identification and effective intervention strategies to mitigate disease progression and its socio-economic impact. Concurrent with emerging threats, endemic diseases like dengue continue to strain healthcare systems, particularly in populous, economically challenged nations. This paper introduces AVSim (Airborne and Vectorborne Simulator), an agent-based model designed to provide granular insights for optimizing resource allocation within existing healthcare management frameworks. AVSim leverages realistic human mobility and behavioral patterns to simulate disease propagation within a detailed, scalable environment encompassing homes, schools, hospitals, and commercial venues. Human movement is modeled based on occupational and behavioral patterns, including age-specific activities. The simulator incorporates age- and environment-specific disease outcomes, host-host and host-vector interactions, and multiple disease stages, including mild, severe, and critical phases. Immunity, quarantine, and hospitalization are also modeled. Furthermore, AVSim supports tracing the path of disease spread, providing micro-level insights into transmission dynamics. Implemented in Python, AVSim offers flexibility and extensibility, enabling users to create highly customized scenarios for airborne and vector-borne disease modeling. Case studies demonstrating AVSim's application to COVID-19 and dengue illustrate its potential for generating actionable epidemic insights, thereby enhancing public health planning and response.</description>

      <title>Toolbox for Developing Physics Informed Neural Networks for Power Systems Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper puts forward the vision of creating a library of neural-network-based models for power system simulations. Traditional numerical solvers struggle with the growing complexity of modern power systems, necessitating faster and more scalable alternatives. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer promise to solve fast the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing power system dynamics. This is vital for the reliability, cost optimization, and real-time decision-making in the electricity grid. Despite their potential, standardized frameworks to train PINNs remain scarce. This poses a barrier for the broader adoption and reproducibility of PINNs; it also does not allow the streamlined creation of a PINN-based model library. This paper addresses these gaps. It introduces a Python-based toolbox for developing PINNs tailored to power system components, available on GitHub https://github. com/radiakos/PowerPINN. Using this framework, we capture the dynamic characteristics of a 9th-order system, which is probably the most complex power system component trained with a PINN to date, demonstrating the toolbox capabilities, limitations, and potential improvements. The toolbox is open and free to use by anyone interested in creating PINN-based models for power system components.</description>

      <title>Stochastic MPC with Online-optimized Policies and Closed-loop Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a stochastic model predictive control method for linear systems affected by additive Gaussian disturbances. Closed-loop satisfaction of probabilistic constraints and recursive feasibility of the underlying convex optimization problem is guaranteed. Optimization over feedback policies online increases performance and reduces conservatism compared to fixed-feedback approaches. The central mechanism is a finitely determined maximal admissible set for probabilistic constraints, together with the reconditioning of the predicted probabilistic constraints on the current knowledge at every time step. The proposed method's reduced conservatism and improved performance in terms of the achieved closed-loop cost is demonstrated in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Inventory Consensus Control in Supply Chain Networks using Dissipativity-Based Control and Topology Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent global and local phenomena have exposed vulnerabilities in critical supply chain networks (SCNs), drawing significant attention from researchers across various fields. Typically, SCNs are viewed as static entities regularly optimized to maintain their optimal operation. However, the dynamic nature of SCNs and their associated uncertainties have motivated researchers to treat SCNs as dynamic networked systems requiring robust control techniques. In this paper, we address the SCN inventory consensus problem, which aims to synchronize multiple parallel supply chains, enhancing coordination and robustness of the overall SCN. To achieve this, we take a novel approach exploiting dissipativity theory. In particular, we propose a dissipativity-based co-design strategy for distributed consensus controllers and communication topology in SCNs. It requires only the dissipativity information of the individual supply chains and involves solving a set of convex optimization problems, thus contributing to scalability, compositionality, and computational efficiency. Moreover, it optimizes the robustness of the SCN to various associated uncertainties, mitigating both bullwhip and ripple effects. We demonstrate our contributions using numerical examples, mainly by comparing the consensus performance with respect to standard steady-state control, feedback control, and consensus control strategies.</description>

      <title>A Review of Conceptualizations of Safety and Risk in Current Automated Driving Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Safety" and "Risk" are key concepts for the design and development of automated vehicles. For the market introduction or large-scale field tests, both concepts are not only relevant for engineers developing the vehicles, but for all stakeholders (e.g., regulators, lawyers, or the general public) who have stakes in the technology. In the communication between stakeholder groups, common notions of these abstract concepts are key for efficient communication and setting mutual expectations. In the European market, automated vehicles require Europe-wide type approval or at least operating permits in the individual states. For this, a central means of communication between regulators and engineers are regulatory documents. Flawed terminology regarding the safety expectations for automated vehicles can unnecessarily complicate relations between regulators and manufacturers, and thus hinder the introduction of the technology. In this paper, we review relevant documents at the UN- and EU-level, for the UK, and Germany regarding their (implied) notions of safety and risk. We contrast the regulatory notions with established and more recently developing notions of safety and risk in the field of automated driving. Based on the analysis, we provide recommendations on how explicit definitions of safety and risk in regulatory documents can support rather than hinder the market introduction of automated vehicles.</description>

      <title>Towards Closing the Gap between Model-Based Systems Engineering and Automated Vehicle Assurance: Tailoring Generic Methods by Integrating Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing, assuring and releasing safe automated vehicles is a highly interdisciplinary process. As complex systems, automated driving systems will inevitably be subject to emergent properties, i. e., the properties of the overall system will be more than just a sum of the properties of its integrated elements. Safety is one example of such emergent properties. In this regard, it must be ensured that effects of emergence do not render an overall system that is composed of safety-approved sub systems unsafe. The key challenges in this regard are twofold: Regarding the interdisciplinary character of the development and assurance processes, all relevant stakeholders must speak a common language and have a common understanding of the key concepts that influence system safety. Additionally, the individual properties of system elements should remain traceable to the system level. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides an interdisciplinary mindset, as well as methods and processes to manage emergent system properties over the entire system lifecycle. By this, MBSE provides tools that can assist the assurance process for automated vehicles. However, concepts from the domain of MBSE have a reputation for not being directly accessible for domain experts who are no experts in the field of Systems Engineering. This paper highlights challenges when applying MBSE methods to the design and development of automated driving systems. It will present an approach to create and apply domain-specific SysML profiles, which can be a first step for enhancing communication between different stake-holders in the development and safety assurance processes.</description>

      <title>Solving Optimal Power Flow on a Data-Budget: Feature Selection on Smart Meter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much data is needed to optimally schedule distributed energy resources (DERs)? Does the distribution system operator (DSO) have to precisely know load demands and solar injections at each bus of the feeder to solve an optimal power flow (OPF)? This work exploits redundancies in OPF's structure and data to avoid communicating such data deluge, and explores the trade-off between data compression and grid's performance. We propose an OPF data distillation framework involving two steps. The DSO first collects OPF data from only a subset of nodes. The DSO subsequently reconstructs the complete OPF data from the partial ones, and feeds them into the OPF solver. Selecting and reconstructing OPF data may be performed to either maximize the fidelity of reconstructed OPF data, or maximize the fidelity of OPF solutions corresponding to reconstructed data. Under the first objective, OPF data distillation is posed as a sparsity-regularized convex problem. Under the second objective, it is posed as a sparsity-regularized bilevel program. Both problems are solved using accelerated proximal gradient (PGD) algorithms. Numerical tests corroborate that the bilevel formulation enhances fidelity and feasibility of reconstructed OPF solutions, and that OPF solutions can be approximated reasonably well even from partial data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Mobile Damped Wave Algorithm (MOMDWA): A Novel Approach For Quantum System Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm, the Multi-Objective Mobile Damped Wave Algorithm (MOMDWA), specifically designed to address complex quantum control problems. Our approach extends the capabilities of the original Mobile Damped Wave Algorithm (MDWA) by incorporating multiple objectives, enabling a more comprehensive optimization process. We applied MOMDWA to three quantum control scenarios, focusing on optimizing the balance between control fidelity, energy consumption, and control smoothness. The results demonstrate that MOMDWA significantly enhances quantum control efficiency and robustness, achieving high fidelity while minimizing energy use and ensuring smooth control pulses. This advancement offers a valuable tool for quantum computing and other domains requiring precise, multi-objective control.</description>

      <title>Vision-in-the-loop Simulation for Deep Monocular Pose Estimation of UAV in Ocean Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a vision-in-the-loop simulation environment for deep monocular pose estimation of a UAV operating in an ocean environment. Recently, a deep neural network with a transformer architecture has been successfully trained to estimate the pose of a UAV relative to the flight deck of a research vessel, overcoming several limitations of GPS-based approaches. However, validating the deep pose estimation scheme in an actual ocean environment poses significant challenges due to the limited availability of research vessels and the associated operational costs. To address these issues, we present a photo-realistic 3D virtual environment leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian splatting, a novel technique that represents 3D scenes by modeling image pixels as Gaussian distributions in 3D space, creating a lightweight and high-quality visual model from multiple viewpoints. This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme. This approach provides a cost-effective solution for testing and validating the autonomous flight of shipboard UAVs, specifically focusing on vision-based control and estimation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Aero-engines Anomaly Detection using an Unsupervised Fisher Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable aero-engine anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring aircraft safety and operational efficiency. This research explores the application of the Fisher autoencoder as an unsupervised deep learning method for detecting anomalies in aero-engine multivariate sensor data, using a Gaussian mixture as the prior distribution of the latent space. The proposed method aims to minimize the Fisher divergence between the true and the modeled data distribution in order to train an autoencoder that can capture the normal patterns of aero-engine behavior. The Fisher divergence is robust to model uncertainty, meaning it can handle noisy or incomplete data. The Fisher autoencoder also has well-defined latent space regions, which makes it more generalizable and regularized for various types of aero-engines as well as facilitates diagnostic purposes. The proposed approach improves the accuracy of anomaly detection and reduces false alarms. Simulations using the CMAPSS dataset demonstrate the model's efficacy in achieving timely anomaly detection, even in the case of an unbalanced dataset.</description>

      <title>Motion Planning of Nonholonomic Cooperative Mobile Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a real-time implementable motion planning technique for cooperative object transportation by nonholonomic mobile manipulator robots (MMRs) in an environment with static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed motion planning technique works in two steps. A novel visibility vertices-based path planning algorithm computes a global piece-wise linear path between the start and the goal location in the presence of static obstacles offline. It defines the static obstacle free space around the path with a set of convex polygons for the online motion planner. We employ a Nonliner Model Predictive Control (NMPC) based online motion planning technique for nonholonomic MMRs that jointly plans for the mobile base and the manipulators arm. It efficiently utilizes the locomotion capability of the mobile base and the manipulation capability of the arm. The motion planner plans feasible motion for the MMRs and generates trajectory for object transportation considering the kinodynamic constraints and the static and dynamic obstacles.

      <title>Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Mixed-Integer Control through Lifted Control Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the finite-horizon distributionally robust mixed-integer control (DRMIC) of uncertain linear systems. However, deriving an optimal causal feedback control policy to this DRMIC problem is computationally formidable for most ambiguity sets. To address the computational challenge, we propose a novel distributionally robust lifted control policy (DR-LCP) method to derive a high-quality approximate solution to this DRMIC problem for a rich class of Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity sets, including the Wasserstein ambiguity set and its variants. In theory, we analyze the asymptotic performance and establish a tight non-asymptotic bound of the proposed method. In numerical experiments, the proposed DR-LCP method empirically demonstrates superior performance compared with existing methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Lie-algebra Adaptive Tracking Control for Rigid Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive tracking control for rigid body dynamics is of critical importance in control and robotics, particularly for addressing uncertainties or variations in system model parameters. However, most existing adaptive control methods are designed for systems with states in vector spaces, often neglecting the manifold constraints inherent to robotic systems. In this work, we propose a novel Lie-algebra-based adaptive control method that leverages the intrinsic relationship between the special Euclidean group and its associated Lie algebra. By transforming the state space from the group manifold to a vector space, we derive a linear error dynamics model that decouples model parameters from the system state. This formulation enables the development of an adaptive optimal control method that is both geometrically consistent and computationally efficient. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. We have made our source code publicly available to the community to support further research and collaboration.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Conformal Prediction: A Theoretical Framework with Coverage Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-scale extension of conformal prediction, an approach that constructs prediction sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal statistical assumptions. Classic conformal prediction relies on a single notion of conformity, overlooking the multi-level structures that arise in applications such as image analysis, hierarchical data exploration, and multi-resolution time series modeling. In contrast, the proposed framework defines a distinct conformity function at each relevant scale or resolution, producing multiple conformal predictors whose prediction sets are then intersected to form the final multi-scale output. We establish theoretical results confirming that the multi-scale prediction set retains the marginal coverage guarantees of the original conformal framework and can, in fact, yield smaller or more precise sets in practice. By distributing the total miscoverage probability across scales in proportion to their informative power, the method further refines the set sizes. We also show that dependence between scales can lead to conservative coverage, ensuring that the actual coverage exceeds the nominal level. Numerical experiments in a synthetic classification setting demonstrate that multi-scale conformal prediction achieves or surpasses the nominal coverage level while generating smaller prediction sets compared to single-scale conformal methods.</description>

      <title>Online Controller Synthesis for Robot Collision Avoidance: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent uncertainty of dynamic environments poses significant challenges for modeling robot behavior, particularly in tasks such as collision avoidance. This paper presents an online controller synthesis framework tailored for robots equipped with deep learning-based perception components, with a focus on addressing distribution shifts. Our approach integrates periodic monitoring and repair mechanisms for the deep neural network perception component, followed by uncertainty reassessment. These uncertainty evaluations are injected into a parametric discrete-time markov chain, enabling the synthesis of robust controllers via probabilistic model checking. To ensure high system availability during the repair process, we propose a dual-component configuration that seamlessly transitions between operational states. Through a case study on robot collision avoidance, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing substantial performance improvements over baseline approaches. This work provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous systems operating in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence and Stability of Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning, and Online Decision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability of Episodic Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning and Online Decision Transformers. These algorithms performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise. Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Variational integrators for optimal control of foldable drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods that preserves geometric invariants of the system such as energy, momentum and symplectic form, are called geometric integrators. These include variational integrators as an important subclass of geometric integrators. The general idea for those variational integrators is to discretize Hamilton's principle rather than the equations of motion and as a consequence these methods preserves some of the invariants of the original system (symplecticity, symmetry, good behavior of energy,...). In this paper, we construct variational integrators for control-dependent Lagrangian systems on Lie groups. These integrators are derived via a discrete-time variational principle for discrete-time control-dependent reduced Lagrangians. We employ the variational integrator into optimal control problems for path planning of foldable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Simulation are shown to validate the performance of the geometric integrator.</description>

      <title>UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Wireless Distributed Networks for 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of intelligent interconnectivity between the physical and human worlds has attracted great attention for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, emphasizing massive capacity, ultra-low latency, and unparalleled reliability. Wireless distributed networks and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), both of which have evolved from centralized paradigms, are two promising solutions for the great attention. Given their distinct capabilities, such as decentralization and collaborative mechanisms, integrating these two paradigms holds great promise for unleashing the full power of 6G, attracting significant research and development attention. This paper provides a comprehensive study on MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks for 6G. In particular, we introduce the basic mathematical background and evolution of wireless distributed networks and MARL, as well as demonstrate their interrelationships. Subsequently, we analyze different structures of wireless distributed networks from the perspectives of homogeneous and heterogeneous. Furthermore, we introduce the basic concepts of MARL and discuss two typical categories, including model-based and model-free. We then present critical challenges faced by MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks, providing important guidance and insights for actual implementation. We also explore an interplay between MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks and emerging techniques, such as information bottleneck and mirror learning, delivering in-depth analyses and application scenarios. Finally, we outline several compelling research directions for future MARL-assisted wireless distributed networks.</description>

      <title>DreamFLEX: Learning Fault-Aware Quadrupedal Locomotion Controller for Anomaly Situation in Rough Terrains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive agility and the ability to traverse diverse terrains. However, hardware issues, such as motor overheating or joint locking, may occur during long-distance walking or traversing through rough terrains leading to locomotion failures. Although several studies have proposed fault-tolerant control methods for quadrupedal robots, there are still challenges in traversing unstructured terrains. In this paper, we propose DreamFLEX, a robust fault-tolerant locomotion controller that enables a quadrupedal robot to traverse complex environments even under joint failure conditions. DreamFLEX integrates an explicit failure estimation and modulation network that jointly estimates the robot's joint fault vector and utilizes this information to adapt the locomotion pattern to faulty conditions in real-time, enabling quadrupedal robots to maintain stability and performance in rough terrains. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamFLEX outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world scenarios, effectively managing hardware failures while maintaining robust locomotion performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoquasistatic wireless power transfer can be used to charge and power electronic devices such as smartphones and small home appliances. However, existing coil-based transmitters, which are composed of wire conductors, have a limited range. Here we show that multimode quasistatic cavity resonance can provide room-scale wireless power transfer. The approach uses multidirectional, widely distributed currents on conductive surfaces that are placed around the target volume. It generates multiple, mutually unique, three-dimensional magnetic field patterns, where each pattern is attributed to different eigenmodes of a single room-scale resonator. Using these modes together, a power delivery efficiency exceeding 37.1% can be achieved throughout a 3 m * 3 m * 2 m test room. With this approach, power exceeding 50 W could potentially be delivered to mobile receivers in accordance with safety guidelines.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Leakage Magnetic Field in Wireless Power Transfer using Halbach Array-Based Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer has the potential to seamlessly power electronic systems, such as electric vehicles, industrial robots, and mobile devices. However, the leakage magnetic field is a critical bottleneck that limits the transferable power level, and heavy ferromagnetic shields are needed for transferring large amounts of power. In this paper, we propose a ferrite-less coil design that generates an asymmetric magnetic field pattern focused on one side of the resonator, which effectively reduces the leakage magnetic field. The key to enabling the asymmetric field pattern is a coil winding strategy inspired by the Halbach array, a permanent magnet arrangement, which is then tailored for wireless power using an evolutionary strategy algorithm. Numerical analyses and simulations demonstrated that the proposed coil structure delivers the same amount of power as spiral coils, while achieving an 86.6% reduction in magnetic field intensity at a plane located 75 mm away from the resonator pair and a power efficiency of 96.0%. We verified our approach by measuring the power efficiency and magnetic field intensity of a test wireless power system operating at 6.78 MHz. These findings indicate that our approach can efficiently deliver over 50 times more power without increasing magnetic field exposure, making it a promising solution for high-power wireless power transfer applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic grasping is facing a variety of real-world uncertainties caused by non-static object states, unknown object properties, and cluttered object arrangements. The difficulty of grasping increases with the presence of more uncertainties, where commonly used learning-based approaches struggle to perform consistently across varying conditions. In this study, we integrate the idea of similarity matching to tackle the challenge of grasping novel objects that are simultaneously in motion and densely cluttered using a single RGBD camera, where multiple uncertainties coexist. We achieve this by shifting visual detection from global to local states and operating grasp planning from static to dynamic scenes. Notably, we introduce optimization methods to enhance planning efficiency for this time-sensitive task. Our proposed system can adapt to various object types, arrangements and movement speeds without the need for extensive training, as demonstrated by real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards Bio-inspired Heuristically Accelerated Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Underwater Multi-Agents Behaviour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the problem of coordination of an autonomous Multi-Agent System which aims to solve the coverage planning problem in a complex environment. The considered applications are the detection and identification of objects of interest while covering an area. These tasks, which are highly relevant for space applications, are also of interest among various domains including the underwater context, which is the focus of this study. In this context, coverage planning is traditionally modelled as a Markov Decision Process where a coordinated MAS, a swarm of heterogeneous autonomous underwater vehicles, is required to survey an area and search for objects. This MDP is associated with several challenges: environment uncertainties, communication constraints, and an ensemble of hazards, including time-varying and unpredictable changes in the underwater environment. MARL algorithms can solve highly non-linear problems using deep neural networks and display great scalability against an increased number of agents. Nevertheless, most of the current results in the underwater domain are limited to simulation due to the high learning time of MARL algorithms. For this reason, a novel strategy is introduced to accelerate this convergence rate by incorporating biologically inspired heuristics to guide the policy during training. The PSO method, which is inspired by the behaviour of a group of animals, is selected as a heuristic. It allows the policy to explore the highest quality regions of the action and state spaces, from the beginning of the training, optimizing the exploration/exploitation trade-off. The resulting agent requires fewer interactions to reach optimal performance. The method is applied to the MSAC algorithm and evaluated for a 2D covering area mission in a continuous control environment.</description>

      <title>Reward-Based Collision-Free Algorithm for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new mission planning algorithm for autonomous robots that enables the reward-based selection of an optimal waypoint sequence from a predefined set. The algorithm computes a feasible trajectory and corresponding control inputs for a robot to navigate between waypoints while avoiding obstacles, maximizing the total reward, and adhering to constraints on state, input and its derivatives, mission time window, and maximum distance. This also solves a generalized prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. The proposed algorithm employs a new genetic algorithm that evolves solution candidates toward the optimal solution based on a fitness function and crossover. During fitness evaluation, a penalty method enforces constraints, and the differential flatness property with clothoid curves efficiently penalizes infeasible trajectories. The Euler spiral method showed promising results for trajectory parameterization compared to minimum snap and jerk polynomials. Due to the discrete exploration space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. A mutation step enhances exploration. Results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to find the optimal waypoint sequence, fulfill constraints, avoid infeasible waypoints, and prioritize high-reward ones. Simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped are presented, complemented by benchmarking and a time-complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Predictive Red Teaming: Breaking Policies Without Breaking Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visuomotor policies trained via imitation learning are capable of performing challenging manipulation tasks, but are often extremely brittle to lighting, visual distractors, and object locations. These vulnerabilities can depend unpredictably on the specifics of training, and are challenging to expose without time-consuming and expensive hardware evaluations. We propose the problem of predictive red teaming: discovering vulnerabilities of a policy with respect to environmental factors, and predicting the corresponding performance degradation without hardware evaluations in off-nominal scenarios. In order to achieve this, we develop RoboART: an automated red teaming (ART) pipeline that (1) modifies nominal observations using generative image editing to vary different environmental factors, and (2) predicts performance under each variation using a policy-specific anomaly detector executed on edited observations. Experiments across 500+ hardware trials in twelve off-nominal conditions for visuomotor diffusion policies demonstrate that RoboART predicts performance degradation with high accuracy (less than 0.19 average difference between predicted and real success rates). We also demonstrate how predictive red teaming enables targeted data collection: fine-tuning with data collected under conditions predicted to be adverse boosts baseline performance by 2-7x.</description>

      <title>Joint parameter and state estimation for regularized time-discrete multibody dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for offline parameter estimation of discrete multibody dynamics with regularized and frictional kinematic constraints. This setting leads to unobserved degrees of freedom, which we handle using joint state and parameter estimation. Our method finds the states and parameters as the solution to a nonlinear least squares optimization problem based on the inverse dynamics and the observation error. The solution is found using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with derivatives from automatic differentiation and custom differentiation rules for the complementary conditions that appear due to dry frictional constraints. We reduce the number of method parameters to the choice of the time-step, regularization coefficients, and a parameter that controls the relative weighting of inverse dynamics and observation errors. We evaluate the method using synthetic and real measured data, focusing on performance and sensitivity to method parameters. In particular, we optimize over a 13-dimensional parameter space, including inertial, frictional, tilt, and motor parameters, using data from a real Furuta pendulum. Results show fast convergence, in the order of seconds, and good agreement for different time-series of recorded data over multiple method parameter choices. However, very stiff constraints may cause difficulties in solving the optimization problem. We conclude that our method can be very fast and has method parameters that are robust and easy to set in the tested scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhancing healthcare infrastructure resilience through agent-based simulation methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical infrastructures face demanding challenges due to natural and human-generated threats, such as pandemics, workforce shortages or cyber-attacks, which might severely compromise service quality. To improve system resilience, decision-makers would need intelligent tools for quick and efficient resource allocation. This article explores an agent-based simulation model that intends to capture a part of the complexity of critical infrastructure systems, particularly considering the interdependencies of healthcare systems with information and telecommunication systems. Such a model enables to implement a simulation-based optimization approach in which the exposure of critical systems to risks is evaluated, while comparing the mitigation effects of multiple tactical and strategical decision alternatives to enhance their resilience. The proposed model is designed to be parameterizable, to enable adapting it to risk scenarios with different severity, and it facilitates the compilation of relevant performance indicators enabling monitoring at both agent level and system level. To validate the agent-based model, a literature-supported methodology has been used to perform cross-validation, sensitivity analysis and test the usefulness of the proposed model through a use case. The use case analyzes the impact of a concurrent pandemic and a cyber-attack on a hospital and compares different resiliency-enhancing countermeasures using contingency tables. Overall, the use case illustrates the feasibility and versatility of the proposed approach to enhance resiliency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credible forecasting and representation learning of dynamical systems are of ever-increasing importance for reliable decision-making. To that end, we propose a family of Gaussian processes (GP) for dynamical systems with linear time-invariant responses, which are nonlinear only in initial conditions. This linearity allows us to tractably quantify forecasting and representational uncertainty, simultaneously alleviating the challenge of computing the distribution of trajectories from a GP-based dynamical system and enabling a new probabilistic treatment of learning Koopman operator representations. Using a trajectory-based equivariance -- which we refer to as \textit{Koopman equivariance} -- we obtain a GP model with enhanced generalization capabilities. To allow for large-scale regression, we equip our framework with variational inference based on suitable inducing points. Experiments demonstrate on-par and often better forecasting performance compared to kernel-based methods for learning dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-limited calibration of entangling gates with robust phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calibration of high-quality two-qubit entangling gates is an essential component in engineering large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, many standard calibration techniques are based on randomized circuits that are only quadratically sensitive to calibration errors. As a result, these approaches are inefficient, requiring many experimental shots to achieve acceptable performance. In this work, we demonstrate that robust phase estimation can enable high-precision, Heisenberg-limited estimates of coherent errors in multi-qubit gates. Equipped with an efficient estimator, the calibration problem may be reduced to a simple optimization loop that minimizes the estimated coherent error. We experimentally demonstrate our calibration protocols by improving the operation of a two-qubit controlled-Z gate on a superconducting processor, and we validate the improved performance with gate set tomography. Our methods are applicable to gates in other quantum hardware platforms such as ion traps and neutral atoms, and on other multi-qubit gates, such as CNOT or iSWAP.</description>

      <title>Rough Stochastic Pontryagin Maximum Principle and an Indirect Shooting Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive first-order Pontryagin optimality conditions for stochastic optimal control with deterministic controls for systems modeled by rough differential equations (RDE) driven by Gaussian rough paths. This Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to systems following stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by Brownian motion, yet it does not rely on forward-backward SDEs and involves the same Hamiltonian as the deterministic PMP. The proof consists of first deriving various integrable error bounds for solutions to nonlinear and linear RDEs by leveraging recent results on Gaussian rough paths. The PMP then follows using standard techniques based on needle-like variations. As an application, we propose the first indirect shooting method for nonlinear stochastic optimal control and show that it converges 10x faster than a direct method on a stabilization task.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Dependent Control Lyapunov Functions for Stabilizing Nonlinear Parameter-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of parameter-dependent (PD) control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for gainscheduled stabilization of nonlinear parameter-varying (NPV) systems under input constraints. It shows that given a PD-CLF, a locally Lipschitz control law can be constructed by solving a robust quadratic program. For polynomial control-affine NPV systems, it provides convex conditions, based on the sum of squares (SOS) programming, to jointly synthesize both a PD-CLF and a PD controller, aimed at maximizing the PD region of stabilization. Input constraints can be straightforwardly incorporated into the synthesis procedure. Unlike traditional linear parameter-varying (LPV) methods that rely on linearization or over-approximation to get an LPV model, the proposed framework fully captures the nonlinearities of the system dynamics. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the method, showcasing its potential for stabilizing NPV systems under input constraints.</description>

      <title>Platelet Inventory Management with Approximate Dynamic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a stochastic perishable inventory control problem with endogenous (decision-dependent) uncertainty in shelf-life of units. Our primary motivation is determining ordering policies for blood platelets. Determining optimal ordering quantities is a challenging task due to the short maximum shelf-life of platelets (3-5 days after testing) and high uncertainty in daily demand. We formulate the problem as an infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Process (MDP). The model captures salient features observed in our data from a network of Canadian hospitals and allows for fixed ordering costs. We show that with uncertainty in shelf-life, the value function of the MDP is non-convex and key structural properties valid under deterministic shelf-life no longer hold. Hence, we propose an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm to find approximate policies. We approximate the value function using a linear combination of basis functions and tune the parameters using a simulation-based policy iteration algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed policy using extensive numerical experiments in parameter regimes relevant to the platelet inventory management problem. We further leverage the ADP algorithm to evaluate the impact of ignoring shelf-life uncertainty. Finally, we evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the ADP algorithm in a case study using real data and compare it to the historical hospital performance and other benchmarks. The ADP policy can be computed online in a few minutes and results in more than 50% lower expiry and shortage rates compared to the historical performance. In addition, it performs better or as well as an exact policy that ignores uncertainty in shelf-life and becomes hard to compute for larger instance of the problem.</description>

      <title>Quantized distributed Nash equilibrium seeking under DoS attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking under Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and quantization. The players can only exchange information with their own direct neighbors. The transmitted information is subject to quantization and packet losses induced by malicious DoS attacks. We propose a quantized distributed NE seeking strategy based on the approach of dynamic quantized consensus. To solve the quantizer saturation problem caused by DoS attacks, the quantization mechanism is equipped to have zooming-in and holding capabilities, in which the holding capability is consistent with the results in quantized consensus under DoS. A sufficient condition on the number of quantizer levels is provided, under which the quantizers are free from saturation under DoS attacks. The proposed distributed quantized NE seeking strategy is shown to have the so-called maximum resilience to DoS attacks. Namely, if the bound characterizing the maximum resilience is violated, an attacker can deny all the transmissions and hence distributed NE seeking is impossible.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new denial-of-service (DoS) estimator, enabling defenders to identify duration and frequency parameters of any DoS attacker, except for three edge cases, exclusively using real-time data. The key advantage of the estimator lies in its capability to facilitate security control in a wide range of practical scenarios, even when the attacker's information is previously unknown. We demonstrate the advantage and application of our new estimator in the context of two classical control scenarios, namely consensus of multi-agent systems and impulsive stabilization of nonlinear systems, for illustration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging cyber-physical systems impel the development of communication protocols that optimize resource utilization. This article investigates infinite-horizon optimal scheduling for resource-aware networked control systems by addressing the rate-regulation tradeoff. Consider a scenario where the sensor and the controller communicate via a networked channel, the transmission scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov decision process on unbounded general state space controlled by scheduling decisions. The value of information (VoI) serves as a metric to assess the importance of sensory data for transmission. We derive the optimal scheduling law for feedback control based on VoI and show that it is deterministic and stationary, with an explicit expression obtained via value iteration. The closed-loop system under the designed scheduling law is shown to be stochastically stable. By analyzing the dynamic behavior of the iteration process, we show that the VoI function and the optimal scheduling law exhibit symmetry. Furthermore, when the system matrix is diagonalizable, the VoI function is monotone and quasi-convex. Consequently, the optimal scheduling law is shown to exhibit a threshold structure and takes a quadratic form, with the threshold region explicitly characterized. Finally, the numerical simulation illustrates the theoretical result of the VoI-based scheduling.</description>

Abstract: We consider a perimeter defense problem in a rooted full tree graph environment in which a single defending vehicle seeks to defend a set of specified vertices, termed as the perimeter from mobile intruders that enter the environment through the tree's leaves. We adopt the technique of competitive analysis to characterize the performance of an online algorithm for the defending vehicle. We first derive fundamental limits on the performance of any online algorithm relative to that of an optimal offline algorithm. Specifically, we give three fundamental conditions for finite, 2, and 3/2 competitive ratios in terms of the environment parameters. We then design and analyze three classes of online algorithms that have provably finite competitiveness under varying environmental parameter regimes. Finally, we give a numerical visualization of these regimes to better show the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the economic performance of nonlinear constrained systems subject to uncertain time-varying parameters and bounded disturbances. In particular, we propose an adaptive economic model predictive control (MPC) framework that: (i) directly minimizes transient economic costs, (ii) addresses parametric uncertainty through online model adaptation, (iii) determines optimal setpoints online, and (iv) ensures robustness by using a tube-based approach. The proposed design ensures recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and a transient performance bound. In case the disturbances have a finite energy and the parameter variations have a finite path length, the asymptotic average performance is (approximately) not worse than the performance obtained when operating at the best reachable steady-state. We highlight performance benefits in a numerical example involving a chemical reactor with unknown time-invariant and time-varying parameters.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov theory demonstrating a fundamental limit on the speed of systems consolidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nervous system reorganizes memories from an early site to a late site, a commonly observed feature of learning and memory systems known as systems consolidation. Previous work has suggested learning rules by which consolidation may occur. Here, we provide conditions under which such rules are guaranteed to lead to stable convergence of learning and consolidation. We use the theory of Lyapunov functions, which enforces stability by requiring learning rules to decrease an energy-like (Lyapunov) function. We present the theory in the context of a simple circuit architecture motivated by classic models of learning in systems consolidation mediated by the cerebellum. Stability is only guaranteed if the learning rate in the late stage is not faster than the learning rate in the early stage. Further, the slower the learning rate at the late stage, the larger the perturbation the system can tolerate with a guarantee of stability. We provide intuition for this result by mapping the consolidation model to a damped driven oscillator system, and showing that the ratio of early- to late-stage learning rates in the consolidation model can be directly identified with the (square of the) oscillator's damping ratio. This work suggests the power of the Lyapunov approach to provide constraints on nervous system function.</description>

Abstract: We present a nonlinear non-convex model predictive control approach to solving a real-world labyrinth game. We introduce adaptive nonlinear constraints, representing the non-convex obstacles within the labyrinth. Our method splits the computation-heavy optimization problem into two layers; first, a high-level model predictive controller which incorporates the full problem formulation and finds pseudo-global optimal trajectories at a low frequency. Secondly, a low-level model predictive controller that receives a reduced, computationally optimized version of the optimization problem to follow the given high-level path in real-time. Further, a map of the labyrinth surface irregularities is learned. Our controller is able to handle the major disturbances and model inaccuracies encountered on the labyrinth and outperforms other classical control methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Cell Decomposition for Path Planning using Restrictive Routing Potential Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In burgeoning domains such as urban goods distribution, the advent of aerial transportation necessitates the development of routing solutions that prioritize safe navigation. This paper introduces Larp, a novel path planning and navigation framework that leverages the concept of repulsive potential fields as continuous cost maps to forge safe routes. The algorithm achieves it by segmenting the potential field into a hierarchy of cells, each with a designated risk zone determined by the proximity of obstacles. The meshing allows the airspace to be partitioned based on an area's potential for restriction violations, enabling navigation that is aware of these risks. While the primary impetus behind Larp is to enhance the safety of aerial pathways for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in urban air mobility, its utility extends to a wide array of routing scenarios. Comparative analyses with both established and contemporary potential field-based methods reveal Larp's proficiency in maintaining a safe distance from restrictions and its adeptness in circumventing local minima. Additionally, large-scale aerial path planning of Austin, TX demonstrates Larp's capability to be implemented at a large scale.</description>

      <title>Certifiably Robust Policies for Uncertain Parametric Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach for producing policies that are provably robust across unknown stochastic environments. Existing approaches can learn models of a single environment as an interval Markov decision processes (IMDP) and produce a robust policy with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on its performance. However these are unable to reason about the impact of environmental parameters underlying the uncertainty. We propose a framework based on parametric Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unknown distributions over parameters. We learn and analyse IMDPs for a set of unknown sample environments induced by parameters. The key challenge is then to produce meaningful performance guarantees that combine the two layers of uncertainty: (1) multiple environments induced by parameters with an unknown distribution; (2) unknown induced environments which are approximated by IMDPs. We present a novel approach based on scenario optimisation that yields a single PAC guarantee quantifying the risk level for which a specified performance level can be assured in unseen environments, plus a means to trade-off risk and performance. We implement and evaluate our framework using multiple robust policy generation methods on a range of benchmarks. We show that our approach produces tight bounds on a policy's performance with high confidence.</description>

      <title>Ergodic-risk Criterion for Stochastically Stabilizing Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ergodic-risk criteria, which capture long-term cumulative risks associated with controlled Markov chains through probabilistic limit theorems--in contrast to existing methods that require assumptions of either finite hitting time, finite state/action space, or exponentiation necessitating light-tailed distributions. Using tailored Functional Central Limit Theorems (FCLT), we demonstrate that the time-correlated terms in the ergodic-risk] criteria converge under uniform ergodicity and establish conditions for the convergence of these criteria in non-stationary general-state Markov chains involving heavy-tailed distributions. For quadratic risk functionals on stochastic linear system, in addition to internal stability, this requires the (possibly heavy-tailed) process noise to have only a finite fourth moment. After quantifying cumulative uncertainties in risk functionals that account for extreme deviations, these ergodic-risk criteria are then incorporated into policy optimizations, thereby extending the standard average optimal synthesis to a risk-sensitive framework. Finally, by establishing the strong duality of the constrained policy optimization, we propose a primal-dual algorithm that optimizes average performance while ensuring that certain risks associated with these ergodic-risk criteria are constrained. Our risk-sensitive framework offers a theoretically guaranteed policy iteration for the long-term risk-sensitive control of processes involving heavy-tailed noise, which is shown to be effective through several simulations.</description>

      <title>Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Models with 1-Bit Measurements: Asymptotics of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes regularity conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality of the multiple parameter maximum likelihood estimator(MLE) from censored data, where the censoring mechanism is in the form of $1$-bit measurements. The underlying distribution of the uncensored data is assumed to belong to the exponential family, with natural parameters expressed as a linear combination of the predictors, known as generalized linear model (GLM). As part of the analysis, the Fisher information matrix is also derived for both censored and uncensored data, which helps to quantify the impact of censoring and assess the performance of the MLE. The choice of GLM allows one to consider a variety of practical examples where 1-bit estimation is of interest. In particular, it is shown how the derived results can be used to analyze two practically relevant scenarios: the Gaussian model with both unknown mean and variance, and the Poisson model with an unknown mean.</description>

      <title>ASAP: Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics for Learning Agile Humanoid Whole-Body Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time-series using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time-series data using reinforcement learning (RL) in the latent space of an autoencoder. A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hallucination Detection through Noise Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating plausible yet incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Effectively detecting hallucinations is therefore crucial for the safe deployment of LLMs. Recent research has linked hallucinations to model uncertainty, suggesting that hallucinations can be detected by measuring dispersion over answer distributions obtained from a set of samples drawn from a model. While drawing from the distribution over tokens defined by the model is a natural way to obtain samples, in this work, we argue that it is sub-optimal for the purpose of detecting hallucinations. We show that detection can be improved significantly by taking into account model uncertainty in the Bayesian sense. To this end, we propose a very simple and efficient approach that perturbs an appropriate subset of model parameters, or equivalently hidden unit activations, during sampling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a wide range of datasets and model architectures.</description>
