      <title>Large area monocrystalline and surfactant-free copper microflake synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper is one of the most extensively studied materials for energy conversion and catalytic systems, with a wide range of other applications from nanophotonics to biotechnology. However, existing synthesis methods are limited with many undesirable by-products and poorly defined morphologies. Here, we report a surfactant-free on-substrate wet synthesis approach that yields monocrystalline metallic Cu microflakes with (111) crystalline exposed surface. By systematically studying the growth mechanism, we achieve unprecedented sizes of more than 130 {\mu}m, which is two orders of magnitude larger than reported in most previous studies, along with higher aspect ratios of over 400. Furthermore, we show distinctly higher stability against oxidation provided by the halide adlayer. Overall, our facile synthesis approach delivers an exciting venue for the emerging fields of catalysis and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of Water Molecules on the Surface of Silica Nanoparticles -- Insights from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Relaxometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $^{1}$H spin-lattice nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation experiments have been performed for water dispersions of functionalized silica nanoparticles of diameters of 25 and 45 nm. The experiments have been performed in a broad frequency range spanning 3 orders of magnitude, from 10 kHz to 10 MHz, versus temperature, from 313 to 263 K. On the basis of the data, two-dimensional translation diffusion (diffusion close to the nanoparticle surface within a layer of the order of a few diameters of water molecules) has been revealed. The translational correlation times as well as the residence life times on the nanoparticle surface have been determined. It has turned out that the residence lifetime is temperature-independent and is on the order of 5 x 10$^{-6}$ s for the smaller nanoparticles and by about a factor of 3 longer for the larger ones. The translational correlation time for the case of 25 nm nanoparticles is also temperature-independent and yields about 6 x 10$^{-7}$ s, while for the dispersion of the larger nanoparticles, the correlation times changed from about 8 x 10$^{-7}$ s at 313 K to about 1.2 x 10$^{-6}$ s at 263 K. In addition to the quantitative characterization of the two-dimensional translation diffusion, correlation times associated with bound water molecules have been determined. The studies have also given insights into the population of the bound and diffusing water on the surface water fractions.</description>

      <title>Pyrochlore NaYbO2: A potential Quantum Spin Liquid Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for quantum spin liquids (QSL) and chemical doping in such materials to explore superconductivity have continuously attracted intense interest. Here, we report the discovery of a potential QSL candidate, pyrochlore-lattice beta-NaYbO2. Colorless and transparent NaYbO2 single crystals, layered alpha-NaYbO2 (~250 um on edge) and octahedral beta-NaYbO2 (~50 um on edge), were grown for the first time. Synchrotron X-ray single crystal diffraction unambiguously determined that the newfound beta-NaYbO2 belongs to the three-dimensional pyrochlore structure characterized by the R-3m space group, corroborated by synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and pair distribution function. Magnetic measurements revealed no long-range magnetic order or spin glass behavior down to 0.4 K with a low boundary spin frustration factor of 17.5, suggesting a potential QSL ground state. Under high magnetic fields, the potential QSL state was broken and spins order. Our findings reveal that NaYbO2 is a fertile playground for studying novel quantum states.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Superconducting and Topological Properties in Mg-Li Electrides at High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrides as a unique class of emerging materials exhibit fascinating properties and hold important significance for understanding the matter under extreme conditions, which is characterized by valence electrons localized into the interstitial space as quasi-atoms (ISQs). In this work, using crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, we identified seven stable phases of Mg-Li that are electride with novel electronic properties under high pressure. Among them, MgLi10 is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.22 eV; and Pm-3m MgLi is superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature of 22.8 K. The important role played by the localization degree of ISQ in the superconducting transition temperature of these electrides is revealed by systematic comparison of Mg-Li with other Li-rich electride superconductors. Furthermore, we proved that Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi also have distinct topological behavior with metallic surface states and the non-zero $Z_2$ invariant. The simultaneous coexistence of superconductivity, electronic band topology and electride property in the same structure of Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi demonstrates the feasibility of realizing multi-quantum phases in a single material, which will stimulate further research in these interdisciplinary fields.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced Structure Change and Anomalies in Thermodynamic Quantities and Transport Properties in Liquid Lithium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understand the nature of liquid structure and its evolution under different conditions is a major challenge in condensed physics and materials science. Here, we report a pressure-induced structure change spanning a wide pressure range in liquid-state lithium hydride (LiH) by first-principles molecular dynamic simulations. This behavior can be described as a continuous crossover from low pressure liquid with Li$^+$-H$^-$ duality symmetry to high pressure one with broken of duality symmetry. The thermodynamic quantities such as heat capacity and ionic transport properties such as diffusivity are also saliently impacted. It is important to stress that such behavior is firstly predicted for this category of materials, which is ubiquitous in universe as well as in industry applications. Lastly, a comprehensive high-pressure high-temperature phase diagram of LiH is constructed, which embodies rich physics in this previously-thought-simple ionic compound.</description>

      <title>First-principle based Floquet engineering of solids in the velocity gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a practical and accurate strategy to capture light-matter interactions using the Floquet formalism in the velocity gauge in combination with realistic first-principle models of solids. The velocity gauge, defined by the linear coupling to the vector potential, is a standard method to capture the light-matter interaction in solids. However, its use with first-principle models has been limited by the challenging fact that it requires a large number of bands for convergence and its incompatibility with non-local pseudopotential plane wave methods. To improve its convergence properties, we explicitly take into account the truncation of Hilbert space in the construction of the Floquet Hamiltonian in the velocity gauge. To avoid the incompatibility with the pseudopotentials, we base our computations on generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from first-principles through maximally-localized Wannier functions. We exemplify the approach by computing the optical absorption spectra of laser-dressed trans-polyacetylene chain using realistic electronic structure. We show that, by proceeding in this way, Floquet consideration involving the truncated Hilbert spaces reproduces the full basis calculations with only a few bands and with significantly reduced computation time. The strategy has been implemented in FloqticS, a general code for the Floquet engineering of the optical properties of materials. Overall, this work introduces a useful theoretical tool to realize Floquet engineering of realistic solids in the velocity gauge.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Mechanical Strain on Magnetic and Structural Properties of 2D Materials: A Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent flexibility of two dimensional materials allows for efficient manipulation of their physical properties through strain application, which is essential for the development of advanced nanoscale devices. This study aimed to understand the impact of mechanical strain on the magnetic properties of two dimensional materials using Monte Carlo simulations. The effects of several strain states on the magnetic properties were investigated using the Lennard Jones potential and bond length-dependent exchange interactions. The key parameters analyzed include the Lindemann coefficient, radial distribution function, and magnetization in relation to temperature and magnetic field. The results indicate that applying biaxial tensile strain generally reduces the critical temperature. In contrast, the biaxial compressive strain increased Tc within the elastic range, but decreased at higher strain levels. Both compressive and tensile strains significantly influence the ferromagnetic properties and structural ordering, as evidenced by magnetization hysteresis. Notably, pure shear strain did not induce disorder, leaving the magnetization unaffected. In addition, our findings suggest the potential of domain-formation mechanisms. This study provides comprehensive insights into the influence of mechanical strain on the magnetic behavior and structural integrity of 2D materials, offering valuable guidance for future research and advanced material design applications.</description>

      <title>From Entanglement to Bonds: Chemical Bonding Concepts from Quantum Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical bonding is a nonlocal phenomenon that binds atoms into molecules. Its ubiquitous presence in chemistry, however, stands in stark contrast to its ambiguous definition and the lack of a universal perspective for its understanding. In this work, we rationalize and characterize chemical bonding through the lens of an equally nonlocal concept from quantum information, the orbital entanglement. We introduce maximally entangled atomic orbitals (MEAOs) whose entanglement pattern is shown to recover both Lewis (two-center) and beyond-Lewis (multicenter) structures, with multipartite entanglement serving as a comprehensive index of bond strength. Our unifying framework for bonding analyses is effective not only for equilibrium geometries but also for transition states in chemical reactions and complex phenomena such as aromaticity. It also has the potential to elevate the Hilbert space atomic partitioning to match the prevalent real-space partitioning in the theory of atoms in molecules. Accordingly, our work opens new pathways for understanding fuzzy chemical concepts using rigorous, quantitative descriptors from quantum information.</description>

      <title>Environment-limited transfer of angular momentum in Bose liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impurity motion in a many-body environment has been a central issue in the field of low-temperature physics for decades. In bosonic quantum fluids, the onset of a drag force experienced by point-like objects is due to collective environment excitations, driven by the exchange of linear momentum between the impurity and the many-body bath. In this work we consider a rotating impurity, with the aim of exploring how angular momentum is exchanged with the surrounding bosonic environment. In order to elucidate this issues, we employ a quasiparticle approach based on the angulon theory, which allows us to effectively deal with the non-trivial algebra of quantized angular momentum in presence of a many-body environment. We uncover how impurity dressing by environmental excitations can establish an exchange channel, whose effectiveness crucially depends on the initial state of the impurity. Remarkably, we find that there is a critical value of initial angular momentum, above which this channel effectively freezes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Prediction of NMR Parameters and geometry in 133Cs-containing compounds using Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The need to immobilize low-level nuclear waste, in particular 137Cs-bearing waste, has led to a growing interest in geopolymer-based waste matrices, in addition to optimization attempts of cement matrix compositions for this specific application. Although the overall phase composition and structure of these matrices are well characterized, the binding sites of Cs in these materials have not been clearly identified. Recent studies have suggested that combining the sensitivity of solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) to the local atomic structure with other structural techniques provides insights into the mode of Cs binding and release. Density Functional Theory (DFT) can provide the connection between spectroscopic parameters and geometric properties. However, the reliability of DFT results strongly relies on the choice of a suitable exchange-correlation functional, which for 133Cs, the NMR surrogate for such studies, is not well-established. In this work we benchmark various functionals against their performance in predicting the geometry of various simple Cs compounds, their NMR quadrupolar coupling constants, and their chemical shift values, while prioritizing the ability to incorporate dispersion interactions and maintaining low computational cost. We examined Cs salts, Cs oxides, perovskites, caged materials, a borate glass and a cesium fluoroscandate. While no single functional performs equally well for all parameters, the results show rev-vdW-DF2 and PBEsol+D3 to be leading candidates for these systems, in particular with respect to geometry and chemical shifts, which are of high importance for Cs-immobilization matrices.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum many-body description of superconducting trends in the cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a systematic ab initio quantum many-body approach that goes beyond low-energy models, we directly compute the superconducting pairing order and estimate the pairing gap of several doped cuprate materials and structures within a purely electronic picture. We find that we can correctly capture two well-known trends: the pressure effect, where the pairing order and gap increase with intra-layer pressure, and the layer effect, where the pairing order and gap vary with the number of copper-oxygen layers. From these calculations, we observe that the strength of superexchange and the covalency at optimal doping are the best descriptors for these trends. Our microscopic analysis further identifies that strong short-range spin fluctuations and multi-orbital charge fluctuations drive the development of the pairing order. Our work illustrates the possibility of a material-specific ab initio understanding of unconventional high-temperature superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Probing molecular photophysics in a matter-wave interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that matter-wave diffraction off a single standing laser wave can be used as an accurate measurement scheme for photophysical molecular parameters. These include state-dependent optical polarizabilities and photon-absorption cross sections, the relaxation rates for fluorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing, as well as ionization or cleavage probabilities. We discuss how the different photophysical processes manifest as features of the interference pattern, and we determine the accuracy of molecular parameters estimated from a realistic measurement with finite particle numbers. The analysis is based on an analytic calculation in Wigner representation, which accounts for the laser-induced coherent and incoherent dynamics, for the finite longitudinal and transverse coherence in the matter-wave beam, the gravitational and Coriolis acceleration, and an imperfect standing laser wave.</description>

      <title>Strong parity-violation effects induced by large-amplitude motions: A quantum-dynamics study of substituted chiral methanols</title>

Abstract: An enhanced mechanism is proposed for the large-amplitude-motion-induced parity-violating frequency by integrating the exact quantum dynamics method with the relativistic electronic structure theory. The torsional wavefunctions and PV frequency shifts are obtained by the exact quantum dynamics method. The potential energy curve and PV energy along the torsional coordinates are calculated using the extended atomic mean-field two-component Hamiltonian. The predicted PV frequency shift for the torsional transition of CFClBrOH is approximately 100 times larger than that of the conventional C-F stretching mode of CHFClBr. The maximum PV frequency shift (3.1 Hz) is obtained in the CHBrIOH molecule.</description>

      <title>A fluorescent-protein spin qubit</title>

Abstract: Optically-addressable spin qubits form the foundation of a new generation of emerging nanoscale sensors. The engineering of these sensors has mainly focused on solid-state systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. However, NVs are restricted in their ability to interface with biomolecules due to their bulky diamond host. Meanwhile, fluorescent proteins have become the gold standard in bioimaging, as they are genetically encodable and easily integrated with biomolecules. While fluorescent proteins have been suggested to possess a metastable triplet state, they have not been investigated as qubit sensors. Here, we realize an optically-addressable spin qubit in the Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) enabled by a novel spin-readout technique. A near-infrared laser pulse allows for triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 44% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the EYFP spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a spin-lattice relaxation time of $(141 \pm 5)\, \mathrm{\mu s}$, a $(16 \pm 2)\, \mathrm{\mu s}$ coherence time under Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) decoupling, and a predicted oscillating (AC) magnetic field sensitivity with an upper bound of $183 \, \mathrm{fT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically-detected magnetic resonance at room temperature in aqueous solution with contrast up to 3%, and measure a static (DC) field sensitivity with an upper bound of $93 \, \mathrm{pT}\, \mathrm{mol}^{1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Our results establish fluorescent proteins as a powerful new qubit sensor platform and pave the way for applications in the life sciences that are out of reach for solid-state technologies.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Time irreversibility in systems observed at coarse resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.</description>
