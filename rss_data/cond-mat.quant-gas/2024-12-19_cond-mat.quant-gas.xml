      <title>The SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard Model on two sites: Bethe Ansatz solution and Quantum Phase Transition of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model in the large-N limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on two sites, where N is the number of flavors of each fermion, corresponds to an exactly solvable two-level many-boson model that R.W. Richardson analytically solved long time ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the physical parameters of the SU(N) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and eigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. %In this framework the so-called exponential complexity of the system, whose total Hilbert space dimension scales as $4^N$, collapses, leaving In this context, the connection with the well studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves as a guideline to the prediction of some N-body physics phenomena in the two-sites SU(N) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second order Quantum Phase Transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ FHM for an attractive density density interaction U equal to $U_c=-1/(2N)$, in units of the (absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the finite size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy which all reveal the transition, as a function of U for values of N from N=3 to N=36, suggesting that the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies involving SU(N) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement entropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like $N$ at the transition, in contrast with several two-modes models.</description>

      <title>Probing supersolidity through excitations in a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates are a flexible experimental platform to engineer synthetic quantum many-body systems. In particular, they host the so-called stripe phase, an instance of a supersolid state of matter. The peculiar excitation spectrum of the stripe phase, a definite footprint of its supersolidity, has so far remained out of experimental reach. We achieve in situ imaging of the stripes and directly observe both superfluid and crystal excitations. We investigate superfluid hydrodynamics and reveal a stripe compression mode, thus demonstrating that the system possesses a compressible crystalline structure. Through the frequency softening of this mode, we locate the supersolid transition point. Our results establish spin-orbit-coupled supersolids as a platform of choice to investigate supersolidity and its rich dynamics.</description>

      <title>Double sine-Gordon class of universal coarsening dynamics in a spin-1 Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, universal dynamics prevails in many different situations, from pattern coarsening to turbulence, while the understanding of its microscopic laws and classification has remained unsatisfactory. Here, universal scaling evolution reflected by coarsening in a multi-component Bose gas is traced back to a low-energy effective theory given by a double sine-Gordon (DSG) model for a single real scalar field. Our experimental observations of a rubidium spinor BEC support the applicability of this model. Evaluating the scaling evolution according to the low-energy effective model demonstrates the universal aspects of the scaling characteristics as compared with that of the spinor gas. The difference between diffusion-type and sub-diffusive scaling is shown to be connected to the occupation of minima within the DSG potential. Our results point to a path towards a microscopic description and classification of pattern coarsening in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Determining the $^3$P$_0$ excited-state tune-out wavelength of $^{174}$Yb in a triple-magic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise state-dependent control of optical potentials is of great importance for various applications utilizing cold neutral atoms. In particular, tune-out wavelengths for the clock state pair in alkaline-earth(-like) atoms provide maximally state-selective trap conditions that hold promise for the realization of novel approaches in quantum computation and simulation. While several ground-state tune-out wavelengths have been determined, similar experimental studies for metastable excited states are challenged by inelastic collisions and Raman losses, so far prohibiting precise measurements of excited-state tune-out conditions. In this work we report on the measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the metastable $^3$P$_0$ clock state in $^{174}$Yb at $519.920(9)\,$THz. In order to circumvent collisional losses, we isolate individual $^3$P$_0$ atoms in a clock-magic-wavelength lattice at $759\,$nm. To minimize the limitation imposed by Raman scattering, we further implement resolved sideband cooling on the clock transition, which allows us to reduce the lattice depth and surpass lifetimes of $5\,$s. The precision of the tune-out measurement is further enhanced by fluorescence imaging in a triple-magic configuration, where we implement molasses cooling on the $^3$P$_1$ intercombination line and identify a magic angle of $38.5(9)^\circ$ in the clock-magic lattice.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Science-Ready Triel Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of atoms from Main Group III (Group 13) of the Periodic Table, also known as "triel elements," have great potential for a new generation of quantum matter experiments. The first magneto-optical trap of a triel element (indium) was recently realized, but more progress is needed before a triel is ready for modern quantum science experiments. Cutting edge quantum science can be performed with atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level or below, prepared in pure quantum states, and optically trapped. Here we report the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium. First, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK. Second, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the $5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we confine indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime. With these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum research platform.</description>

      <title>Momentum space magic for the transverse field quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizer entropies and quantum magic have been extensively explored in real-space formulations of quantum systems within the framework of resource theory. However, interesting and transparent physics often emerges in momentum space, such as Cooper pairing. Motivated by this, we investigate the momentum-space structure of Pauli strings and stabilizer entropies in the one-dimensional transverse-field quantum Ising model. By mapping the Ising chain onto momentum-space qubits, where the stabilizer state corresponds to the paramagnetic state, we analyze the evolution of the Pauli string distribution. In the ferromagnetic phase, the distribution is broad, whereas in the paramagnetic phase, it develops a two-peaked structure. We demonstrate that all ferromagnetic states possess the same degree of magic in the thermodynamic limit, while stabilizer entropies are non-analytic at the critical point and vanish with increasing transverse field. The momentum-space approach to quantum magic not only complements its real-space counterpart but also provides advantages in terms of analyzing nonstabilizerness and classical simulability.</description>

      <title>Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>

      <title>Floquet-driven crossover from density-assisted tunneling to enhanced pair tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the experimental control of pair tunneling in a double-well potential using Floquet engineering. We demonstrate a crossover from a regime with density-assisted tunneling to dominant pair tunneling by tuning the effective interactions. Furthermore, we show that the pair tunneling rate can be enhanced not only compared to the Floquet-reduced single-particle tunneling but even beyond the static superexchange rate, while keeping the effective interaction in a relevant range. This opens possibilities to realize models with explicit pair tunneling in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically host robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$, the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems, we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of bosonic modes. We analitycally solve for the eigenstates of this interacting impurity model by means of a novel polaron-type canonical transformation, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$ (with $d$ = spatial dimension of the lattice). Our theory unveils the stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts instances of its breakdown, e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence of heating under periodic driving for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;d$, beyond existing Floquet-prethermalization theorems.</description>

      <title>Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas in the Random Phase Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02706v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting fermions on the three-dimensional torus in the mean-field scaling limit. Our objective is computing the occupation number of the Fourier modes in a trial state obtained through the random phase approximation for the ground state. Our result shows that -- in the trial state -- the momentum distribution has a jump discontinuity, i. e., the system has a well-defined Fermi surface. Moreover the Fermi momentum does not depend on the interaction potential (it is universal).</description>
