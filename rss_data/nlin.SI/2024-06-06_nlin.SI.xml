      <title>Fokas-Lenells Derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation its associated soliton surfaces and Gaussian curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important tasks in mathematics and physics is to connect differential geometry and nonlinear differential equations. In the study of nonlinear optics, integrable nonlinear differential equations such as the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) and higher-order NLSE (HNLSE) play crucial roles. Because of the medium's balance between dispersion and nonlinearity, all of these systems display soliton solutions. The soliton surfaces, or manifolds, connected to these integrable systems hold significance in numerous areas of mathematics and physics. We examine the use of soliton theory in differential geometry in this paper. We build the two-dimensional soliton surface in the three-dimensional Euclidean space by taking into account the Fokas-Lenells Derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (also known as the gauged Fokas-Lenells equation). The same is constructed by us using the Sym-Tafel formula. The first and second fundamental forms, surface area, and Gaussian curvature are obtained using a Lax representation of the gauged FLE.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries of Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the number of relevant considerations in the literature, the algebra of generalized symmetries of the Burgers equation has not been exhaustively described. We fill this gap, presenting a basis of this algebra in an explicit form and proving that the two well-known recursion operators of the Burgers equation and two seed generalized symmetries, which are evolution forms of its Lie symmetries, suffice to generate this algebra. The core of the proof is essentially simplified by using the original technique of choosing special coordinates in the associated jet space.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of soliton lengths in a multicolor box-ball system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.04458v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The box-ball systems are integrable cellular automata whose long-time behavior is characterized by soliton solutions, with rich connections to other integrable systems such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In this paper, we consider a multicolor box-ball system with two types of random initial configurations and obtain sharp scaling limits of the soliton lengths as the system size tends to infinity. We obtain a sharp scaling limit of soliton lengths that turns out to be more delicate than that in the single color case established in [Levine, Lyu, Pike '20]. A large part of our analysis is devoted to studying the associated carrier process, which is a multi-dimensional Markov chain on the orthant, whose excursions and running maxima are closely related to soliton lengths. We establish the sharp scaling of its ruin probabilities, Skorokhod decomposition, strong law of large numbers, and weak diffusive scaling limit to a semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion with explicit parameters. We also establish and utilize complementary descriptions of the soliton lengths and numbers in terms of modified Greene-Kleitman invariants for the box-ball systems and associated circular exclusion processes.</description>
