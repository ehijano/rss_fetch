      <title>Image-Constrained Modeling with Hubble and Keck Images Reveals that OGLE-2012-BLG-0563Lb is a Jupiter-Mass planet Orbiting a K Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution imaging from the {\sl Hubble Space Telescope} combined with adaptive optics imaging results from the {\sl Keck}-II telescope to determine the mass of the OGLE-2012-BLG-0563L host star and planet to be $M_{\rm host} = 0.801\pm 0.033M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm planet} = 1.116 \pm 0.087 M_{\rm Jupiter}$, respectively, located at a distance of $D_L = 5.46\pm 0.56\,$kpc. There is a close-wide degeneracy in the light curve models that indicates star-planet projected separation of $1.50\pm 0.16\,$AU for the close model and $8.41\pm 0.87\,$AU for the wide model. We used the image-constrained modeling method to analyze the light curve data with constraints from this high angular resolution image analysis. This revealed systematic errors in some of the ground-based light curve photometry that led to an estimate of the angular Einstein Radius, $\theta_E$, that was too large by a factor of $\sim 2$. The host star mass is a factor of 2.4 larger than the value presented in the \citet{fukui15} discovery paper. Although most systematic photometry errors seen in ground-based microlensing light curve photometry will not be repeated in data from the {\sl Roman Space Telescope}'s Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey, we argue that image constrained modeling will be a valuable method to identify possible systematic errors in {\sl Roman} photometry.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: A Precise Water Abundance for Hot Jupiter WASP-17b from the NIRISS SOSS Transmission Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water has proven to be ubiquitously detected in near-infrared (NIR) transmission spectroscopy observations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, including WASP-17b. However, previous analyses of WASP-17b's atmosphere based upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer data could not constrain the water abundance, finding that sub-solar, super-solar and bimodal posterior distributions were all statistically valid. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b using JWST's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (NIRISS SOSS) mode. We analyze our data using three independent data analysis pipelines, finding excellent agreement between results. Our transmission spectrum shows multiple H$_2$O absorption features and a flatter slope towards the optical than seen in previous HST observations. We analyze our spectrum using both PICASO+Virga forward models and free retrievals. POSEIDON retrievals provide a well-constrained super-solar $\log$(H$_2$O) abundance (-2.96$^{+0.31}_{-0.24}$), breaking the degeneracy from the previous HST/Spitzer analysis. We verify our POSEIDON results with petitRADTRANS retrievals. Additionally, we constrain the abundance of $\log$(H$^-$), -10.19$^{+0.30}_{-0.23}$, finding that our model including H$^-$ is preferred over our model without H$^-$ to 5.1 $\sigma$. Furthermore, we constrain the $\log$(K) abundance (-8.07$^{+0.58}_{-0.52}$) in WASP-17b's atmosphere for the first time using space-based observations. Our abundance constraints demonstrate the power of NIRISS SOSS's increased resolution, precision, and wavelength range to improve upon previous NIR space-based results. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).</description>

      <title>A Global Perspective with Updated Constraints on the Ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-19b: Atmospheric Properties and Stellar Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed reanalysis of the atmospheric properties of WASP-19b, an ultra-hot Jupiter (1.14 M Jup, 1.41 R Jup) orbiting an active Sun-like star every 0.79 day. We reanalyze a transit and secondary eclipse of WASP-19b observed by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 spectrograph (1.1 - 1.7 microns). When combined with Spitzer photometry at longer wavelengths, our analyses indicate the presence of water absorption features in both the planet's transmission and emission spectra, consistent with results from previously published studies. We jointly fit WASP-19b's dayside emission and transmission spectra with a retrieval model in order to constrain its atmospheric composition, and explore the effect of stellar activity on its transmission spectrum in greater depth. We also compare our dayside emission spectrum to predictions from a general circulation model, and conclude that magnetic drag appears to be relatively unimportant in shaping WASP-19b's atmospheric circulation. Lastly, we compare the size of WASP-19b's dayside water absorption feature to the population of hot Jupiters with similar measurements, and show that it is located in the transitional irradiation regime where temperature inversions first begin to emerge. As in previous studies, we find that the current observations provide relatively weak constraints on this planet's atmospheric properties. These constraints could be significantly improved by the addition of spectroscopically resolved observations at longer wavelengths with JWST/NIRSpec PRISM.</description>

      <title>Predictions of Dust Continuum Emission from a Potential Circumplanetary Disk: A Case Study of the Planet Candidate AB Aurigae b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas accreting planets embedded in protoplanetary disks are expected to show dust thermal emission from their circumplanetary disks (CPDs). However, a recently reported gas accreting planet candidate, AB Aurigae b, has not been detected in (sub)millimeter continuum observations. We calculate the evolution of dust in the potential CPD of AB Aurigae b and predict its thermal emission at 1.3 mm wavelength as a case study, where the obtained features may also be applied to other gas accreting planets. We find that the expected flux density from the CPD is lower than the 3-sigma level of the previous continuum observation by ALMA with broad ranges of parameters, consistent with the non-detection. However, the expected planet mass and gas accretion rate are higher if the reduction of the observed near-infrared continuum and H-alpha line emission due to the extinction by small grains is considered, resulting in higher flux density of the dust emission from the CPD at (sub)millimeter wavelength. We find that the corrected predictions of the dust emission are stronger than the 3-sigma level of the previous observation with the typical dust-to-gas mass ratio of the inflow to the CPD. This result suggests that the dust supply to the vicinity of AB Aurigae b is small if the planet candidate is not the scattered light of the star but is a planet and has a CPD. Future continuum observations at shorter wavelength are preferable to obtain more robust clues to the question whether the candidate is a planet or not.</description>

      <title>Electron-Induced Radiolysis of Water Ice and the Buildup of Oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irradiation by energetic ions, electrons, and UV photons induces sputtering and chemical processes (radiolysis) in the surfaces of icy moons, comets, and icy grains. Laboratory experiments, both of ideal surfaces and of more complex and realistic analog samples, are crucial to understand the interaction of surfaces of icy moons and comets with their space environment. This study shows the first results of mass spectrometry measurements from porous water ice regolith samples irradiated with electrons as a representative analogy to water-ice rich surfaces in the solar system. Previous studies have shown that most electron-induced H2O radiolysis products leave the ice as H2 and O2 and that O2 can be trapped under certain conditions in the irradiated ice. Our new laboratory experiments confirm these findings. Moreover, they quantify residence times and saturation levels of O2 in originally pure water ice. H2O may also be released from the water ice by irradiation, but the quantification of the released H2O is more difficult and the total amount is sensitive to the electron flux and energy.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Rotational State and Shape of Asteroid (203) Pompeja from TESS Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Main Belt asteroid (203) Pompeja shows evidence of extreme variability in visible and near-infrared spectral slope with time. The observed spectral variability has been hypothesized to be attributed to spatial variations across Pompeja's surface. In this scenario, the observed spectrum of Pompeja is dependent on the geometry of the Sun and the observer relative to the asteroid's spin pole and surface features. Knowledge of the rotational spin pole and shape can be gleaned from light curves and photometric measurements. However, dense light curves of Pompeja are only available from two apparitions. Further, previous estimates of Pompeja's sidereal period are close to being Earth-commensurate, making ground-based light curves difficult to obtain. To overcome these difficulties, we implement a pipeline to extract a dense light curve of Pompeja from cutouts of TESS Full Frame Images. We succeeded in obtaining a dense light curve of Pompeja covering $\sim$22 complete rotations. We measure a synodic period of $P_{syn} =24.092 \pm 0.005$ hours and amplitude of 0.073 $\pm$ 0.002 magnitudes during Pompeja's 2021 apparition in the TESS field of view. We use this light curve to refine models of Pompeja's shape and spin pole orientation, yielding two spin pole solutions with sidereal periods and spin pole ecliptic coordinates of $P_{\mathrm{sid}, 1} = 24.0485 \pm 0.0001$ hours, $\lambda_1 = 132^{\circ}$, $\beta_1 = +41^{\circ}$ and $P_{\mathrm{sid}, 2} = 24.0484 \pm 0.0001$ hours, $\lambda_2 =307^{\circ}$, $\beta_2 =+34^{\circ}$. Finally, we discuss the implications of the derived shape and spin models for spectral variability on Pompeja.</description>

      <title>Deep imaging of three accelerating stars using SHARK-NIR and LMIRCam at LBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of detection techniques enhances our ability to identify companions orbiting nearby stars. We employed high-contrast imaging to constrain mass and separation of possible companions responsible for the significant proper motion anomalies of the nearby stars HIP 11696, HIP 47110 and HIP 36277. These targets were observed using the LBT's high-contrast camera, SHARK-NIR, in H-band using a Gaussian coronagraph, and with the LMIRCam instrument in the L'-band and using a vAPP coronagraph. Both observations were conducted simultaneously. Additionally, constraints at short separations from the host star are derived analyzing the renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) values from the Gaia catalogue. We find that the companion responsible for the anomaly signal of HIP 11696 is likely positioned at a distance from 2.5 to 28 astronomical units from its host. Its mass is estimated to be between 4 and 16 Jupiter masses, with the greater mass possible only at the upper end of the separation range. Similar limits were obtained for HIP 47110 where the companion should reside between 3 and 30 au with a mass between 3 and 10 MJup. For HIP 36277, we identified a faint stellar companion at large separation, though it might be substellar depending on the assumed age for the star. Considering the older age, this object accounts for the absolute value of the PMa vector but not for its direction. Additionally, we found a substellar candidate companion at a closer separation that could explain the PMa signal, considering a younger age for the system.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric conductances at the giant planets of the Solar System:a comparative study of ionization sources and the impact of meteoric ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of giant planet magnetospheres is controlled by a complex interplay between their fast rotation, their interaction with the solar wind, and their diverse internal plasma and momentum sources. In the ionosphere, the Hall and Pedersen conductances are two key parameters that regulate the intensity of currents coupling the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, and the rate of angular momentum transfer and power carried by these currents. We perform a comparative study of Hall and Pedersen conductivities and conductances in the four giant planets of our Solar System - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. We use a generic ionospheric model (restraining the studied ions to H3+, CH5+, and meteoric ions) to study the dependence of conductances on the structure and composition of these planets' upper atmospheres and on the main ionization sources (photoionization, ionization by precipitating electrons, and meteoroid ablation). After checking that our model reproduces the conclusions of Nakamura et al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JA030312) at Jupiter, i.e. the contribution of meteoric ions to the height-integrated conductances is non-negligible, we show that this contribution could also be non-negligible at Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, compared with ionization processes caused by precipitating electrons of energies lower than a few keV (typical energies on these planets). However, because of their weaker magnetic field, the conductive layer of these planets is higher than the layer where meteoric ions are mainly produced, limiting their role in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.</description>

      <title>No evidence of magma ocean on Io based on Juno/JIRAM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper (ref. 1) used infrared images of Io acquired by the Juno/JIRAM instrument to derive a latitudinal dependence of the spectral radiance and conclude that such latitudinal dependence is consistent with a magma ocean model. We challenge their conclusions, and we draw attention to some potential issues with their analysis. In this letter, we will use three arguments to show that: (1) the (ref. 1) paper uses saturated data; (2) the M-filter of the JIRAM imager is only a weak and incomplete proxy for the total power output; and finally (3) even assuming that the radiance was correctly estimated, the latitudinal dependence of the 4.8-$\mu$m spectral radiance is not statistically significant. These facts, taken together, demonstrate that the results presented in (ref. 1) are not sufficient to confirm consistency with a magma ocean model on Io.</description>

      <title>The GAPS programme at TNG XLVI. A homogeneous search for Na i and its possible variability in ten gas giant exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutral sodium resonance doublet (Na i D) has been detected in the upper atmosphere of several close-in gas giants, through high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We aim to investigate whether its variability is linked to the planets' properties, the data quality, or the accuracy of the system parameters used.
  Using the public code SLOPpy, we extracted the transmission spectrum in the Na i D region of ten gas giants for which a large number of HARPS-N observations are available. We modelled the absorption signals found, performing an MCMC analysis, and converted the measured absorption depth to the corresponding atmospheric height over which most sodium absorption occurs.
  While two targets (GJ 436 b and KELT-7 b) show no Na i D feature, we found variability in the transmission spectrum of the other targets. Three of them (HD 209458 b, WASP-80 b, and WASP-127 b) present absorption on only some nights, while in the other five targets (HD 189733 b, KELT-9 b, KELT-20 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-76 b), a significant absorption signal is present on most of the nights analysed. Except for WASP-69 b, the measured absorption depths lead to a ratio of the two Na I D depths that is compatible with or slightly larger than one.
  As was expected from literature, the relative atmospheric height follows an empirical exponential trend as a function of a scaled product of the planet's equilibrium temperature and surface gravity.
  We confirm the sodium detection on HD 189733 b, KELT-9 b, KELT-20 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-76 b. The signal detected in WASP-127 b requires further observations for definitive confirmation. We exclude a planetary origin for the signals found on HD 209458 b and WASP-80 b. The sodium absorption variability does not appear to be related to planetary properties, but rather to data quality, sub-optimal data treatment, or stellar activity.</description>

Abstract: We examine images of the protoplanetary disk 114--426 with JWST/NIRCam in 12 bands. This large disk is oriented edge-on with a dark midplane flanked by lobes of scattered light. The outer edges of the midplane are seen in silhouette against the Orion Nebula, providing a unique opportunity to study planet-forming material in absorption. We discover a dip in the scattered light of the disk at 3\,$\micron$ -- compelling evidence for the presence of water ice. The 3\,$\micron$ dip is also seen in the silhouette of the disk, where we quantify the ice abundance with models of pure absorption and avoid the complications of disk scattering effects. We find grain ice-to-refractory mass ratios of up to $\sim$0.2, maximum grain sizes of 0.25 to 5\,$\micron$, and a total dust plus ice mass of 0.46\,$M_\oplus$ in the silhouette region. We also discover excess absorption in the NIRCam bands that include the Paschen $\alpha$ line, suggesting there may be excited atomic hydrogen in the disk. Examining the morphology of the scattered light lobes reveals that they are laterally offset from each other and exhibit a brightness asymmetry that flips with wavelength -- both evidence for a tilted inner disk in this system.</description>

      <title>DARWEN: Data-driven Algorithm for Reduction of Wide Exoplanetary Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet atmospheric modeling is advancing from chemically diverse one-dimensional (1D) models to three-dimensional (3D) global circulation models (GCMs), which are crucial for interpreting observations from facilities like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). However, maintaining chemical diversity in models, especially in GCMs, is computationally expensive, limiting their complexity. Optimizing the number of reactions and species can address this tradeoff, but transparent and efficient methods for such optimization are lacking in current exoplanet literature. We aim to develop a systematic approach for reducing chemical networks in exoplanetary atmospheres while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our data-driven method selects optimal reduced chemical networks based on accuracy and computational efficiency metrics. This approach can optimize networks for similar planets simultaneously, assign weights to prioritize accuracy or efficiency, and is applicable when including photochemistry. We base our method on sensitivity analysis of a typical 1D chemical kinetics model, applying principal component analysis to the sensitivities. To achieve fast and reliable network reduction, we utilize a genetic algorithm, a machine-learning optimization method that mimics natural selection. We present three schemes tailored for different priorities (accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to photochemistry) that demonstrate improved performance and reduced computational costs. Our genetic algorithm-based method, the first to reduce a chemical network including photochemistry in exoplanet research, offers a versatile and efficient approach to enhance both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>From Misaligned Sub-Saturns to Aligned Brown Dwarfs: The Highest $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ Systems Exhibit Low Obliquities, Even around Hot Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pattern emerging from stellar obliquity measurements in single-star systems: planets with high planet-to-star mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&gt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$) -- such as super-Jupiters, brown dwarf companions, and M-dwarfs hosting Jupiter-like planets -- tend to be aligned, even around hot stars. This alignment represents a 3.7$\sigma$ deviation from the obliquity distribution observed in systems with lower mass ratios ($M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$&lt;$ $2\times10^{-3}$), which predominantly include Jupiters and sub-Saturns. The only known outlier system, XO-3, exhibits misalignment confirmed via our newly collected Rossiter-McLaughlin effect measurement ($\lambda=41.8^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ degrees). However, the relatively large $\textit{Gaia}$ Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE) of XO-3 suggests that it may harbor an undetected binary companion, potentially contributing to its misalignment. Given that tidal realignment mechanisms are weak for hot stars, the observed alignment in high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems is likely $\textit{primordial}$ rather than resulting from tidal interactions. One possible explanation is that only dynamically isolated planets can continue accreting gas and evolve into super-Jupiters while maintaining their primordial alignment. Conversely, planets formed in compact configurations may be unable to grow beyond the gap-opening mass, for which our work suggests an empirical boundary $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$$=$ $2\times10^{-3}$, identified between aligned high $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems and misaligned low $M_{\rm p}/M{_*}$ systems, with dynamical instabilities contributing to the diverse spin-orbit misalignments observed in the latter.</description>

      <title>Using the Difference of the Inclinations of a Pair of Counter-Orbiting Satellites to Measure the Lense-Thirring Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let two test particles A and B revolving about a spinning primary along ideally identical orbits in opposite directions be considered. From the general expressions of the precessions of the orbital inclination induced by the post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic and Newtonian quadrupolar fields of the central object, it turns out that the Lense-Thirring inclination rates of A and B are equal and opposite, while the Newtonian ones due to the primary's oblateness are identical. Thus, the difference of the inclination shifts of the two orbiters would allow, in principle, to cancel out the classical effects by enhancing the general relativistic ones. The conditions affecting the orbital configurations that must be satisfied for this to occur and possible observable consequences in the field of Earth are investigated. In particular, a scenario involving two spacecraft in polar orbits, branded POLAr RElativity Satellites (POLARES) and reminiscent of an earlier proposal by Van Patten and Everitt in the mid-1970s, is considered. A comparison with the ongoing experiment with the LAser GEOdynamics Satellite (LAGEOS) and LAser RElativity Satellite (LARES) 2 is made.</description>

      <title>Modeling the astrosphere of LHS~1140</title>

Abstract: The cosmic ray (CR) flux, as well as the hydrogen flux into the atmosphere of an exoplanet, can change the composition of the atmosphere. Here, we present the CR and hydrogen flux on top of the atmosphere. To do so, we have to study the 3D multifluid MHD structure of astrospheres. We discuss the shock structure of the stellar wind of LHS 1140 using four different models: HD and MHD single-fluid models, as well as multifluid models for both cases, including a neutral hydrogen flow from the interstellar medium. The CR flux in a multifluid model as well as the ionization rate in an exoplanetary atmosphere are also presented. The astrosphere is modeled using the 3D Cronos code, while the CR flux at LHS 1140 b is calculated using both a 1D and a 3D stochastic galactic CR modulation code. Finally, the atmospheric ionization and radiation dose is estimated using the AtRIS code. Results. It is shown that the 3D multifluid positions of the termination shock differ remarkably from those found in the 3D ideal-single fluid hydrodynamic case. CR fluxes computed using a 1D approach are completely different from those calculated using the 3D modulation code and show an essentially unmodulated spectrum at the exoplanet in question. Utilizing these spectra, ionization rates and radiation exposure within the atmosphere of LHS 1140 b are derived. The termination shock, astropause, and bow shock distances must be taken from the 3D multifluid MHD model to determine the CR fluxes correctly. Moreover, because of the tiny astrosphere, the exoplanet is submerged in the neutral hydrogen flow of the interstellar medium, which will influence the exoplanetary atmosphere. A 3D approach to Galactic\0 cosmic ray (GCR) modulation in astrospheres is also necessary to avoid unrealistic estimates of GCR intensities.</description>

      <title>Investigating Kozai-Lidov Oscillations and Disc Tearing in Be Star Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent simulations of Be stars in misaligned binary systems have revealed that misalignment between the disc and binary orbit can cause the disc to undergo Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations or disc-tearing. We build on our previous suite of three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of equal-mass systems by simulating eight new misaligned Be star binary systems, with mass-ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, or equal-mass systems with varying viscosity. We find the same phenomena occur as previously for mass ratios of 0.5, while the mass ratio of 0.1 does not cause KL oscillations or disc-tearing for the parameters examined. With increased viscosity in our equal-mass simulations, we show that these phenomena and other oscillations are damped out and do not occur. We also briefly compare two viscosity prescriptions and find they can produce the same qualitative disc evolution. Next, we use the radiative transfer code HDUST to predict observable trends of a KL oscillation, and show how the observables oscillate in sync with disc inclination and cause large changes in the polarization position angle. Our models generate highly complex line profiles, including triple-peak profiles that are known to occur in Be stars. The mapping between the SPH simulations and these triple-peak features gives us hints as to where they originate. Finally, we construct interferometric predictions of how a gap in the disc, produced by KL oscillations or disc-tearing, perturbs the visibility versus baseline curve at multiple wavelengths, and can cause large changes to the differential phase profile across an emission line.</description>

      <title>Planet-Planet Scattering and ZLK Migration -- The Dynamical History of HAT-P-11</title>

Abstract: The two planets of the HAT-P-11 system represent fascinating dynamical puzzles due to their significant eccentricities and orbital misalignments. In particular, HAT-P-11 b is on a close-in orbit that tides should have circularized well within the age of the system. Here we propose a two-step dynamical process that can reproduce all intriguing aspects of the system. We first invoke planet-planet scattering to generate significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations between the planets. We then propose that this misalignment initiated von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles and high-eccentricity migration that ultimately brought HAT-P-11 b to its present-day orbit. We find that this scenario is fully consistent only when significant tidally-driven radius inflation is accounted for during the tidal migration. We present a suite of N-body simulations exploring each phase of evolution and show that this scenario is consistent with all observational posteriors and the reported age of the system.</description>

      <title>Self-sustaining living habitats in extraterrestrial environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard definitions of habitability assume that life requires the presence of planetary gravity wells to stabilize liquid water and regulate surface temperature. Here the consequences of relaxing this assumption are evaluated. Temperature, pressure, volatile loss, radiation levels and nutrient availability all appear to be surmountable obstacles to the survival of photosynthetic life in space or on celestial bodies with thin atmospheres. Biologically generated barriers capable of transmitting visible radiation, blocking ultraviolet, and sustaining temperature gradients of 25-100 K and pressure differences of 10 kPa against the vacuum of space can allow habitable conditions between 1 and 5 astronomical units in the solar system. Hence ecosystems capable of generating conditions for their own survival are physically plausible, given the known capabilities of biological materials on Earth. Biogenic habitats for photosynthetic life in extraterrestrial environments would have major benefits for human life support and sustainability in space. Because the evolution of life elsewhere may have followed very different pathways from on Earth, living habitats could also exist outside traditional habitable environments around other stars, where they would have unusual but potentially detectable biosignatures.</description>

      <title>Transiting Jupiters around M-dwarfs have similar masses to FGK warm-Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of the bulk properties (mass and radius) of transiting giant planets ($\gtrsim$ 8$R_{\oplus}$) orbiting FGKM stars. Our findings suggest that the average mass of M-dwarf Jupiters is lower than that of their solar-type counterparts, primarily due to the scarcity of super-Jupiters ( $\gtrsim$ 2 $M_J$) around M-dwarfs. However, when super-Jupiters are excluded from the analysis, we observe a striking similarity in the average masses of M-dwarf and FGK warm-Jupiters. We propose that these trends can be explained by a minimum disk dust mass threshold required for Jovian formation through core accretion, which is likely to be satisfied more often around higher mass stars. This simplistic explanation suggests that the disk mass has more of an influence on giant planet formation than other factors such as the host star mass, formation location, metallicity, radiation environment, etc., and also accounts for the lower occurrence of giant planets around M-dwarf stars. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an abrupt transition in the ratio of super-Jupiters to Jupiters around F-type stars at the Kraft break, which could be a product of $v$sin$i$ related detection biases, but requires additional data from an unbiased sample with published non-detections to confirm. Overall, our results provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of giant exoplanets across a diverse range of stellar environments.</description>
