      <title>Baryonic screening masses in QCD at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the baryonic screening masses with nucleon quantum numbers and its negative parity partner in thermal QCD with $N_f=3$ massless quarks for a wide range of temperatures, from $T \sim 1$ GeV up to $\sim 160$ GeV. The computation is performed by Monte Carlo simulations of lattice QCD with $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions by exploiting a recently proposed strategy to study non-perturbatively QCD at very high temperature. Very large spatial extensions are considered in order to have negligible finite volume effects. For each temperature we have simulated $3$ or $4$ values of the lattice spacing, so as to perform the continuum limit extrapolation with confidence at a few permille accuracy. The degeneracy of the positive and negative parity-state screening masses, expected from Ward identities associated to non-singlet axial transformations, provides further evidence for the restoration of chiral symmetry in the high temperature regime of QCD. In the entire range of temperatures explored, the baryonic masses deviate from the free theory result, $3 \pi T$, by $4$-$8\%$. The contribution due to the interactions is clearly visible up to the highest temperature considered, and cannot be explained by the expected leading behavior in the QCD coupling constant $g$ over the entire range of temperatures explored.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions from the pseudo-distribution approach on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) are key quantities for the description of a hadron's three-dimensional structure. They are the current focus of all areas of hadronic physics -- phenomenological, experimental, and theoretical, including lattice QCD. Synergies between these areas are desirable and essential to achieve precise quantification and understanding of the structure of, particularly nucleons, as the basic ingredients of matter. In this paper, we investigate, for the first time, the numerical implementation of the pseudo-distribution approach for the extraction of zero-skewness GPDs for unpolarized quarks. Pseudo-distributions are Euclidean parton correlators computable in lattice QCD that can be perturbatively matched to the light-cone parton distributions of interest. Being closely related to the quasi-distributions and coming from the same lattice-extracted matrix elements, they are, however, subject to different systematic effects. We use the data previously utilized for quasi-GPDs and extend it with other momentum transfers and nucleon boosts, in particular a higher one ($P_3=1.67$ GeV) with eight-fold larger statistics than the largest one used for quasi-distributions ($P_3=1.25$ GeV). We renormalize the matrix elements with a ratio scheme and match the resulting Ioffe time distributions to the light cone in coordinate space. The matched distributions are then used to reconstruct the $x$-dependence with a fitting ansatz.We investigate some systematic effects related to this procedure, and we also compare the results with the ones obtained in the framework of quasi-GPDs. Our final results involve the invariant four-momentum transfer squared ($-t$) dependence of the flavor non-singlet ($u-d$) $H$ and $E$ GPDs.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{D}$ and $\mathrm{D_s}$ decay constants in $N_{\rm f}=2+1$ QCD with Wilson fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the leptonic decay constants of the D and D$_{\rm s}$ mesons from $N_{\rm f}=2+1$ lattice QCD. We employ a set of 49 high statistics gauge ensembles generated by the Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS) effort utilising non-perturbatively improved Wilson fermions and the tree-level Symanzik improved gauge action at six values of the lattice spacing in the range $a = 0.098\,$fm down to $a = 0.039\,$fm, with pion masses varying from around $420\,$MeV down to below the physical point. The ensembles lie on three trajectories in the quark mass plane, two trajectories intersecting close to the physical quark mass point and the third one approaching the SU(3) chiral limit, enabling tight control of the light and strange quark mass dependence. We obtain $f_{\mathrm{D_s}}=246.8(1.3)\,$MeV, $f_\mathrm{D}=208.4(1.5)\,$MeV and $f_{\mathrm{D_s}}/f_\mathrm{D}=1.1842(36)$, where the precision of our results is mostly limited by the determination of the scale.</description>

      <title>Staggered bosons and Kahler-Dirac bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel way to think about bosonic lattice theories in Hamiltonian form where each lattice site has only a half boson degree of freedom. The construction requires a non-trivial Poisson bracket between neighboring sites and leads to gapless theories with non-invertible symmetries. We also describe a bosonic version of Kahler-Dirac fermions, dubbed Kahler-Dirac bosons that can be performed on any triangulation of a manifold. This also leads to a straightforward implementation of supersymmetry on the lattice and one immediately deduces the Dirac equation of the corresponding Kahler-Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Baryonic thermal screening mass at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the resummed 1-loop correction to a baryonic thermal screening mass. The calculation is carried out in the framework of a dimensionally reduced effective theory, where quarks are heavy fields due to their non-zero Matsubara frequencies. The correction due to interactions is computed at O($g^2_{ }$) in the coupling constant. In order to solve a 3-body Schr\"odinger equation, we exploit a two-dimensional generalization of the hyperspherical harmonics method. At electroweak scale temperatures, the NLO correction represents a $\sim 4.6 \%$ increase of the free-theory value $3\pi T$ of the screening mass.</description>

      <title>Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators in gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators are constructed using local operators connected by time-like or space-like Wilson lines, which ensure gauge invariance. Off-lightcone Wilson-line operators have broad applications in various contexts. For instance, space-like Wilson-line operators play a crucial role in determining quasi-distribution functions (quasi-PDFs), while time-like Wilson-line operators are essential for understanding quarkonium decay and production within the potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) framework. In this work, we establish a systematic approach for calculating the matching from the gradient-flow scheme to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme in the limit of small flow time for off-lightcone Wilson-line operators. By employing the one-dimensional auxiliary-field formalism, we simplify the matching procedure, reducing it to the matching of local current operators. We provide one-loop level matching coefficients for these local current operators. For the case of hadronic matrix element related to the quark quasi-PDFs, we show at one-loop level that the finite flow time effect is very small as long as the flow radius is smaller than the physical distance $z$, which is usually satisfied in lattice gradient flow computations. Applications include lattice gradient flow computations of quark/gluon quasi-PDFs, gluonic correlators related to quarkonium decay and production in pNRQCD, and spin-dependent potentials in terms of chromoelectric and chromomagnetic field insertions into a Wilson loop.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature in a model with manifest confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple lattice evidences support the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover at Tch ~ 155 MeV. This regime is characterised by an approximate chiral spin symmetry of the partition function, which is a symmetry of the colour charge and the confining electric part of the QCD Lagrangian. It is traditionally believed that confinement should automatically induce spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which would preclude the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD at high temperatures. We employ a well-known solvable quark model for QCD in 3+1 dimensions that is chirally symmetric and manifestly confining and argue that while confinement indeed induces dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, a chiral restoration phase transition takes place at some critical temperature Tch. Above this temperature, the spectrum of the model consists of chirally symmetric hadrons with approximate chiral spin symmetry.</description>
