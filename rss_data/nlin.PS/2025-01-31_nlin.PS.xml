      <title>Neural Network Modeling of Microstructure Complexity Using Digital Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microstructure evolution in matter is often modeled numerically using field or level-set solvers, mirroring the dual representation of spatiotemporal complexity in terms of pixel or voxel data, and geometrical forms in vector graphics. Motivated by this analog, as well as the structural and event-driven nature of artificial and spiking neural networks, respectively, we evaluate their performance in learning and predicting fatigue crack growth and Turing pattern development. Predictions are made based on digital libraries constructed from computer simulations, which can be replaced by experimental data to lift the mathematical overconstraints of physics. Our assessment suggests that the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model offers superior predictive accuracy with fewer parameters and less memory usage, alleviating the accuracy-cost tradeoff in contrast to the common practices in computer vision tasks. Examination of network architectures shows that these benefits arise from its reduced weight range and sparser connections. The study highlights the capability of event-driven models in tackling problems with evolutionary bulk-phase and interface behaviors using the digital library approach.</description>

      <title>Improving the mean-field approximation in continuous models of population dynamics with nonlocal dispersal: applications to vegetation pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spot patterns, in which vegetation patches form a hexagonal lattice, are frequent in nature and could serve as an early-warning indicator of abrupt vegetation collapses. Consequently, they have been intensively studied using both individual-based models and density-based field equations. Yet, the relationship between these two approaches remains unclear, particularly in scenarios where vegetation dynamics exhibit strong long-range spatial correlations and traditional mean-field approximations fail. To solve this issue, we develop a new method that refines mean-field approximations by describing both the dynamics of the biomass density field and its spatial correlations. This new approach harnesses the strengths of both individual and density-based models, treating spatial correlations explicitly and allowing for the identification of spatial instabilities resulting in periodic patterns. Our results indicate that this new approximation predicts the parameter regimes where regular periodic patterns emerge more accurately than mean-field models, suggesting that it could provide a more robust framework to perform further nonlinear analysis.</description>
