      <title>The Kohn-Luttinger Effect in Dense Matter and its Implications for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repulsive short-range interactions can induce p-wave attraction between fermions in dense matter and lead to Cooper pairing at the Fermi surface. We investigate this phenomenon, well-known as the Kohn-Luttinger effect in condensed matter physics, in dense matter with strong short-range repulsive interactions. We find that repulsive interactions required to stabilize massive neutron stars can induce p-wave pairing in neutron and quark matter. When massive vector bosons mediate the interaction between fermions, the induced interaction favors Cooper pairing in the 3P2 channel. For the typical strength of the interaction favored by massive neutron stars, the associated pairing gaps in neutrons can be in the range of 10 keV to 10 MeV. Strong and attractive spin-orbit and tensor forces between neutrons can result in repulsive induced interactions that greatly suppress the 3P2 pairing gap in neutron matter. In quark matter, the induced interaction is too small to result in pairing gaps of phenomenological relevance.</description>

      <title>Prompt fission neutron spectra of 240Pu(n, F)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variation of fission neutron spectra of 240Pu (sf) and 240Pu (n, F) for E up to 20 MeV predicted.Features of angle-integrated prompt fission neutron spectra of 240Pu (n, F) stem from simultaneous analysis of data for 238U (n, F), 239Pu (n, F) and available data on 240Pu (n, F) prompt fission neutron spectra.The data on average energies of 240Pu (n, F) prompt fission neutron spectra support the approach pursued in case of 238U (n, F) and 239Pu (n, F). Soft influence of exclusive neutron spectra on prompt fission neutron spectra observed in case of 240Pu (n, F) and 240Pu (n, xnf) at E = 7-8 MeV. The largest relative amplitude of exclusive neutron spectra 240Pu (n, xnf) is envisaged at E = 6-6.25 MeV. Prompt fission neutron spectra of 240Pu (n, F) are harder than those of 238U (n,F), but softer than prompt fission neutron spectra for 239Pu(n, F). 240Pu (n, F) prompt fission neutron spectra 240Pu shape is rather close to that of 239Pu(n, F), though the contribution of pre-fission neutrons is relatively higher. Exclusive neutron spectra (n, xnf) are consistent with (n,F) cross sections of 237-240Pu(n, F), as well as neutron emissive spectra of 239Pu(n, xn) at E = 14 MeV. We predict the exclusive pre-fission neutron spectra, exclusive neutron spectra of (n,xn) reactions, average total kinetic energy TKE of fission fragments and products, partials of of average prompt fission neutron number and observed prompt fission neutron spectra.</description>

      <title>Small cross section of the synthesis of darmstadtium in the $^{48}$Ca+$^{232}$Th reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The smallness of the cross section of evaporation residues formed in the hot fusion reaction $^{48}$Ca+$^{232}$Th is analyzed by the dinuclear system model (DNS). The capture probability has been calculated by solving the dynamical equations of motion for the relative distance between the centers-of-mass of the DNS nuclei. Fusion of nuclei is considered as evolution of the DNS to a stable compound nucleus. The fusion probability has a bell-like shape and quasifission is one of reasons causing smallness of the yield of the evaporation residues products. Another reason is the decrease of the fission barrier for the isotopes $^{275-285}$Dm related with the shell effects in the neutron structure. The agreement of the theoretical results obtained for the yield of the evaporation residues with the experimental data measured in the Factory of superheavy elements of Joint Institute for Nuclear Research is well.</description>

      <title>Improved predictions of phenomenological nuclear charge radius formulae with Bayesian optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model inputs play a key role in the performance of the Bayesian optimization approach. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the inputs on the improved predictions of phenomenological nuclear charge radius formulas using an approach combining those original formulas and the Bayesian neural network (BNN). We find that there is no improvement in predictions after the abnormal odd-even staggering effect of 181,183,185Hg is injected into the BNN, while the original phenomenological formulas themselves possess rich physical information or rigid constraints. It indicates the abundance and intensity of physical inputs affect the performance of the Bayesian optimization approach as well as the robustness of the BNN. We further demonstrate that, by ensuring that the number of neurons in the hidden layer is larger than the number of NN inputs, adding hidden layers into the BNN can significantly improve the predictions of nuclear charge radii formulas within the Bayesian optimization approach.</description>

      <title>Electric field induction in quark-gluon plasma due to thermoelectric effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions produce quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is locally thermalized. QGP with higher thermal conductivity advances towards global thermalization. Being made of electrically charged particles (quarks), QGP exhibits interesting thermoelectric phenomena during its evolution, resulting in the induction of an electric field in the medium. For the first time, we estimate the induced electric field in the QGP due to thermoelectric effect. This can be seen even in the QGP produced in the head-on collisions. The Seebeck coefficient is essential in determining the induced field. However, spectator current can produce a magnetic field in peripheral heavy-ion collisions. This breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric coefficient matrix and introduces magneto-Seebeck and Nernst coefficients that contribute to the induced electric field in peripheral collisions. We have taken care of the temperature evolution of QGP with different hydrodynamic cooling rates to calculate the transport coefficients. The induced electric field is estimated with the cooling rate obtained from Gubser hydrodynamic flow. We estimated the space-time profile of the induced field and found that it is zero at the center and increases as we go away from the center. At the early time of evolution, the electric field can reach a maximum value of $eE \approx 1~m_\pi^2$, and the strength decreases in time. Moreover, we estimated the transport coefficients in the presence of the external time-varying magnetic field. The effect of the intensity and decay parameter of the magnetic field on the induced electric field is also explored.</description>

      <title>Production of nuclei and hypernuclei in pion-induced reactions near threshold energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics model is employed to simulate $\pi^-+\mathrm{C}$ and $\pi^-+\mathrm{W}$ collisions at p$_\mathrm{lab}=1.7$ GeV motivated by the recent HADES results. By comparing the proton and $\Lambda$ transverse momentum spectra, it was observed that the data and transport model calculation show a good agreement, if cluster formation is included to obtain the free proton spectra. Predictions of light cluster ($d$, $t$, $^3$He, $^4$He, as well as ${}^{3}_\Lambda$H and $\Xi$N) multiplicities and spectra are made using a coalescence mechanism. The resulting multiplicities suggest that the pion beam experiment can produce a substantial amount of ${}^{3}_\Lambda$H, especially in $\pi^-+\mathrm{W}$ collisions due to the stopping of the $\Lambda$ inside the large tungsten nucleus. The findings are supplemented by a statistical multi-fragmentation analysis suggesting that even larger hyper-fragments are produced copiously. It is suggested that even double strange hypernuclei are in reach and might be studied in more detail using a slightly higher pion beam momentum.</description>

      <title>Probing configuration of $\alpha$ clusters with spectator particles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to use spectator particle yield ratios to probe the configuration of $\alpha$ clusters in $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O by their collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. The idea is illustrated based on initial density distributions with various $\alpha$-cluster configurations generated by a microscopic cluster model, and without $\alpha$ clusters from mean-field calculations. The multifragmentation of the spectator matter produces more spectator light nuclei including $\alpha$ clusters in collisions of nuclei with chain structure of $\alpha$ clusters, compared to those of nuclei with a more compact structure. The yield ratio of free spectator neutrons to spectator particles with mass-to-charge ratio $A/Z=2$ scaled by their masses can be practically measured by the zero-degree calorimeter (ZDC) at RHIC and LHC, serving as a clean probe free from modeling the complicated dynamics at midrapidities.</description>

      <title>A study of the fine-structure constant dependence of radiative capture in Halo-EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fine-structure constant dependence of the rates of some selected radiative capture reactions within the framework of so-called Halo Effective Field Theory in order to assess the adequacy of some assumptions made on the Coulomb penetrability. We find that this dependence deviates from that implied by a parameterization of the cross sections of this effect via a simple penetration factor. Some features of this fine-structure dependence are discussed, in particular its potential impact on the abundances of the light elements in primordial nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres predicts the stability of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spite of the empirical success of the Weizsaecker mass formula, a predictive, physics-based, analytical estimate of the stability chart of nuclei has remained elusive. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides an excellent description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory is able to predict the most quoted ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$ for stable nuclides, in agreement with experimental observations without any fitting parameter. This provides a solution to a longstanding mystery in nuclear physics: until now, the stability of atomic nuclei was empirically described by the Bethe-Weizsaecker mass formula, which, only thanks to 4-5 adjustable fitting parameters, can capture the tendency of large nuclei to be rich in neutrons. The latter phenomenon was traditionally (qualitatively) explained in terms of a subtle balance between electrostatics and asymmetry effects due to the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that the larger stability of neutron-rich nuclei is the result of a maximized nuclear density, which is controlled by geometric packing considerations.</description>

      <title>Acausality in truncated 'MIS'-type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The causal-stable Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory is known to have a finite number of out of equilibrium derivative order corrections but requires treating the viscosity tensor as a separate degree of freedom with its own equations of motion, apart from the fundamental fluid degrees of freedom like velocity and temperature. In this work, I will show that it is possible to rewrite the MIS theory only in terms of velocity and temperature, but the resultant constitutive relation for dissipation must include all orders of gradient corrections. In this work I will argue that an all-order resummation of gradient contributions is equivalent to introducing new `non-fluid' degrees of freedom in the MIS theory. It will also be shown, using the relativistic quantum causality condition, that any finitely truncated order of derivative correction, however high it is, leads to a theory that is acausal, unless the corrections are infinitely summed up to all orders.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Roy-equation analyses on lattice data of $\pi\pi$ scattering phase shifts at $m_\pi=391$MeV reveals that the lowest $f_0$ meson becomes a bound state under this condition. In addition, there is a pair of complex poles below threshold generated by crossing symmetry [X.-H. Cao et al., Phys. Rev. D 108, 034009 (2023)]. We use the $N/D$ method to partially recover crossing symmetry of the $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model amplitude at leading order of $1/N$ expansion, and qualitatively reproduce the pole structure and pole trajectories with varying pion masses as revealed by Roy-equation analyses. The $\sigma$ pole trajectory with varying temperature is also discussed and found to be similar to its properties when varying $m_\pi$. As the temperature increases, the complex $\sigma$ poles firstly move from the second Riemann sheet to the real axis becoming two virtual state poles, and then one virtual state pole moves to the first sheet turning into a bound state pole and finally tends to the pion pole position at high temperature which is as expected from the chiral symmetry restoration. Our results provide further evidences that the lowest $f_0$ state extracted from experiments and lattice data plays the role of $\sigma$ meson in the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Finally, we also briefly discuss the problems of the effective potential in the situation when $m_\pi$ and temperature get large.</description>
