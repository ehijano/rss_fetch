      <title>The Orbit-Summable Fixed Point Criterion and its Relation to Caristi's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between geometric and variational principles remains central to Nonlinear Analysis. This paper introduces the \textbf{Orbit-Summability Fixed Point Criterion}, a novel, purely dynamical condition, and establishes its profound connection to \textbf{Caristi`s Fixed Point Theorem} in complete metric spaces.
  Our criterion, which requires only that the total displacement along a single orbit be finite (the orbit-summability property), provides a practical and concrete tool for checking the existence of fixed points without relying on the construction of an abstract potential function.
  We demonstrate that, under a minimal regularity assumption involving the function $f$ and the metric $d$, the Orbit-Summability Criterion is \textbf{precisely equivalent} to Caristi`s Fixed Point Theorem. This equivalence is conceptually significant as it creates a direct bridge between the geometric principle of \textbf{dynamical gap summability} (akin to the core idea in Banach`s Contraction Principle) and the variational principle of Caristi.
  As a direct consequence of this equivalence, the classical \textbf{Banach Contraction Principle is recovered as a straightforward corollary}. The methodology is designed to merge key elements from the Banach proof (orbit convergence via summability) with the structural requirements of Caristi (majorization by a well-behaved functional), effectively providing a unifying framework for these fundamental results. Thus, the Orbit-Summability Criterion offers an attractive and accessible perspective on these established cornerstones of Fixed Point Theory.</description>

      <title>Rough Weighted Ideal Convergence and Korovkin-Type Approximation via weighted equi-ideal convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $\omega_t &gt; \beta$ for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and for some $\beta &gt; 0$, then the sequence $\{\omega_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$ represents a weighted sequence of real numbers. In this article, we primarily introduce the concepts of rough weighted ideal limit set and rough weighted ideal cluster points set associated with sequences in normed spaces. Building on these concepts, we derive several important results, including a characterization of maximal ideals, a representation of closed sets in normed spaces, and an analysis of the minimal convergent degree required for the rough weighted ideal limit set to be non-empty. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for an analytic $P$-ideal, the rough weighted ideal limit set forms an $F_{\sigma\delta}$ subset of the normed space. Finally, we introduce the concept of weighted equi-ideal convergence for sequences of functions with respect to analytic $P$-ideals, extending the notion of equi-statistical convergence [Balcerzak et al., J. Math. Anal. Appl. {328} (1) (2007)]. As an application of this notion, we establish a Korovkin-type approximation theorem that serves both as a generalization of [Theorem 2.4, Karaku{\c{s}} et al., J. Math. Anal. Appl. {339} (2) (2008)] and a correction to [Theorem 2.2, Akda\u{g}, Results Math. {72} (3) (2017)].</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Lebesgue spaces: Dense subspaces, completeness and separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L^p spaces of mappings taking values in arbitrary metric spaces, which we call nonlinear Lebesgue spaces, play an important role in several fields of mathematics. For instance, membership in these spaces is typically required for transport maps in optimal transport theory and for stochastic processes in probability theory. Nonlinear Lebesgue spaces also arise naturally in applications such as medical imaging, where the physical signals at play often exhibit little regularity and take their values in nonlinear spaces. Yet, these spaces remain little studied in the literature, likely due to their lack of differential structure outside the case where mappings are valued in a linear space. This paper is the first in a series by the authors devoted to the study of geometric and analytic properties of nonlinear Lebesgue spaces. The present article exposes a systematic treatment of their measure-theoretic properties, unifying and refining scattered results from the literature while also extending classical results from the linear setting to this broader nonlinear framework -- including the characterizations of their completeness and their separability as well as the density of some of their subspaces: the spaces of simple, continuous and smooth mappings.</description>

      <title>On Dirichlet Spaces of Homogeneous Type Via Heat Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the properties of Dirichlet Spaces of Homogeneous type which consist of band limited functions that are nearly exponential localizations on $\mathbb{R}^k.$ This is a powerful tool in harmonic analysis and it makes various spaces of functions and distributions more approachable, utilizable and providing non-zero representation of natural function spaces, such as Besov space, on $\mathbb{R}^k$. Spheres and homogeneous spaces can also admit such frames on the intervals and balls. Here, we present mainly the band limited frames that are well-localized in the general setting of Dirichlet spaces of Homogeneous type which have doubling measure and a local scale-invariant Poincare inequality which generates heat kernels through the Gaussian bounds and H$\ddot{o}$lder's continuity. As an application of this build-up, band limited frames are generated in the context of Lie groups which are homogeneous in nature with polynomial volume growth, complete Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below and admits the volume doubling property, together with other settings. In this general setting, decomposition of Besov spaces was done with the new frames.</description>

Abstract: We study the subsymmetric basic sequence structure of variable exponent Lebesgue spaces $L_{P}$ built from index functions $P\colon\Omega\to(0,\infty]$ on $\sigma$-finite measure spaces $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)$. Specifically, we prove that if $P$ is bounded away from infinity, then any complemented subsymmetric basic sequence of $L_{P}$ is equivalent to the canonical basis of $\ell_r$ for some $r\ge 1$ in the essential range of $P$.</description>

      <title>Characterising the sets of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14820v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H\subseteq L^2(\mathbb R)$ we consider the convex sets $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ of Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e.~density matrices over $\mathcal H$ with non-negative Wigner function. We investigate the topological structure of these sets, namely concerning closure, compactness, interior and boundary (in a relative topology induced by the trace norm). We also study their geometric structure and construct minimal sets of states that generate $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ through convex combinations. If $\mathcal H$ is finite-dimensional, the existence of such sets follows from a central result in convex analysis, namely the Krein-Milman theorem. In the infinite-dimensional case $\mathcal H=L^2(\mathbb R)$ this is not so, due to lack of compactness of the set $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$. Nevertheless, we prove that a Krein-Milman theorem holds in this case, which allows us to extend most of the results concerning the sets of generators to the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we study the relation between the finite and infinite-dimensional sets of WPS, and prove that the former provide a hierarchy of closed subsets, which are also proper faces of the latter. These results provide a basis for an operational characterisation of the extreme points of the sets of WPS, which we undertake in a companion paper. Our work offers a unified perspective on the topological and geometric properties of the sets of WPS in finite and infinite dimensions, along with explicit constructions of minimal sets of generators.</description>

      <title>A topological characterization of indecomposable sets of finite perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a set of finite perimeter is indecomposable if and only if it is, up to a choice of suitable representative, connected in the 1-fine topology. This gives a topological characterization of indecomposability which is new even in Euclidean spaces. Our approach relies crucially on the metric space theory of functions of bounded variation, and we are able to prove our main result in a complete, doubling metric measure space supporting a $1$-Poincar\'{e} inequality and having the two-sidedness property (this class includes all Riemannian manifolds, Carnot groups, and ${\sf RCD}(K,N)$ spaces with $K\in\mathbb R$ and $N&lt;\infty$). As an immediate corollary, we obtain an alternative proof of the decomposition theorem for sets of finite perimeter into maximal indecomposable components.</description>

      <title>The stability of log-supermodularity under convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of log-supermodular functions under convolution. In particular we show that log-concave product densities preserve log-supermodularity, confirming in the special case of the standard Gaussian density, a conjecture of Zartash and Robeva. Additionally, this stability gives a ``conditional'' entropy power inequality for log-supermodular random variables. We also compare the Ahlswede-Daykin four function theorem and a recent four function version of the Prekopa-Leindler inequality due to Cordero-Erausquin and Maurey and giving transport proofs for the two theorems. In the Prekopa-Leindler case, the proof gives a generalization that seems to be new, which interpolates the classical three and the recent four function versions.</description>

      <title>Spectral Shinkage of Gaussian Entropic Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a functional calculus treatment of Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) between Gaussian measures on separable Hilbert spaces, providing a unified framework that handles infinite-dimensional degeneracy. By leveraging the notion of proper alignment and the Schur complement, we reveal that the Gaussian EOT solution operates as a precise \textit{spectral shrinkage}: the optimal coupling is uniquely determined by contracting the spectrum of the correlation operator via a universal scalar function. This geometric insight facilitates an algorithmic shift from iterative fixed-point schemes (e.g., Sinkhorn) to direct algebraic computation, enabling efficient multi-scale analysis, where a single spectral decomposition allows for the exact evaluation of entropic costs across arbitrary regularization parameters $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ at negligible additional cost. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic behavior as $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$ in settings where the unregularized Optimal Transport problem admits non-unique solutions. We establish a selection principle that the regularized limit converges to the most diffusive optimal coupling --characterized as the centroid of the convex set of optimal Kantorovich plans. This demonstrates that in degenerate regimes, the entropic limit systematically rejects deterministic Monge solutions (extremal points) in favor of the optimal solution with minimal Hilbert-Schmidt correlation, effectively filtering out spurious correlations in the null space. Finally, we derive stability bounds and convergence rates, recovering established parametric rates ($\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon)$) in finite dimensions while identifying distinct non-parametric rates dependent on spectral decay in infinite-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Computing multiple solutions from knowledge of the critical set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {We explore a simple {\it geometric model} for functions between spaces of the same dimension (in infinite dimensions, we require that Jacobians be Fredholm operators of index zero). The model combines standard results in analysis and topology associated with familiar global and local aspects. Functions are supposed to be proper on bounded sets. The model is valid for a large class of semilinear elliptic differential operators.
  It also provides a fruitful context for numerical analysis. 
  For a function $F: X \to Y$ between real Banach spaces, continuation methods to solve $F(x) = y$ may improve from considerations about the global geometry of $F$.
  We consider three classes of examples. First we handle functions from the Euclidean plane to itself, for which the reasoning behind the techniques is visualizable. The second, between spaces of dimension 15, is obtained by discretizing a nonlinear Sturm-Liouville problem for which special right hand sides admit abundant solutions. Finally, we compute the six solutions of a semilinear elliptic equation $-\Delta u - f(u) = g$ studied by Solimini.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies the temporal approximation of hyperbolic semilinear stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise by Milstein-type schemes. We take the term hyperbolic to mean that the leading operator generates a contractive, not necessarily analytic $C_0$-semigroup. Optimal convergence rates are derived for the pathwise uniform strong error \[
  E_h^\infty := \Big(\mathbb{E}\max_{1\le j \le M}\|U_{t_j}-u_j\|_X^p\Big)^{1/p} \] on a Hilbert space $X$ for $p\in [2,\infty)$. Here, $U$ is the mild solution and $u_j$ its Milstein approximation at time $t_j=jh$ with step size $h&gt;0$ and final time $T=Mh&gt;0$. For sufficiently regular nonlinearity and noise, we establish strong convergence of order one, with the error satisfying $E_h^\infty\lesssim h\sqrt{\log(T/h)}$ for rational Milstein schemes and $E_h^\infty \lesssim h$ for exponential Milstein schemes. This extends previous results from parabolic to hyperbolic SPDEs and from exponential to rational Milstein schemes. Root-mean-square error estimates are strengthened to pathwise uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the convergence rates for the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Further applications to Maxwell's and transport equations are included.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sobolev inequalities in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the optimal function norm on the left-hand side of the $m$th order Sobolev type inequality $\|u\|_{Y(\mathbb{H}^n)} \leq C \|\nabla_g^m u\|_{X(\mathbb{H}^n)}$ in the $n$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$, $1\leq m &lt; n$. The optimal function norm in the inequality among all rearrangement-invariant function norms is completely characterized. A variety of concrete examples of optimal function norms is provided. The examples include delicate limiting cases, and especially when $m\geq3$, seem to provide new, improved inequalities in these limiting cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the universal approximation theorem for rough path functionals, introducing a polynomial-based approximation class. We extend universal approximation to non-geometric rough paths within the tensor algebra. This development addresses critical needs in finance, where no-arbitrage conditions necessitate It\^o integration. Furthermore, our findings motivate a hypothesis for payoff functionals in financial markets, allowing straightforward analysis of signature payoffs proposed in \cite{arribas2018derivativespricingusingsignature}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A weighted composition operator on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is given by a composition, followed by a multiplication. We study unitary and co-isometric weighted composition operators on unitarily invariant spaces on the Euclidean unit ball $\mathbb B_d$. We establish a dichotomy between the spaces $\mathcal{H}_\gamma$ with reproducing kernel $(1 - \langle z,w \rangle)^{-\gamma}$ for $\gamma &gt; 0$, and all other spaces. Whereas the former admit many unitary weighted composition operators, the latter only admit trivial ones. This extends results of Mart\'in, Mas and Vukoti\'c from the disc to the ball. Some of our results continue to hold when $d = \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical learning theory, interpolation spaces of the form $[\mathrm{L}^2,H]_{\theta,r}$, where $H$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, are in widespread use. So far, however, they are only well understood for fine index $r=2$. We generalise existing results from $r=2$ to all possible values of $r$. In particular, we present a spectral decomposition of such spaces, analyse their embedding properties, and describe connections to the theory of Banach spaces of functions. We additionally present example applications of our results to regularisation error estimation in statistical learning.</description>

      <title>Approximation by Neural Network operators in $L^p$ spaces associated with an arbitrary measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximation behavior of both one and multidimensional neural network type operators for functions in $L^p(I^d,\rho)$, where $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, associated with a general measure $\rho$ defined over a hypercube. First, we prove the uniform approximation for a continuous function and the $L^p$ approximation theorem by the NN operators in one and multidimensional settings. In addition, we also obtain the $L^p$ error bounds in terms of $\mathcal{K}$-functionals for these neural network operators. Finally, we consider the logistic and tangent hyperbolic activation functions and verify the hypothesis of the theorems. We also show the implementation of continuous and integrable functions by NN operators with respect to the Lebesgue and Jacobi measures defined on $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ with logistic and tangent hyperbolic activation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish boundedness of the $H^\infty$-calculus for the Dirichlet Laplacian on conical domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and corresponding wedges on $L^p$-spaces with mixed weights. The weights are based on both the distance to the boundary and the distance to the tip/edge of the cone/wedge. Our main motivation comes from the study of stochastic partial differential equations and associated degenerate deterministic parabolic equations on non-smooth domains. As a consequence of our analysis, we also obtain maximal $L^p$-regularity for the Poisson equation on conical domains in appropriate weighted Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Nested superposition principle for random measures and the geometry of the Wasserstein on Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometric structure of the space of random measures $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{P}_p(X))$, endowed with the Wasserstein on Wasserstein metric, where $(X, d)$ is a complete separable metric space. In this setting, we prove a metric superposition principle, in the spirit of the result by S. Lisini, that will allow us to recover important geometric features of the space. When $X$ is $\mathbb{R}^d$, we study the differential structure of $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d))$ in analogy with the simpler Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$. We show that continuity equations for random measures involving the abstract concept of derivation acting on cylinder functions can be more conveniently described by suitable non-local vector fields $b:[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{R}^d$. In this way, we can: 1) characterize the absolutely continuous curves on the Wasserstein on Wasserstein space; 2) define and characterize its tangent bundle; 3) prove a superposition principle for the solutions to the standard non-local continuity equation in terms of solutions of interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>A new interpolation method for metric spaces based on bi-infinite sequences: The $R$-Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new interpolation method for metric spaces, termed the $R$-method, based
  on bi-infinite linking sequences. Although the construction is inspired by the classical
  metric functional $J_M$, the resulting interpolated space is generated by a distinct
  object that behaves as a multiscale energy functional. This functional measures the
  minimal discrete action required to connect two points through $\mathbb{Z}$-indexed
  sequences, leading to a new intrinsic metric on $X_0 \cap X_1$.
  The associated interpolated space is obtained as the relative completion of this metric
  inside $X_0 \cup X_1$ and is genuinely different from those produced by the $J_M$- and
  $K_M$-methods. A fundamental structural property of the $R$-method is that the resulting
  space embeds continuously into the corresponding $K_M$-interpolated space, situating the
  construction naturally within the existing theory of metric interpolation.
  When the method is restricted to a normed setting, the $R$-method induces a genuine
  interpolation functor. In this framework, it preserves the Lipschitz property of
  operators with closed graphs, even in the absence of linearity, thereby extending the
  classical scope of interpolation theory, which is traditionally confined to linear
  continuous operators. As a consequence, standard compactness properties are also
  preserved under mild assumptions.
  The $R$-method thus provides a new interpolation framework whose foundations rely
  exclusively on intrinsic metric properties and the summability of discrete orbits,
  bridging metric interpolation, nonlinear analysis, and classical interpolation theory.</description>

Abstract: The present article describes the precise structure of the $L^{p}$-spaces of projective limit measures by introducing a category theoretical perspective. This analysis is applied to measures on vector spaces and in particular to Gaussian measures on nuclear topological vector spaces. A simple application to constructive Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is given through the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19583v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that there exists a nontrivial uniform algebra that is Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space and has a dense set of elements that are exponentials. This answers a 65-year-old question of John Wermer and a 17-year-old question of Garth Dales and Joel Feinstein. Our example is P(X) for a certain compact set X in complex Euclidean 2-space ($\mathbb{C}^2$). It is also shown that there exists a logmodular uniform algebra with proper Shilov boundary but with no nontrivial Gleason parts. This answers a modification of another 65-year-old question of Wermer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use abstract bifurcation theory for Fredholm operators of index zero to deal with periodic even solutions of the one-dimensional equation $\mathcal{L}u=\lambda u+|u|^{p}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is a nonlocal pseudodifferential operator defined as a Fourier multiplier and $\lambda$ is the bifurcation parameter. Our general setting includes the fractional Laplacian $\mathcal{L}\equiv(-\Delta)^{s}$ and sharpens the results obtained for this operator to date. As a direct application, we establish the existence of traveling waves for general nonlocal dispersive equations for some velocity ranges.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, are practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We study the fixed points of the Berezin transform on the Fock-type spaces $F_m^2$ with the weight $e^{-|z|^m}, m &gt; 0.$ It is known that the Berezin transform is well-defined on the polynomials in $z$ and $\overline{z}$. In this paper we focus on the polynomial fixed points and we show that these polynomials must be harmonic, except possibly for countably many $m \in (0, \infty).$ We also show that, in some particular cases, the fixed point polynomials are harmonic for all $m.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish extrapolation of compactness for bilinear operators in the scale of weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces. First, we prove an abstract principle relying on the Cobos-Fern\'{a}ndez-Cabrera-Mart\'{i}nez theorem. Then, as an application we deduce new compactness results for the commutators of bilinear $\omega$-Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators, bilinear fractional integrals and bilinear Fourier multipliers acting on weighted variable exponent Lebesgue spaces. Our work extends and unifies among others earlier works of the second named author together with Hyt\"{o}nen as well as Oikari.</description>

Abstract: We study a generalization of conditional probability for arbitrary ordered vector spaces. A related problem is that of assigning a numerical value to one vector relative to another.
  We characterize the groups for which these generalized probabilities can be stationary, respectively invariant. Our results deviate from the setting of classical probability; this leads to a new criterion for amenability and for fixed points in cones.</description>
