      <title>Confusion concerning the extrapolated endpoint. When will it ever end?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their landmark paper on ``the Brownian motion analog of the well-known Milne problem in radiative transfer theory'' [\textit{J Stat Phys} 25 (1981) 569--82], Burschka and Titulaer reported: ``The value we find for this `Milne extrapolation length' is, in the appropriate dimensionless units, approximately twice the value found in the radiative transfer problem.'' In a study [\textit{J Stat Phys} 65 (1991) 1217--33] dealing with the absorption by a black sphere of particles executing a Rayleigh flight (randomly directed displacements of equal length), the same quantity was found to be about half as small as the benchmark reslt. The first discrepancy is shown to result from the disparity of the two length scales; the second, from the zero variance of the jump lengths. It is stressed that, though all random walk models lead, by virtue of the central limit theorem, to the diffusion equation, they do not all lead to the same boundary condition. Some relevent publications from the past overlooked by Ziff are recalled.</description>

      <title>Fock Space and Field Theoretic Description of Nonequilibrium Work Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider classical, interacting particles coupled to a thermal reservoir and subject to a local, time-varying potential while undergoing hops on a lattice. We impose detailed balance on the hopping rates and map the dynamics to the Fock space Doi representation, from which we derive the Jarzynski and Crooks relations. Here the local potential serves to drive the system far from equilibrium and to provide the work. Next, we utilize the coherent state representation to map the system to a Doi-Peliti field theory and take the continuum limit. We demonstrate that time reversal in this field theory takes the form of a gauge-like transformation which leaves the action invariant up to a generated work term. The time-reversal symmetry leads to a fundamental identity, from which we are able to derive the Jarzynski and Crooks relations, as well as a far-from-equilibrium generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation relation.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of emergent cluster states by measurement from symmetry-protected-topological states with large symmetry to subsystem cat state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose measurement-producing hierarchy emerging among correlated states by sequential subsystem projective measurements. We start from symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) cluster states with a large symmetry and apply sequential subsystem projective measurements to them and find that generalized cluster SPT states with a reduced symmetry appear in the subsystem of the unmeasured sites. That prescription finally produces Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger states with long-range order in the subsystem composed of periodic unmeasured sites of the original lattice. The symmetry-reduction hierarchical structure from a general large symmetric SPT cluster state is clearly captured by the measurement update flow in the efficient algorithm of stabilizer formalism. This approach is useful not only for the analytical search for the measured state but also for numerical simulation with a large system size. We also numerically verify the symmetry-reduction hierarchy by sequential subsystem projective measurements applied to large systems and large symmetric cluster SPT states.</description>

      <title>Resonant-force induced symmetry breaking in a quantum parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A parametrically modulated oscillator has two opposite-phase vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. An extra force at the vibration frequency breaks the symmetry of the states. The effect can be extremely strong due to the interplay between the force and the quantum fluctuations resulting from the coupling of the oscillator to a thermal bath. The force changes the rates of the fluctuation-induced walk over the quantum states of the oscillator. If the number of the states is large, the effect accumulates to an exponentially large factor in the rate of switching between the vibrational states. We find the factor and analyze it in the limiting cases. We show that in the zero-temperature limit the extra force breaks the detailed balance, leading to a nonperturbatively strong increase of the switching rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the currents of the defocusing Ablowitz-Ladik chain are unambiguously defined, no explicit formulas for their densities have been obtained yet. We close this gap. As a consequence, we also complete the argument which establishes the anticipated expression for average currents, averaged over a generalized Gibbs ensemble.</description>

      <title>On the spontaneous magnetization of two-dimensional ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetism is typically discussed in terms of the exchange interaction and magnetic anisotropies. Yet real samples are inevitably affected by the magnetostatic dipole-dipole interaction. Because of this interaction, a theorem (R.B. Griffiths, Free Energy of interacting magnetic dipoles, Phys. Rev. 176, 655 (1968)) forbids a spontaneous magnetization in, nota bene, three-dimensional bodies. Here we discuss perpendicularly and in-plane magnetized ferromagnetic bodies in the shape of a slab of finite thickness. In perpendicularly magnetized slabs, magnetic domains are energetically favored when the lateral size is sufficiently large, i.e. there is no spontaneous magnetization. For in-plane magnetization, instead, spontaneous magnetization is possible below a critical thickness which, in real thin films, could be as small as few monolayers. At this critical thickness, we predict a genuine phase transition to a multi-domain state. These results have implications for two-dimensional ferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite number of universality classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, but this version remarkably reveals the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.</description>

      <title>Sokoban percolation on the Bethe lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: `With persistence, a drop of water hollows out the stone' goes the ancient Greek proverb. Yet, canonical percolation models do not account for interactions between a moving tracer and its environment. Recently, we have introduced the Sokoban model, which differs from this convention by allowing a tracer to push single obstacles that block its path. To test how this newfound ability affects percolation, we hereby consider a Bethe lattice on which obstacles are scattered randomly and ask for the probability that the Sokoban percolates through this lattice, i.e., escapes to infinity. We present an exact solution to this problem and determine the escape probability as a function of obstacle density. Similar to regular percolation, we show that the escape probability undergoes a second-order phase transition. We exactly determine the critical obstacle density at which this transition occurs and show that it is higher than that of a tracer without obstacle-pushing abilities. Our findings assert that pushing facilitates percolation on the Bethe lattice, as intuitively expected. This result, however, sharply contrasts with our previous findings on the 2D square lattice. There, the Sokoban cannot escape $\unicode{x2013}$ not even at densities well below the percolation threshold. We discuss the reasons behind this striking difference, which calls for a deeper and better understanding of percolation in the presence of tracer-media interactions.</description>

      <title>Coarsening in Bent-core Liquid Crystals: Intermediate Splay Bend State en route to the Twist Bend Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics simulations to study coarsening dynamics in achiral banana-shaped bent-core liquid crystals following a quench from the high concentration polar smectic (SmX) phase to lower concentrations that favor the exotic twist-bend (TB) phase. Our novel result is the identification of an intermediate splay-bend state emerging prior to the eventual TB phase. The latter coarsens via the annihilation of {\it beta lines} which are analogous to string defects in nematic liquid crystals. Our findings are relevant for a large class of chiral systems assembled from achiral entities.</description>

      <title>Network analysis for the steady-state thermodynamic uncertainty relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform network analysis of a system described by the master equation to estimate the lower bound of the steady-state current noise, starting from the level 2.5 large deviation function and using the graph theory approach. When the transition rates are uniform, and the system is driven to a non-equilibrium steady state by unidirectional transitions, we derive a noise lower bound, which accounts for fluctuations of sojourn times at all states and is expressed using mesh currents. This bound is applied to the uncertainty in the signal-to-noise ratio of the fluctuating computation time of a schematic Brownian computation plus reset process described by a graph containing one cycle. Unlike the mixed and pseudo-entropy bounds that increase logarithmically with the length of the intended computation path, this bound depends on the number of extraneous predecessors and thus captures the logical irreversibility.</description>

Abstract: Equations are obtained for the quantum distribution functions over discrete states in systems of non-interacting fermions and bosons with an arbitrary, including small, number of particles. The case of systems with two levels is considered in detail. The temperature dependences of entropy, heat capacities and pressure in two-level Fermi and Bose systems are calculated for various multiplicities of degeneracy of levels.</description>

      <title>The Griffiths phase and beyond: A large deviations study of the magnetic susceptibility of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Griffiths phase in systems with quenched disorder occurs below the ordering transition of the pure system down to the ordering transition of the actual disordered system. While it does not exhibit long-range order, large fluctuations in the disorder degrees of freedom result in exponentially rare, long-range ordered states and hence the occurrence of broad distributions in response functions. Inside the Griffiths phase of the two-dimensional bond-diluted Ising model the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility is expected to have such a broad, exponential tail. A large-deviations Monte Carlo algorithm is used to sample this distribution and the exponential tail is extracted over a wide range of the support down to very small probabilities of the order of $10^{-300}$. We study the behavior of the susceptibility distribution across the full phase diagram, from the paramagnetic state through the Griffiths phase to the ferromagnetically ordered system and down to the zero-temperature point. We extract the rate function of large-deviation theory as well as its finite-size scaling behavior and we reveal interesting differences and similarities between the cases. A connection between the fraction of ferromagnetic bonds in a given disorder sample and the size of the magnetic susceptibility is demonstrated numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the transverse and longitudinal properties of hard disks confined in narrow channels. We employ an exact mapping of the system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse, nonadditive mixture of hard rods with equal chemical potentials. We compute various thermodynamic properties, including the transverse and longitudinal equations of state, along with their behaviors at both low and high densities. Structural properties are analyzed using the two-body correlation function and the radial distribution function, tailored for the highly anisotropic geometry of this system. The results are corroborated by computer simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The smooth emergence of shear elasticity is an hallmark of the liquid to glass transition. In a liquid, viscous stresses arise from local structural rearrangements. In the solid, Eshelby has shown that stresses around an inclusion decay as a power law $r^{-D}$, where $D$ is the dimension of the system. We study glass-forming hard sphere fluids by simulation and observe the emergence of the unscreened power-law Eshelby pattern in the stress correlations of the isotropic liquid state. By a detailed tensorial analysis, we show that the fluctuating force field, viz.~the divergence of the stress field, relaxes to zero with time in all states, while the shear stress correlations develop spatial power-law structures inside regions that grow with longitudinal and transverse sound speeds; we observe the predicted exponents $r^{-D}$ and $r^{-D-2}$. In Brownian systems, shear stresses relax diffusively within these regions, with the diffusion coefficient determined by the shear modulus and the friction coefficient.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium relaxation and odd-even effect in finite-temperature electron gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pauli blocking in Fermi liquids imposes strong phase-space constraints on quasiparticle lifetimes, leading to a well-known quadratic-in-temperature decay rate of quasiparticle modes at low temperatures. In two-dimensional systems, however, even longer-lived modes are predicted (dubbed "odd-parity" modes). Here, we present an efficient method to evaluate the full spectrum of relaxational eigenmodes of a Fermi liquid within kinetic theory. We employ this method to study the experimentally relevant case of a Fermi liquid with screened Coulomb interactions and map out the decay rates of quasiparticle modes beyond the asymptotic low temperature limit up to the Fermi temperature, thus covering the temperature range of typical experiments. We confirm the existence of anomalously long-lived odd-parity modes and provide a comprehensive classification and detailed analysis of the relaxation spectrum. In particular, we find that (i) the odd-parity effect in the decay rates extends to temperatures as large as $T=0.1T_F$; (ii) there is only a small number of long-lived odd-parity modes, with an infinite number of remaining modes that show standard Fermi-liquid scaling; (iii) the ratio between the odd- and even-parity lifetimes is tunable with the Coulomb interaction strength, not just temperature, which reflects a difference in the microscopic relaxation mechanism of the modes. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of two-dimensional electron gases and bridge a significant gap in our understanding of these systems.</description>

Abstract: We show by extensive simulations that the whole supercritical phase of the three-dimensional uniform forest model simultaneously exhibits an infinite tree and a rich variety of critical phenomena. Besides typical scalings like algebraically decaying correlation, power-law distribution of cluster sizes, and divergent correlation length, a number of anomalous behaviors emerge. The fractal dimensions for off-giant trees take different values when being measured by linear system size or gyration radius. The giant-tree size displays two-length scaling fluctuations, instead of following the central-limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium protection and spatial localization of noise-induced fluctuations: Quasi-one-dimensional driven lattice gas with partially penetrable obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11658v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonequilibrium transition that leads to the formation of nonlinear steady-state structures due to the gas flow scattering on a partially penetrable obstacle. The resulting nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) corresponds to a two-domain gas structure attained at certain critical parameters. We use a simple mean-field model of the driven lattice gas with ring topology to demonstrate that this transition is accompanied by the emergence of local invariants related to a complex composed of the obstacle and its nearest gas surrounding, which we refer to as obstacle edges. These invariants are independent of the main system parameters and behave as local first integrals, at least qualitatively. As a result, the complex becomes insensitive to the noise of external driving field within the overcritical domain. The emerged invariants describe the conservation of the number of particles inside the obstacle and strong temporal synchronization or correlation of gas states at obstacle edges. Such synchronization guarantees the equality to zero of the total edge current at any time. The robustness against external drive fluctuations is shown to be accompanied by strong spatial localization of induced gas fluctuations near the domain wall separating the depleted and dense gas phases. Such a behavior can be associated with nonequilibrium protection effect and synchronization of edges. The transition rates between different NESSs are shown to be different. The relaxation rates from one NESS to another take complex and real values in the sub- and overcritical regimes, respectively. The mechanism of these transitions is governed by the generation of shock waves at the back side of the obstacle. In the subcritical regime, these solitary waves are generated sequentially many times, while only a single excitation is sufficient to rearrange the system state in the overcritical regime.</description>

      <title>Consequence of anisotropy on flocking: the discretized Vicsek model</title>

Abstract: We numerically study a discretized Vicsek model (DVM) with particles orienting in $q$ possible orientations in two dimensions. The study probes the significance of anisotropic orientation and microscopic interaction on the macroscopic behavior. The DVM is an off-lattice flocking model like the active clock model [ACM; EPL {\bf 138}, 41001 (2022)] but the dynamical rules of particle alignment and movement are inspired by the prototypical Vicsek model (VM). The DVM shows qualitatively similar properties as the ACM for intermediate noise strength where a transition from macrophase to microphase separation of the coexistence region is observed as $q$ is increased. But for small $q$ and noise strength, the liquid phase appearing in the ACM at low temperatures is replaced in the DVM by a configuration of multiple clusters with different polarization which does not exhibit any long-range order. We find that the dynamical rules have a profound influence on the overarching features of the flocking phase. We further identify the metastability of the ordered liquid phase subjected to a perturbation.</description>

      <title>Conformal invariance and composite operators: A strategy for improving the derivative expansion of the nonperturbative renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is expected that conformal symmetry is an emergent property of many systems at their critical point. This imposes strong constraints on the critical behavior of a given system. Taking them into account in theoretical approaches can lead to a better understanding of the critical physics or improve approximation schemes. However, within the framework of the non-perturbative or functional renormalization group and, in particular, of one of its most used approximation schemes, the Derivative Expansion (DE), non-trivial constraints only apply from third order (usually denoted $\mathcal{O}(\partial^4)$), at least in the usual formulation of the DE that includes correlation functions involving only the order parameter. In this work, we implement conformal constraints on a generalized DE including composite operators and show that new constraints already appear at second order of the DE (or $\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$). We show how these constraints can be used to fix nonphysical regulator parameters.</description>

Abstract: In nonequilibrium statistical physics, quantifying the nearest (and higher-order) neighbors and free volumes of particles in many-body systems is crucial to elucidating the origin of macroscopic collective phenomena, such as glass/granular jamming transitions and various aspects of the behavior of active matter. However, conventional techniques (based on a fixed-distance cutoff or the Voronoi construction) have mainly been applied to equilibrated, homogeneous, and monodisperse particle systems. In this paper, we implement simple and efficient methods for local structure analysis in nonequilibrium, inhomogeneous, and polydisperse hard disk systems. We show how these novel methods can overcome the difficulties encountered by conventional techniques, as well as demonstrating some applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "catalytic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The catalyst is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of this catalytic coagulation model for the case of mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>

Abstract: Biological motors, as counterpart of heat engines, are driven by a chemical gradient to output mechanical work and play critical roles in biological functions, such as the ATP synthesis. Its thermodynamic efficiency, along with power, are two vital criteria for evaluating the performance of these motors. In this letter, we investigate a model of a microscopic chemical engine and assess the constraint relation between power and efficiency for the cycle with finite operation time. Our model demonstrates a general constraint relation between power and efficiency, and predicts that the efficiency at maximum power in the large friction regime is half of the maximum quasi-static efficiency, i.e., 1/2. These findings shall provide new direction to optimize the operation of microscopic biological motors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement In Mixed-Spin Trimmer: Effects of A Magnetic Field And Heterogeneous g-Factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) trimmer with two different Land\'{e} g-factors and two different exchange couplings is considered. The main feature of the model is non-conserving magnetization. The Hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized analytically. We presented a detailed analysis of the ground state properties, revealing several possible ground state phase diagrams and magnetization profiles. The main focus is on how non-conserving magnetization affects quantum entanglement. We have found that non-conserving magnetization can bring to the continuous dependence of the entanglement quantifying parameter (negativity) on magnetic field within the same eigenstate, while for the case of uniform $g$-factors it is a constant. The main result is an essential enhancement of the entanglement in case of uniform couplings for one pair of spins caused by an arbitrary small difference in the values of $g$-factors. This enhancement is robust and brings to almost 7-fold increasing of the negativity. We have also found weakening of entanglement for other cases. Thus, non-conserving magnetization offers a broad opportunity to manipulate the entanglement by means of magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: non-universality in the scaling region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$ block) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, "logarithmic divergences" and non-universal short distance contributions in the Wiener-Hopf factors fail to factorize out completely in the re-scaled correlators. This leads to non-universality of the leading large $r$ asymptotics at the order $\frac {e^{-r}}{r^{\frac{3}{2}}}$, even when the constant terms are re-scaled to be the same.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for efficiently cooling many-body quantum systems with unknown Hamiltonians down to their ground states with a high fidelity. The technique involves initially applying a strong external field followed by a sequence of single-degree-of-freedom (single-qubit) measurements and radiofrequency (RF) pulses to polarize the system along the field direction. Subsequently, the field is adiabatically switched off, allowing the system to evolve towards its ground state as governed by the quantum adiabatic theorem.
  We present numerical simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the technique applied to quantum spin chains with long-range and short-range interactions as prototypes for many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Discrete Time-Crystaline Response on a Superconducting Quantum Computer by increasing the Interaction Range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of complex quantum many-body systems is a promising short-term goal of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the limited connectivity of native qubits hinders the implementation of quantum algorithms that require long-range interactions. We present the outcomes of a digital quantum simulation where we overcome the limitations of the qubit connectivity in NISQ devices. Utilizing the universality of quantum processor native gates, we demonstrate how to implement couplings among physically disconnected qubits at the cost of increasing the circuit depth. We apply this method to simulate a Floquet-driven quantum spin chain featuring interactions beyond nearest neighbors. Specifically, we benchmark the prethermal stabilization of the discrete Floquet time-crystalline response as the interaction range increases, a phenomenon never observed experimentally. Our quantum simulation addresses one of the significant limitations of superconducting quantum processors, namely, device connectivity. It reveals that nontrivial physics involving couplings beyond nearest neighbors can be extracted after the impact of noise is properly taken into account in the theoretical model and consequently mitigated from the experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of $1/f$ noise in electrical conductors based on the drift of individual charge carriers and their interaction with the trapping centers. We assume that the trapping centers are distributed uniformly across the material. The trapping centers are assumed to be heterogeneous and have unique detrapping rates, which are sampled from a uniform distribution. We show that under these assumptions, and if the trapping rate is low in comparison to the maximum detrapping rate, $1/f$ noise in the form of Hooge's relation is recovered. Hooge's parameter is shown to be a ratio between the characteristic trapping rate and the maximum detrapping rate.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Amplification of Quantum Coherence in Asymptotic and Catalytic Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence is one of the fundamental aspects distinguishing classical and quantum theories. Coherence between different energy eigenstates is particularly important, as it serves as a valuable resource under the law of energy conservation. A fundamental question in this setting is how well one can prepare good coherent states from low coherent states and whether a given coherent state is convertible to another one. Here, we show that any low coherent state is convertible to any high coherent state arbitrarily well in two operational settings: asymptotic and catalytic transformations. For a variant of asymptotic coherence manipulation where one aims to prepare desired states in local subsystems, the rate of transformation becomes unbounded regardless of how weak the initial coherence is. In a non-asymptotic transformation with a catalyst, a helper state that locally remains in the original form after the transformation, we show that an arbitrary state can be obtained from any low coherent state. Applying this to the standard asymptotic setting, we find that a catalyst can increase the coherence distillation rate significantly -- from zero to infinite rate. We also prove that such anomalous transformation requires small but non-zero coherence in relevant modes, establishing the condition under which a sharp transition of the operational capability occurs. Our results provide a general characterization of the coherence transformability in these operational settings and showcase their peculiar properties compared to other common resource theories such as entanglement and quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Solvable models for 2+1D quantum critical points: Loop soups of 1+1D conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of solvable models for 2+1D quantum critical points by attaching 1+1D conformal field theories (CFTs) to fluctuating domain walls forming a ``loop soup''. Specifically, our local Hamiltonian attaches gapless spin chains to the domain walls of a triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet. The macroscopic degeneracy between antiferromagnetic configurations is split by the Casimir energy of each decorating CFT, which is usually negative and thus favors a short loop phase with a finite gap. However, we found a set of 1D CFT Hamiltonians for which the Casimir energy is effectively positive, making it favorable for domain walls to coalesce into a single ``snake'' which is macroscopically long and thus hosts a CFT with a vanishing gap. The snake configurations are geometrical objects also known as fully-packed self-avoiding walks or Hamiltonian walks which are described by an $\mathrm{O}(n=0)$ loop ensemble with a non-unitary 2+0D CFT description. Combining this description with the 1+1D decoration CFT, we obtain a 2+1D theory with unusual critical exponents and entanglement properties. Regarding the latter, we show that the $\log$ contributions from the decoration CFTs conspire with the spatial distribution of loops crossing the entanglement cut to generate a ``non-local area law''. Our predictions are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum many-body mixed states with a symmetry from the perspective of separability, i.e., whether a mixed state can be expressed as an ensemble of short-range entangled (SRE) symmetric pure states. We provide evidence for 'symmetry-enforced separability transitions' in a variety of states, where in one regime the mixed state is expressible as a convex sum of symmetric SRE pure states, while in the other regime, such a representation is not feasible. We first discuss Gibbs state of Hamiltonians that exhibit spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry, and argue that the associated thermal phase transition can be thought of as a symmetry-enforced separability transition. Next, we study cluster states in various dimensions subjected to local decoherence, and identify several distinct mixed-state phases and associated separability phase transitions, which also provides an alternate perspective on recently discussed 'average SPT order'. We also study decohered p+ip superconductors, and find that if the decoherence breaks the fermion parity explicitly, then the resulting mixed state can be expressed as a convex sum of non-chiral states, while a fermion-parity preserving decoherence results in a phase transition at a non-zero threshold that corresponds to spontaneous breaking of fermion parity. Finally, we briefly discuss systems that satisfy NLTS (no low-energy trivial state) property, such as the recently discovered good LDPC codes, and argue that the Gibbs state of such systems exhibits a temperature-tuned separability transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) and SU(3) flavor symmetries of staggered fermions in the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian formalism. This type of four-fermion interactions has been widely used for describing low-energy behaviors of strongly interacting quarks as an effective model. In particular, we focus on the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the flavor symmetries. In the strong coupling regime for the interactions, we prove the following: (i) For the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 5$, the SU(3) model shows a long-range order at sufficiently low temperatures. (ii) In the case of the SU(2) symmetry, there appears a long-range order in the spatial dimension $\nu \ge 3$ at sufficiently low temperatures. (iii) These results hold in the ground states as well. (iv) In general, if a long-range order emerges in this type of models, then there appear gapless excitations above the sector of the infinite-volume ground states. These are nothing but the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the global rotational symmetry of flavors. (v) In particular, we establish that the number of the lineraly independent Nambu-Goldstone modes is equal to the number of the broken symmetry generators on the Hilbert space constructed from a certain symmetry-breaking infinite-volume ground state.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Transport Property of Spin-1/2 Random Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quenched disorders can strongly influence the physical properties of quantum many-body systems. The real-space strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) analysis has shown that the spin-1/2 random Heisenberg chain is controlled by the infinite-randomness fixed point (IRFP) and forms a random singlet (RS) ground state. Motivated by recent thermal transport experiments on the quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet copper benzoate [B. Y. Pan et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 167201 (2022)], we adapt the SDRG to study the low-temperature properties of the random Heisenberg chain by assuming that its low-energy excited states are captured by the parent Hamiltonian of the RS ground state as well. We find that while the specific heat coefficient and the uniform magnetic susceptibility scale as $C/T\sim T^{-\alpha_{c}}$ and $\chi\sim T^{-\alpha_{s}}$ with $0&lt;\alpha_{c,s}&lt;1$, indicating a divergent low-energy density of states, the thermal and the spin conductivities scale as $\kappa/T\sim T$ and $\sigma_{s}\sim T$, which implies a vanishing density of extended states in the low-energy limit. We believe that such a disparity in the thermodynamic and transport properties is a common feature of random systems controlled by the IRFP.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity and Dynamical Phase Transition in the quenched LMG model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the time evolution of complexity in quantum systems entails evaluating the spreading of the system's state across a defined basis in its corresponding Hilbert space. Recently, the Krylov basis has been identified as the one that minimizes this spreading. In this study, we develop a numerical exploration of the Krylov complexity in quantum states following a quench in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. Our results reveal that the long-term averaged Krylov complexity acts as an order parameter for this model. It effectively discriminates between the two dynamic phases induced by the quench, sharing a critical point with the conventional order parameter. Additionally, we examine the inverse participation ratio and the Shannon entropy in both the Krylov basis and the energy basis. A matching dynamic behavior is observed in both bases when the initial state possesses a specific symmetry. This behavior is analytically explained by establishing the equivalence between the Krylov basis and the pre-quench energy eigenbasis.</description>

      <title>Random-matrix models of monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the competition between Haar-random unitary dynamics and measurements for unstructured systems of qubits. For projective measurements, we derive various properties of the statistical ensemble of Kraus operators analytically, including the purification time and the distribution of Born probabilities. The latter generalizes the Porter-Thomas distribution for random unitary circuits to the monitored setting and is log-normal at long times. We also consider weak measurements that interpolate between identity quantum channels and projective measurements. In this setting, we derive an exactly solvable Fokker-Planck equation for the joint distribution of singular values of Kraus operators, analogous to the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) equation modelling disordered quantum wires. We expect that the statistical properties of Kraus operators we have established for these simple systems will serve as a model for the entangling phase of monitored quantum systems more generally.</description>

      <title>Phase space path integral approach to the kinetics of black hole phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the approach of path integral in the phase space to study the kinetics of state switching associated with black hole phase transitions. Under the assumption that the state switching process of the black hole is described by the stochastic Langevin equation based on the free energy landscape, we derived the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional and obtained the path integral expression of the transition probability. The MSRJD functional inherently represents the path integral in the phase space, allowing us to extract the effective Hamiltonian for the dynamics of state switching process. By solving the Hamiltonian equations of motion, we obtain the kinetic path in the phase space using an example of the RNAdS black hole. Furthermore, the dominant kinetic path within the configuration space is calculated. We also discuss the kinetic rate by using the functional formalism. Finally, we examine two further examples: Hawking-Page phase transition and Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point. Our analysis demonstrates that, concerning the Hawking-Page phase transition, while a dominant kinetic path in the phase space from the large SAdS black hole to the thermal AdS space is present, there is no kinetic path for the inverse process. For the Gauss-Bonnet black hole phase transition at the triple point, the state switching processes between the small, the intermediate and the large Gauss-Bonnet black holes constitute a chemical reaction cycle.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of $\boldsymbol{(2+1)}$D SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory on Plaquette Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of Hamiltonian SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on linear plaquette chains and show that the entanglement entropies of both ground and excited states follow Page curves. The transition of the subsystem size dependence of the entanglement entropy from the area law for the ground state to the volume law for highly excited states is found to be described by a universal crossover function. Quantum many-body scars in the middle of the spectrum, which are present in the electric flux truncated Hilbert space, where the gauge theory can be mapped onto an Ising model, disappear when higher electric field representations are included in the Hilbert space basis. This suggests the continuum $(2+1)$-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory does not have such scarred states.</description>

Abstract: The Schwinger model describes quantum electrodynamics in 1+1-dimensions, it is a prototype for quantum chromodynamics, and its lattice version allows for a quantum link model description that can be simulated using modern quantum devices. In this work, we devise quantum simulations to investigate the dynamics of this model in its low dimensional form, where the gauge field degrees of freedom are described by spin 1/2 operators. We apply trotterization to write quantum circuits that effectively generate the evolution under the Schwinger model Hamiltonian. We consider both sequential circuits, with a fixed gate sequence, and randomized ones. Utilizing the correspondence between the Schwinger model and the PXP model, known for its quantum scars, we investigate the presence of quantum scar states in the Schwinger model by identifying states exhibiting extended thermalization times in our circuit evolutions. Our comparison of sequential and randomized circuit dynamics shows that the non-thermal sector of the Hilbert space, including the scars, are more sensitive to randomization.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Microscopy: Tomography and Entanglement Measures via Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to obtain the full reduced density matrix associated with subregions in quantum Monte Carlo simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading of Conditional Mutual Information in Noisy Random Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of conditional mutual information in generic open quantum systems, focusing on one-dimensional random circuits with interspersed local noise. Unlike in noiseless circuits, where conditional mutual information spreads linearly while being bounded by the lightcone, we find that noisy random circuits with an error rate $p$ exhibit superlinear propagation of conditional mutual information, which diverges far beyond the lightcone at a critical circuit depth $t_c \propto p^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the underlying mechanism for such rapid spreading is the combined effect of local noise and a scrambling unitary, which selectively removes short-range correlations while preserving long-range correlations. To analytically capture the dynamics of conditional mutual information in noisy random circuits, we introduce a coarse-graining method, and we validate our theoretical results through numerical simulations. Furthermore, we identify a universal scaling law governing the spreading of conditional mutual information.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched. However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response, including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.</description>
