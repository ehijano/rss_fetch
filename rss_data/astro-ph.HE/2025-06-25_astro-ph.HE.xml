      <title>Towards Modelling AR Sco: Calibration -- Reproducing High-Energy Pulsar Emission and Testing Convergence to Aristotelian Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, kinetic simulations have been crucial to further our understanding of pulsar electrodynamics. Yet, due to the large-scale separation between the gyro-period vs the stellar rotation period, resolving the particle gyration has been computationally unfeasible for realistic pulsar parameters. The main aim of this work is comparing our gyro-phase-resolved model with a gyro-centric pulsar model, where our model solves the general equations of motion with included radiation reaction using a higher-order numerical solver with adaptive time steps. Specifically, we aim to (i) reproduce a pulsar's high-energy emission maps, namely one with $10\%$ the surface $B$-field strength of Vela, and spectra produced by an independent gyro-centric pulsar emission model; (ii) test convergence of these results to the radiation-reaction limit of Aristotelian Electrodynamics. (iii) Additionally, we identify the effect that a large $E_{\parallel}$-field has on the trajectories and radiation calculations. We find that we can reproduce the curvature radiation emission maps and spectra well, using $10\%$ field strengths of the Vela pulsar and injecting our particles at a higher altitude in the magnetosphere. Using sufficiently large $E_{\parallel}$-fields, our numeric results converge to the analytic radiation-reaction limit trajectories. Additionally, we illustrate the importance of accounting for the $\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$-drift in the particle trajectories and radiation calculations, validating the Harding and collaborators' model approach. Lastly, we found that our model deals very well with the high-radiation-reaction and high-field regimes present in pulsars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Configurations in Binary Neutron Star Mergers I: Post-merger Remnant and Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed with the code GR-Athena++. We investigate how a different initial magnetic field configuration, nuclear equation of state, or binary mass ratio affects the magnetic and thermodynamic evolution of the post-merger remnant and disk. We also analyze the impact of the commonly-assumed reflection (bitant) symmetry across the equatorial plane. Magnetic field amplification occurs shortly after the merger due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; later, the field keeps evolving with a predominantly toroidal configuration due to winding and turbulence. The initial magnetic field topology leaves an imprint on the field structure and affects magnetic field amplification for the initial magnetic field values commonly assumed in the literature and the limited resolution of the simulations. Enforcing equatorial reflection symmetry partially suppresses the development of turbulence near the equatorial plane and impacts the post-merger magnetic field evolution. Stiffer EOSs produce larger, less compact remnants that may retain memory of the pre-merger strong poloidal field.</description>

      <title>FRB 20250316A: A Brilliant and Nearby One-Off Fast Radio Burst Localized to 13 parsec Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise localizations of a small number of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have enabled multiwavelength follow-up observations revealing diverse local environments. However, the 2--3\% of FRB sources that are observed to repeat may not be representative of the full population. Here we use the VLBI capabilities of the full CHIME Outriggers array for the first time to localize a nearby (40 Mpc), bright (kJy), and apparently one-off FRB source, FRB 20250316A, to its environment on 13-pc scales. We use optical and radio observations to place deep constraints on associated transient emission and the properties of its local environment. We place a $5\sigma$ upper limit of $L_{\mathrm{9.9~\mathrm{GHz}}} &lt; 2.1\times10^{25}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}~Hz^{-1}}$ on spatially coincident radio emission, a factor of 100 lower than any known compact persistent radio source associated with an FRB. Our KCWI observations allow us to characterize the gas density, metallicity, nature of gas ionization, dust extinction and star-formation rate through emission line fluxes. We leverage the exceptional brightness and proximity of this source to place deep constraints on the repetition of FRB 20250316A, and find it is inconsistent with all well-studied repeaters given the non-detection of bursts at lower spectral energies. We explore the implications of a measured offset of 190$\pm20$ pc from the center of the nearest star-formation region, in the context of progenitor channels. FRB 20250316A marks the beginning of an era of routine localizations for one-off FRBs on tens of mas-scales, enabling large-scale studies of their local environments.</description>

      <title>James Webb Space Telescope Observations of the Nearby and Precisely-Localized FRB 20250316A: A Potential Near-IR Counterpart and Implications for the Progenitors of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep James Webb Space Telescope near-infrared imaging to search for a quiescent or transient counterpart to FRB 20250316A, which was precisely localized with the CHIME/FRB Outriggers array to an area of $11\times13$ pc in the outer regions of NGC 4141 at $d\approx40$ Mpc. Our F150W2 image reveals a faint source near the center of the FRB localization region ("NIR-1"; $M_{\rm F150W2}\approx-2.5$ mag; probability of chance coincidence $\approx0.36$), the only source within $\approx2.7\sigma$. We find that it is too faint to be a globular cluster, young star cluster, red supergiant star, or a giant star near the tip of the red giant branch (RGB). It is instead consistent with a red giant near the RGB "clump" or a massive ($\gtrsim20$ M$_{\odot}$) main sequence star, although the latter explanation is less likely. The source is too bright to be a supernova remnant, Crab-like pulsar wind nebula, or isolated magnetar. Alternatively, NIR-1 may represent transient emission, namely a dust echo from an energetic outburst associated with the FRB, in which case we would expect it to fade in future observations. We explore the stellar population near the FRB and find that it is composed of a mix of young massive stars ($\sim10-100$ Myr) in a nearby HII region that extends to the location of FRB 20250316A, and old evolved stars ($\gtrsim$ Gyr). The overlap with a young stellar population, containing stars of up to $\approx20$ M$_\odot$, may implicate a neutron star / magnetar produced in the core collapse of a massive star as the source of FRB 20250316A.</description>

      <title>A Late-time Radio Survey of Type Ia-CSM Supernovae with the Very Large Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia-CSM supernovae (SNe) are a rare and peculiar subclass of thermonuclear SNe characterized by emission lines of hydrogen or helium, indicative of a high-density circumstellar medium (CSM). Their implied mass-loss rates of $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (assuming $\mathrm{ \sim 100 \ km\ s^{-1}}$ winds) from optical observations are generally in excess of values observed in realistic SN Ia progenitors. In this paper, we present an independent study of CSM densities around a sample of 29 archival Ia-CSM SNe using radio observations with the Very Large Array at 6 GHz. Motivated by the late ($\sim$2 yr) radio detection of the Ia-CSM SN 2020eyj, we observed old ($&gt;$1 yr) SNe where we are more likely to see the emergent synchrotron emission that may have been suppressed earlier by free-free absorption by the CSM. We do not detect radio emission down to 3$\sigma$ limits of $\sim$35 $\mu$Jy in our sample. The only radio-detected candidate in our sample, SN 2022esa, was likely mis-classified as a Ia-CSM with early spectra, and appears more consistent with a peculiar Ic based on later-epochs. Assuming a wind-like CSM with temperatures between $2 \times 10^4$ K and $10^5$ K, and magnetic field-to-shock energy fraction ($\epsilon_B$) = $0.01-0.1$, the radio upper limits rule out mass-loss rates between $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (100 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. This is somewhat in tension with the estimates from optical observations, and may indicate that more complex CSM geometries and/or lower values of $\epsilon_B$ may be present.</description>

      <title>Searching for radio pulsars in old open clusters from the Parkes archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of a pulsar in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791, we conducted a search for radio pulsars in archival Parkes observations targeting similar old open clusters. We reprocessed 224 observations totalling 75.02 hours from four clusters: Theia 1661, NGC 6259, Pismis 3, and Trumpler 20. Our analysis identified five known pulsars and three new rotating radio transient (RRAT) candidates. By comparing the measured dispersion measures (DMs) with the expected DM values for each cluster derived from YMW16 and NE2001 models, we conclude that most detected sources are likely background pulsars. However, RRAT J1749-25 in Theia 1661 and RRAT J1237-60 in Trumpler 20 have DMs reasonably close to their respective clusters, suggesting possible membership. The association between PSR J1750-2536 and Theia 1661 remains ambiguous due to its intermediate DM. These candidate cluster-associated neutron stars warrant follow-up with more sensitive telescopes such as MeerKAT or the SKA, potentially offering valuable insights into neutron star retention mechanisms and evolution in open cluster environments.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic oscillations and reflection feature evolution in 4U 1630-47 observed with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 went into a new outburst in 2021 after $\sim$ 600 days from its 2020 outburst. We perform a detailed analysis of quasi-periodic oscillations and spectral evolutions during its 2021 outburst based on \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations. The main science aims to study the reflection features evolution of this accreting black hole using the observations of detecting quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and quasi-regular modulations (QRMs). The QPOs frequencies evolve from $\sim 1.6 - 3.6$ Hz, and QRMs have low frequencies around 0.05 - 0.07 Hz. The reflection fraction varies during the outburst and has a positive correlation with the hardness ratio when QPOs are detected. The centroid frequency of QPOs is anti-correlated to the reflection fraction. This is consistent with the prediction of precessing inner flow model and provides evidence for a geometrical origin of QPOs. The centroid frequency of QRMs also shows an anti-correlation to the reflection fraction, but the hardness ratio shows no relation to the reflection fraction during the period. We suggest that QRMs may have a different origin from QPOs and be caused by instabilities in the corona.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.</description>

      <title>Birthplaces of X-ray emission lines in Cygnus X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of X-ray emission lines in the wind of the Wolf-Rayet (WR) companion in Cyg X-3 by analyzing their orbital dynamics using Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating (HEG) observations during a hypersoft state. Our goal is to constrain the X-ray transparency of the recently discovered funnel-like structure surrounding the compact star, as revealed by X-ray polarimetry. All lines exhibit sinusoidal orbital modulation, with the velocity amplitude generally increasing and the orbital phase with the highest blueshift generally decreasing for ions with a higher ionisation potential. The {Fe}{xxvi}-line displays velocity extremes at phase 0.25 (blueshift) and 0.75 (redshift), indicating that the line-emitting region is close to the compact component (disc or corona) and thus reflects the orbital motion. The {Fe}{xxv}-line shows a complex behaviour that cannot be fully resolved with the Chandra/HEG resolution. Other lines display velocity extremes scattered around phase 0.5 (blueshift) and 0.0 (redshift), with velocity amplitudes of 100--300 km/s, suggesting their origin in the WR stellar wind between the two components along 3D \xi-surfaces. Parts of the emission lines of {Ar}{xviii} and {Ca}{xx} originated around the compact star (disc or corona). The recent polarisation funnel-modelling is consistent with the present results during the hypersoft state.</description>

      <title>Elemental Abundances in X-ray Binary Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line resolved X-ray spectra of outflows from X-ray binaries are interesting since they provide quantifiable measures of the accreted material on to the compact object (black hole or neutron star), which can not be observed directly in the accretion disk. One such measurement that has been largely overlooked is that of the elemental abundances, which potentially provide insights into the origin of the ejected material. Using the Chandra/HETG grating spectrometer we measure and present elemental abundances in four low-mass X-ray binaries. We compare two measurement methods. One is by fitting line series of individual ions and reconstructing the absorption measure distribution (AMD), and the other is a global fit with one or two individual ionization components. All outflows feature a steep AMD strongly favoring high ionization degrees. The present abundances are consistent with previous works suggesting the abundances in the outflows are non-solar. We find a tentative trend of increasing abundances with atomic number, which fits some core-collapse supernova models, but no exact match to a specific one.</description>

      <title>The Crab Nebula at subarcsecond resolution with the International LOFAR Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present International LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Telescope (ILT) observations of the Crab Nebula, the remnant of a core-collapse supernova explosion observed by astronomers in 1054. The field of the Crab Nebula was observed between 120 and 168 MHz as part of the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), and the data were re-processed to include the LOFAR international stations to create a high angular resolution ($0.43'' \times 0.28''$) map at a central frequency of 145 MHz. Combining the ILT map with archival centimeter-range observations of the Nebula with the Very Large Array (VLA) and LOFAR data at 54 MHz, we become sensitive to the effects of free-free absorption against the synchrotron emission of the pulsar wind nebula. This absorption is caused by the ionised filaments visible in optical and infrared data of the Crab Nebula, which are the result of the pulsar wind nebula expanding into the denser stellar ejecta that surrounds it and forming Rayleigh-Taylor fingers. The LOFAR observations are sensitive to two components of these filaments: their dense cores, which show electron densities of $\gtrsim1,000$ cm$^{-3}$, and the diffuse envelopes, with electron densities of $\sim50-250$ cm$^{-3}$. The denser structures have widths of $\sim0.03$ pc, whereas the diffuse component is at one point as large as $0.2$ pc. The morphology of the two components is not always the same. These finding suggests that the layered temperature, density, and ionisation structure of the Crab optical filaments extends to larger scales than previously considered.</description>

      <title>BRAiSE: synthetic polarisation in RMHD AGN jet simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to calculate the polarised synchrotron emission of radio AGN sources using magnetic field information from 3-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations. Like its predecessor, which uses pressure as a proxy for the magnetic field, this method tracks the spatially resolved adiabatic and radiative loss processes using the method adapted from the Radio AGN in Semi-analytic Environments formalism. Lagrangian tracer particles in RMHD simulations carried out using the PLUTO code are used to track the fluid quantities of each `ensemble of electrons' through time to calculate the radio emissivity ex-situ. By using the magnetic field directly from simulations, the full set of linear Stokes parameters I, Q, and U can be calculated to study the synthetic radio polarisation of radio AGN sources. We apply this method to a suite of RMHD simulations to study their polarisation properties. The turbulent magnetic field present in radio lobes influences the emission, causing a complex clumpy structure that is visible at high resolution. Our synthetic polarisation properties are consistent with observations; we find that the fractional polarisation is highest (approximately 50 percent) at the lobe edges. We show that for the same source, the integrated and mean fractional polarisation depends on viewing angle to the source. At oblique viewing angles the behaviour of the integrated and mean fractional polarisation over time depends on the morphology of the jet cocoon. Using Faraday rotation measures, we reproduce known depolarisation effects such as the Laing-Garrington depolarisation asymmetry in jets angled to the line of sight. We show that the hotspots and hence the Fanaroff-Riley classification become less clear with our new, more accurate method.</description>

      <title>A deep X-ray/UV look into the reflaring stage of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed X-ray/UV high-time resolution monitoring of the final reflaring phase of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX~J1808.4$-$3658. During its 2022 outburst, we obtained simultaneous XMM-Newton and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. We detected coherent X-ray pulsations down to a 0.5-10~keV luminosity of $L_{X(low)\,0.5-10} \simeq 6.21^{+0.20}_{-0.15} \times 10^{34} \, d^2_{3.5}\,\mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$, among the lowest ever observed in this source. The uninterrupted coverage provided by XMM-Newton enabled a detailed characterisation of the spectral and temporal evolution of the source X-ray emission as the flux varied by approximately one order of magnitude. At the lowest flux levels, we observed significant variations in pulse amplitude and phase correlated with the X-ray source flux. We found a sharp phase jump of $\sim 0.4$ cycles, accompanied by a doubling of the pulse amplitude and a softening of the X-ray emission. We interpret the changes in the X-ray pulse profiles as drifts of emission regions on the neutron star surface due to an increase of the inner disk radius occurring when the mass accretion rate decreases. The phase evolution was consistent with a magnetospheric radius scaling as $R_{m} \propto \dot{M}^{\Lambda}$, with $\Lambda = -0.17(9)$, in broad agreement with theoretical predictions. Simultaneous HST observations confirmed the presence of significant UV pulsations. The measured pulsed luminosity $-$ $L_{pulsed}^{UV} = (9 \pm 2) \times 10^{31} \, \text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1}$ $-$ was approximately half that observed during the 2019 outburst, but the pulsed X-ray to UV luminosity ratio simultaneously measured remained consistent. Yet, such a UV luminosity exceeds the predictions of standard emission models, as further confirmed by the shape of the pulsed spectral energy distribution.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a 0.8-mHz quasi-periodic oscillations in the transient X-ray pulsar SXP31.0 and associated timing transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first broad-band spectral and timing study of the Be/X-ray pulsar XTE J0111.2$-$7317 (SXP31.0) during its first major outburst since its discovery in 1998. This giant Type II outburst, observed in April-June 2025, marks the source's return to activity after nearly three decades of quiescence. Utilizing our NuSTAR observations together with Swift/XRT and SRG/ART-XC ones, we trace the evolution of the outburst to a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = 3.6 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The broadband spectra are well described by an absorbed cutoff power law, two blackbody components (hot and soft), and a narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line. No cyclotron absorption features are detected in either the phase-averaged or phase-resolved spectra in the 5-50 keV band. Most notably, we report the discovery of a previously undetected quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at $0.8 \pm 0.1$ mHz, characterized by a fractional root-mean-square amplitude of 18% at a super-Eddington bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = 2.5 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In contrast, the previously reported 1.27 Hz QPO is not detected. While the sub-mHz QPO is present, the pulsed fraction (PF) is low in soft X-rays, consistent with other super-Eddington pulsars exhibiting mHz QPOs, but rises above 20 keV reaching 35%. The QPO vanishes in subsequent observations coinciding with a sharp increase in the PF and a distinct change in pulse profile morphology. It is not observed in any follow-up observations at luminosities above or below its initial detection, suggesting it is a transient phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from airplanes as observed with RNO-G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes how intentional and unintentional radio emission from airplanes is recorded with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G). We characterize the received signals and define a procedure to extract a clean set of impulsive signals. These signals are highly suitable for instrument calibration, also for future experiments. A set of signals is used to probe the timing precision of RNO-G in-situ, which is found to match expectations. We also discuss the impact of these signals on the ability to detect neutrinos with RNO-G.</description>

      <title>Validating Sequential Monte Carlo for Gravitational-Wave Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nested sampling (NS) is the preferred stochastic sampling algorithm for gravitational-wave inference for compact binary coalenscences (CBCs). It can handle the complex nature of the gravitational-wave likelihood surface and provides an estimate of the Bayesian model evidence. However, there is another class of algorithms that meets the same requirements but has not been used for gravitational-wave analyses: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), an extension of importance sampling that maps samples from an initial density to a target density via a series of intermediate densities. In this work, we validate a type of SMC algorithm, called persistent sampling (PS), for gravitational-wave inference. We consider a range of different scenarios including binary black holes (BBHs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs) and real and simulated data and show that PS produces results that are consistent with NS whilst being, on average, 2 times more efficient and 2.74 times faster. This demonstrates that PS is a viable alternative to NS that should be considered for future gravitational-wave analyses.</description>

      <title>What drives the growth of black holes: a decade of progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed significant progress in our understanding of the growth of super-massive black holes (SMBHs). It is now clear that an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN: the observed manifestation of a growing SMBH) is an "event" within the broader lifecycle of a galaxy, which can significantly influence the shape and evolution of the galaxy itself. Our view of the obscuring medium that affects the observed properties of an AGN has also undergone a revolution, and we now have a more physical understanding of the connection between the fuelling of (and feedback from) the SMBH and the broader host-galaxy and larger-scale environment. We have a greater understanding of the physics of SMBH accretion, can identify AGNs out to z = 8-10 witnessing the very earliest phases of SMBH growth, and have a more complete census of AGN activity than ever before. This great progress has been enabled by new innovative facilities, an ever-increasing quantity of multi-wavelength data, the exploitation and development of new techniques, and greater community-wide engagement. In this article we review our understanding of AGNs and the growth of SMBHs, providing an update of the earlier Alexander and Hickox (2012) review. Using citation-network analyses we also show where this review fits within the broader black-hole research literature and, adopting the previous article as a snapshot of the field over a decade ago, identify the drivers that have enabled the greatest scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the mean number of muons with energies above 500 GeV in air showers detected with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the mean number of muons with energies larger than 500 GeV in near-vertical extensive air showers initiated by cosmic rays with primary energies between 2.5 PeV and 100 PeV. The measurement is based on events detected in coincidence between the surface and in-ice detectors of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Air showers are recorded on the surface by IceTop, while a bundle of high-energy muons ("TeV muons") from the shower can subsequently produce a track-like event in the IceCube in-ice array. Results are obtained assuming the hadronic interaction models Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC. The measured number of TeV muons is found to be in agreement with predictions from air-shower simulations. The results have also been compared to a measurement of low-energy muons by IceTop, indicating an inconsistency between the predictions for low- and high-energy muons in simulations based on the EPOS-LHC model.</description>

      <title>Searching for stars ejected from the Galactic Centre in DESI</title>

Abstract: Dynamical interactions between stars and the super massive black hole Sgr A* at the Galactic Centre (GC) may eject stars into the Galactic halo. While recent fast ejections by Sgr A* have been identified in the form of hypervelocity stars (hundreds to thousands km/s), it is also expected that the stellar halo contains slower stars, ejected over the last few billion years. In this study, we use the first data release of DESI to search for these slower GC ejecta, which are expected to stand out from the stellar halo population for their combined high metallicity (${\rm [Fe/H]}\gtrsim0$) and small values of their vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$), whose distribution should peak at zero. Our search does not yield a detection, but allows us to place an upper limit on the ejection rate of stars from the GC of $\sim2.8\times10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ over the past ~5 Gyr, which is ejection model independent. This implies that our result can be used to put constraints on different ejection models, including that invoking mergers of Sgr A* with other massive black holes in the last last few billion years.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in the Red-sequence Elliptical Galaxies at Redshifts $\sim 0.7-2.5$: Not Dark Energy Source but Remanants of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmology. One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\leq 2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$\sigma$. Moreover, it turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the redshifts of $\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological coupling.</description>

      <title>Marginally stable Schwarzschild-black-hole-non-minimally-coupled-Proca-field bound-state configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been revealed that, in curved black-hole spacetimes, non-minimally coupled massive Proca fields may be characterized by the existence of poles in their linearized perturbation equations and may therefore develop exponentially growing instabilities. Interestingly, recent numerical computations [H. W. Chiang, S. Garcia-Saenz, and A. Sang, arXiv:2504.04779] have provided compelling evidence that the onset of monopole instabilities in the composed black-hole-field system is controlled by the dimensionless physical parameter $\mu r_-$, where $\mu$ is the proper mass of the non-minimally coupled Proca field and $r_-\equiv (-2\alpha)^{1/3}r_{\text{H}}$ is the radial location of the pole [here $\alpha$ is the non-minimal coupling parameter of the Einstein-Proca theory and $r_{\text{H}}$ is the radius of the black-hole horizon]. In the present paper we use {\it analytical} techniques in order to explore the physical properties of critical (marginally-stable) composed Schwarzschild-black-hole-nonminimally-coupled-monopole-Proca-field configurations. In particular, we derive a remarkably compact analytical formula for the discrete spectrum $\{\mu(r_{\text{H}},r_-;n) \}^{n=\infty}_{n=1}$ of Proca field masses which characterize the critical black-hole-monopole-Proca-field configurations in the dimensionless regime ${{r_- -r_{\text{H}}}\over{r_{\text{H}}}}\ll1$ of near-horizon poles. The physical significance of the analytically derived resonance spectrum stems from the fact that the critical field mass $\mu_{\text{c}}\equiv\mu(r_{\text{H}},r_-;n=1)$ marks the onset of instabilities in the Schwarzschild-black-hole-nonminimally-coupled-monopole-Proca-field system. In particular, composed black-hole-linearized-Proca-field configurations in the small-mass regime $\mu\leq\mu_{\text{c}}$ of the Proca field are stable.</description>

      <title>Two-Component gamma-ray Emission Spectrum and X-Ray Polarization of the Radio Galaxy Pictor A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pictor A is a $\gamma$-ray emitting radio galaxy and has a bright hotspot called WHS, located $\sim$4 arcmin away from the nucleus. In this work, we present an analysis of its 16-year Fermi-LAT data and report the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations for this source. Our analysis of the Fermi-LAT observations reveals evidence of two components in the average $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Pictor A, exhibiting a statistically significant hardening from $\Gamma_{\rm \gamma,1}=3.25\pm0.15$ to $\Gamma_{\rm \gamma,2}=1.81\pm0.07$ at a break energy of $2.46\pm0.09$ GeV. Notably, variability of $\gamma$-rays is evident in Pictor A, predominantly driven by the component below the break energy, while the component above the break energy remains stable. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that a power-law function provides an adequate fit for the high-flux-state spectrum, while a broken power-law function remains necessary to accurately model the low-flux-state spectrum. We suggest that the low-energy component originates from the nucleus, while the high-energy component primarily stems from WHS. The broadband spectral energy distributions of both nucleus and WHS can be well represented by a simple leptonic model, with both $\gamma$-ray components attributed to the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) process. Analysis of IXPE data provides upper limits on the polarization degree of $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;$6.6\% for the nucleus and $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;$56.4\% for the WHS within the 2--8 keV band. For the nucleus, this result aligns with X-ray emission originating from the SSC process. However, the upper limit of $\Pi_{\rm X}&lt;$56.4\% for WHS is insufficient to conclusively determine the X-ray emission mechanism in this region.</description>

      <title>Fermi detection of gamma-ray Emission from the Hot Coronae of Radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are well-known powerful $\gamma$-ray emitters. In absence of the jets in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), how the SMBHs work in $\gamma$-ray bands is still unknown despite of great observational efforts made in the last 3 decades. Considering the previous efforts, we carefully select an AGN sample composed of 37 nearby Seyfert galaxies with ultra-hard X-rays for the goals of $\gamma$-ray detections by excluding all potential contamination in this band. Adopting a stacking technique, here we report the significant $\gamma$-ray detection (${\rm TS}=30.6$, or $5.2\,\sigma$) from the sample using 15-year Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observation. We find an average $\gamma$-ray luminosity of the sample as $(1.5\pm1.0)\times10^{40}{\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ at energies from 1-300\,GeV. Limited by the well-known pair production from the interaction of $\gamma$-rays with low energy photons, $\gtrsim$ several GeV $\gamma$-rays are found to originate from an extended corona ($\sim 2.7\times 10^6\,R_{\rm g}$), whereas the canonical much more compact X-ray corona ($\sim 10\,R_{\rm g}$) is responsible for 1 to several GeV $\gamma$-rays. The finding of the compact region lends to strong supports to the long-time theoretical expectations, but the extended corona is beyond all the existing models. One promising scenario is that the electron-positron pairs produced in the compact X-ray corona would expand as fireball, similar to that in $\gamma$-ray bursts, forming the structure of extended corona.</description>

      <title>Predicted Neutrino Signal Features of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the neutrino signals from 24 initially non-rotating, three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations carried to late times. We find that not only does the neutrino luminosity signal encode information about each stage of the CCSN process, but that the monotonic dependence of the luminosity peak height with compactness enables one to infer the progenitor core structure from the neutrino signal. We highlight a systematic relationship between the luminosity peak height with its timing. Additionally, we emphasize that the total energy radiated in neutrinos is monotonic with progenitor compactness, and that the mean neutrino energy contains a unique spiral SASI signature for nonexploding, BH-forming models. We also find that neutrino emissions are not isotropic and that the anisotropy increases roughly with progenitor compactness. To assess the detectability of these neutrino signal features, we provide examples of the event rates for our models for the JUNO, DUNE, SK, and IceCube detectors using the SNEWPY software, and find that many of the trends in the luminosity signal can be detectable across several detectors and oscillation models. Finally, we discuss correlations between the radiated neutrino energy and the evolution of the gravitational-wave f-mode.</description>

      <title>IGR J12580+0134: The Nearest Tidal Disruption Event and its Faint Resurrection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are X-ray and gamma-ray radiations emerging from the tidal disintegration of a star or substellar object that passes too close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy. In November 2010, a TDE designated as IGR J12580+0134 occurred in the galaxy NGC 4845, and it was traced by follow-up XMM-Newton observations in January 2011. To identify a further TDE based on the radio outburst cycle, we requested NICER monitoring observations for nearly a year beginning in March 2023, which we studied here along with the previous XMM-Newton observations. We analyzed X-ray brightness changes using hardness analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), and conducted spectral analysis of the source continuum. The NICER observations revealed the presence of some X-ray flares during March-June 2023 that were much fainter than the TDE observed using XMM-Newton in 2011. The PCA component that mainly contributes to the X-ray outbursts during the TDE is a heavily absorbed power-law continuum emission, whereas there is a small contribution from collisionally ionized plasma in the soft excess, likely from a colliding wind or jet. Similarly, the PCA of the NICER data relates the X-ray flares to a power-law spectrum, albeit with a much lower absorbing column, and partially to soft collisional plasma. The faint X-ray flares captured by NICER could be associated with extremely weak accretion onto the SMBH resident in this galaxy and thus potentially a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>The Vela pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula Vela-X using 13 years of Fermi-LAT Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of more than 13 years of Fermi-LAT data analysis for the Vela pulsar from 60 MeV to 100 GeV and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN), Vela-X, for E &gt; 1 GeV in the off-pulse phases. We find the Vela-X PWN can be best characterized using two extended components: a large radial Gaussian accompanied by an off-set, compact radial disk, both with a similar spectral index, \Gamma \sim 2.3. The common spectral properties support a common PWN origin, but a supernova remnant component is plausible for the compact radial disk. With an updated Vela-X model, the phase resolved spectral properties of the Vela pulsar are explored through a phase-resolved analysis. The phase-resolved spectral properties of the pulsar are presented, such as the SED peak energy E$_p$, the width of the SED at its peak, d$_p$, and the asymptotic (low-energy) spectral index, $\Gamma_0$, are presented. The best-fit spectral models for each LAT pulse peak (Peak 1 and Peak 2) are extrapolated to UV energies and compared to archival, phase-resolved spectra at UV, X-ray, soft \gamma-ray and TeV energies. We also discuss the physical implications of our modeling and the data comparisons.</description>

We go beyond the state-of-the-art by combining first principle lattice results and effective field theory approaches to infer essential information about the non-perturbative dark deconfinement phase transition driving the generation of gravitational-waves in the early universe, such as the order, duration and energy budget of the phase transition which are essential in establishing the strength of the resulting gravitational-wave signal.</description>

      <title>Limits on Early Matter Domination from the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cosmologies with hidden sector dark matter, the lightest hidden sector species can come to dominate the energy budget of the universe and cause an early matter-dominated era (EMDE). EMDEs amplify the matter power spectrum on small scales, leading to dense, early-forming microhalos which massively boost the dark matter annihilation signal. We use the Fermi-LAT measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background to place limits on the parameter space of hidden sector models with EMDEs. We calculate the amplified annihilation signal by sampling the properties of prompt cusps, which reside at the centers of these microhalos and dominate the signal on account of their steep $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ density profiles. We also include the portions of the parameter space affected by the gravitational heating that arises from the formation and subsequent destruction of nonlinear structure during the EMDE. We are able to rule out significant portions of the parameter space, particularly at high reheat temperatures. Long EMDEs remain poorly constrained despite large structure-induced boosts to the annihilation signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, neutrino astronomy has emerged as a new window into the extreme and hidden universe. Current-generation experiments have detected high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin and identified the first sources, opening the field to discovery. Looking ahead, the authors of this Perspective identify seven major open questions in neutrino astrophysics and particle physics that could lead to transformative discoveries over the next 20 years. These multidisciplinary questions range from understanding the vicinity of a black hole to unveiling the nature of neutrino mass, among other topics. Additionally, we critically review the current experimental capabilities and their limitations and, from there, discuss the interplay between different proposed neutrino telescope technologies and analysis techniques. The authors firmly believe that achieving the immense discovery potential over the next two decades demands a model of global partnership and specialized, complementary detectors. This collaborative neutrino telescope network will pave the way for a thriving multimessenger era, transforming our understanding of neutrino physics, astrophysics, and the extreme universe.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars with large quark cores within the parity doublet model and modified NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the parity doublet model (PDM) for hadronic matter and a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter, we investigate the potential existence of two- and three-flavor quark matter in neutron star cores. Both models respect chiral symmetry, and a sharp first-order phase transition is implemented via Maxwell construction. We find stable neutron stars with quark cores within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. Typical neutron stars with masses around $1.4 \ M_\odot$ may possess deconfined quark matter in their centers. The hybrid star scenario with a two-flavor quark core offers enough parameter space to allow the neutron stars with large quark cores exceeding $\sim 1\ M_\odot$, and allow the early deconfinement position before $2\ \rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. The observations of gravitational wave event GW170817 suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600\ \rm MeV$ in the PDM for scenarios involving three-flavor quark matter cores. The maximum mass of the hybrid star with a quark core is found to be approximately $2.2\ M_\odot$ for both two- or three-flavor quark matter in their centers.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Subcycling Time Integration with the Einstein Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) with subcycling in time enables different grid levels to advance using their own time steps, ensuring finer grids employ smaller steps for accuracy while coarser grids take larger steps to improve computational efficiency. We present the development, validation, and performance analysis of a subcycling in time algorithm implemented within the CarpetX driver in the Einstein Toolkit framework. This new approach significantly improves upon the previous subcycling implementation in the Carpet driver by achieving higher-order convergence -- fourth order in time instead of second order -- and enhanced scaling performance. The key innovation lies in optimizing the exchange of ghost points at refinement boundaries, limiting it to the same number as those at inter-process boundaries using dense output from coarser levels, thereby reducing computational and communication overhead compared to the implementation in Carpet, which required a larger number of buffer zones.
  To validate the algorithm, we first demonstrate its fourth-order convergence using a scalar wave test. We then apply the algorithm to binary black hole (BBH) simulations, confirming its robustness and accuracy in a realistic astrophysical scenario. The results show excellent agreement with the well-established LazEv code. Scaling tests on CPU (Frontera) and GPU (Vista) clusters reveal significant performance gains, with the new implementation achieving improved speed and scalability compared to the Carpet-based version.</description>

      <title>Horizons, throats and bounces in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with a non-zero potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work conducts an in-depth exploration of exact electrically charged solutions, including traversable wormholes, black holes, and black bounces, within the framework of the scalar-tensor representation of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) with a non-zero scalar potential. By integrating principles from both the metric and Palatini formulations, HMPG provides a flexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity (GR), such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter. Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, we employ an inverse problem technique to derive exact solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. This method naturally leads to configurations involving either canonical or phantom scalar fields. A thorough examination of horizon structures, throat conditions, asymptotic behaviour, and curvature regularity (via the Kretschmann scalar) reveals the intricate causal structures permitted by this theoretical model. The analysis uncovers a diverse range of geometric configurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of solutions than the canonical case. These solutions encompass traversable wormholes, black universe models, where the interior of a black hole evolves into an expanding cosmological phase rather than a singularity, as well as black bounce structures and multi-horizon black holes. The results demonstrate that introducing a non-zero scalar potential within HMPG significantly expands the array of possible gravitational solutions, yielding complex causal and curvature properties that go beyond standard GR. Consequently, HMPG stands out as a powerful theoretical framework for modelling extreme astrophysical environments, where deviations from classical gravity are expected to play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>
