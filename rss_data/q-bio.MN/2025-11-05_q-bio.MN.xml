      <title>Biological Regulatory Network Inference through Circular Causal Structure Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological networks are pivotal in deciphering the complexity and functionality of biological systems. Causal inference, which focuses on determining the directionality and strength of interactions between variables rather than merely relying on correlations, is considered a logical approach for inferring biological networks. Existing methods for causal structure inference typically assume that causal relationships between variables can be represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, this assumption is at odds with the reality of widespread feedback loops in biological systems, making these methods unsuitable for direct use in biological network inference. In this study, we propose a new framework named SCALD (Structural CAusal model for Loop Diagram), which employs a nonlinear structure equation model and a stable feedback loop conditional constraint through continuous optimization to infer causal regulatory relationships under feedback loops. We observe that SCALD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring both transcriptional regulatory networks and signaling transduction networks. SCALD has irreplaceable advantages in identifying feedback regulation. Through transcription factor (TF) perturbation data analysis, we further validate the accuracy and sensitivity of SCALD. Additionally, SCALD facilitates the discovery of previously unknown regulatory relationships, which we have subsequently confirmed through ChIP-seq data analysis. Furthermore, by utilizing SCALD, we infer the key driver genes that facilitate the transformation from colon inflammation to cancer by examining the dynamic changes within regulatory networks during the process.</description>

      <title>Biomolecular LQR under Partial Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a biomolecular Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to investigate the design principles of gene regulatory networks. We show that for fundamental gene regulation network, the bio-controller derived from LQR theory precisely recapitulate natural network motifs, such as auto-regulation and incoherent feedforward loops. This emulation arises from a fundamental principle: the LQR cost function mathematically encodes environmental survival demands, which subsequently drives the selection of both network topology and biochemical parameters. Our work thus establishes a theoretical basis for interpreting biological circuit design, directly linking evolutionary pressures to observable regulatory structures.</description>

      <title>Computational strategies for cross-species knowledge transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research organisms provide invaluable insights into human biology and diseases, serving as essential tools for functional experiments, disease modeling, and drug testing. However, evolutionary divergence between humans and research organisms hinders effective knowledge transfer across species. Here, we review state-of-the-art methods for computationally transferring knowledge across species, primarily focusing on methods that utilize transcriptome data and/or molecular networks. Our review addresses four key areas: (1) transferring disease and gene annotation knowledge across species, (2) identifying functionally equivalent molecular components, (3) inferring equivalent perturbed genes or gene sets, and (4) identifying equivalent cell types. We conclude with an outlook on future directions and several key challenges that remain in cross-species knowledge transfer, including introducing the concept of "agnology" to describe functional equivalence of biological entities, regardless of their evolutionary origins. This concept is becoming pervasive in integrative data-driven models where evolutionary origins of functions can remain unresolved.</description>
