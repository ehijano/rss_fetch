      <title>Using the Difference of the Inclinations of a Pair of Counter-Orbiting Satellites to Measure the Lense-Thirring Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let two test particles A and B revolving about a spinning primary along ideally identical orbits in opposite directions be considered. From the general expressions of the precessions of the orbital inclination induced by the post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic and Newtonian quadrupolar fields of the central object, it turns out that the Lense-Thirring inclination rates of A and B are equal and opposite, while the Newtonian ones due to the primary's oblateness are identical. Thus, the difference of the inclination shifts of the two orbiters would allow, in principle, to cancel out the classical effects by enhancing the general relativistic ones. The conditions affecting the orbital configurations that must be satisfied for this to occur and possible observable consequences in the field of Earth are investigated. In particular, a scenario involving two spacecraft in polar orbits, branded POLAr RElativity Satellites (POLARES) and reminiscent of an earlier proposal by Van Patten and Everitt in the mid-1970s, is considered. A comparison with the ongoing experiment with the LAser GEOdynamics Satellite (LAGEOS) and LAser RElativity Satellite (LARES) 2 is made.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric conductances at the giant planets of the Solar System:a comparative study of ionization sources and the impact of meteoric ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of giant planet magnetospheres is controlled by a complex interplay between their fast rotation, their interaction with the solar wind, and their diverse internal plasma and momentum sources. In the ionosphere, the Hall and Pedersen conductances are two key parameters that regulate the intensity of currents coupling the magnetosphere and the ionosphere, and the rate of angular momentum transfer and power carried by these currents. We perform a comparative study of Hall and Pedersen conductivities and conductances in the four giant planets of our Solar System - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. We use a generic ionospheric model (restraining the studied ions to H3+, CH5+, and meteoric ions) to study the dependence of conductances on the structure and composition of these planets' upper atmospheres and on the main ionization sources (photoionization, ionization by precipitating electrons, and meteoroid ablation). After checking that our model reproduces the conclusions of Nakamura et al. (2022, https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JA030312) at Jupiter, i.e. the contribution of meteoric ions to the height-integrated conductances is non-negligible, we show that this contribution could also be non-negligible at Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, compared with ionization processes caused by precipitating electrons of energies lower than a few keV (typical energies on these planets). However, because of their weaker magnetic field, the conductive layer of these planets is higher than the layer where meteoric ions are mainly produced, limiting their role in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Interplanetary Shocks in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interplanetary shocks are one of the crucial dynamic phenomena in the Heliosphere. They can accelerate particles to high energies, generate plasma waves, and can trigger geomagnetic storms in Earth's magnetosphere, significantly impacting technological infrastructure. In this study, two IP shock events are selected to study the temporal variations of the shock parameters using magnetometer and ion plasma measurements of the STEREO$-$A and B, the Wind, Cluster fleet, and the ACE spacecraft. The shock normal vectors are determined using the minimum variance analysis (MVA) and the magnetic coplanarity methods. During the May 7, 2007, event, the shock parameters and the shock normal direction remain consistent across each spacecraft crossing of the shock. The shock surface appears to be tilted almost the same degree as the Parker spiral, and the driver could be a Co$-$rotating Interaction Region (CIR). During the April 23, 2007 event, the shock parameters do not change significantly except for the shock angle $\theta_{B_{n}}$, however, the shape of the IP shock appears to be twisted along the perpendicular direction to the Sun-Earth line as well. The driver of this rippled shock is Stream Interaction Region (SIR)/CIR as well.</description>
