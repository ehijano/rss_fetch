      <title>Low-degree mod 2 cohomology of classifying spaces of $G_2$-gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simply connected compact simple Lie group and let $\mathcal{G}_k$ denote the gauge group of a principal $G$--bundle over $S^4$ with second Chern class $k\in \pi_4(BG)\cong \mathbb Z$. For $G=G_2$, the $p$--local homotopy types of the gauge groups have been completely classified by Kishimoto--Theriault--Tsutaya and Kameko in terms of the order of the fundamental Samelson product $\langle i_3,1\rangle\in [\Sigma^3G_2,G_2]$.
  In this paper we begin a complementary study of the mod~$2$ cohomology of the classifying spaces $B\mathcal{G}_k(G_2)$. Our goal is to understand the structure of $H^*(B\mathcal{G}_k;\mathbb{F}_2)$ as an unstable module over the mod~$2$ Steenrod algebra in a low range of degrees. Using the evaluation fibration \[ \Omega_0^3 G_2 \longrightarrow B\mathcal{G}_k \xrightarrow{\;\mathrm{ev}\;} BG_2 \] together with Serre and Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequences, we study the Serre spectral sequence \[ H^s(BG_2;H^t(\Omega^3_0G_2)) \Longrightarrow H^{s+t}(B\mathcal{G}_k) \] in total degree $\le 10$. A careful analysis of the homotopy groups of $G_2$ shows that \[ H^j(\Omega^3_0G_2;\mathbb{F}_2)=0\quad\text{for }1\le j\le 4, \qquad H^5(\Omega^3_0G_2;\mathbb{F}_2)\neq 0, \] so the first positive-degree generator of the fibre cohomology occurs in degree $5$. As a consequence, there is a distinguished class \[ u_5\in H^5(\Omega^3_0G_2;\mathbb{F}_2) \] whose only possible Serre differential in total degree $\le 10$ is a $d_6$--differential \[ d_6(u_5) = \varepsilon(k)\,x_6 \] from $u_5$ to the degree-$6$ generator $x_6\in H^6(BG_2;\mathbb{F}_2)$, for a certain scalar $\varepsilon(k)\in\mathbb{F}_2$ depending on the bundle class $k$.</description>

      <title>Delta operation at height 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the delta power operation for morava E-theory of height 2 at the prime 3. The delta power operation was defined using the notion of higher semi additivity by Shachar Carmeli, Tomer M. Schlank and Lior Yanovski. We briefly survey the basic definitions in higher semi-additivity. Using explicit formulas for moduli spaces of elliptic curves and computations done by Y. Zhu for the total power operation we provide an explicit formula for the delta power operation. We obtain the numerical result that the delta operation of a polynomial is a polynomial which can be explained by a certain connection which was described by M. Hopkins, C. Rezk and later N. Stapleton between similar operations and the Hecke action on the functions on the moduli space of elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Higher differentiation via higher formal groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the differentiation problem for Lie $\infty$-groups. Our approach builds on a classical version of Cartier duality which canonically identifies the Hopf algebra of point distributions supported at the identity of a Lie group with the universal enveloping algebra of its Lie algebra. Hence, for Lie $\infty$-groups, we consider simplicial coalgebras of point distributions. To do this properly, we first develop the homotopy theory of pointed formal $\infty$-groupoids within K. Behrend and E. Getzler's framework for higher geometric stacks. These objects are "higher" but not "derived", which is an important distinction for the geometric applications in mind. The second part of our construction relies on a careful analysis of J. Pridham's variation of the Dold-Kan adjunction for cosimplicial algebras. Our main result is a differentiation functor at the level of 1-categories from finite-dimensional Lie $\infty$-groups to finite-type Lie $\infty$-algebras that is homotopically well-behaved, coordinate-free, and explicit yet tractable. In particular, if $G_\bullet$ is a simplicial Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_\bullet$, we prove that the differentiation of its classifying space $\overline{\mathscr{W}}_{\! \bullet}G$ is canonically isomorphic to the dg Lie algebra of normalized chains $N_\ast(\mathfrak{g}_\bullet)$.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$-geometry and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the classical Fisher information metric on statistical models to $L^p$-metrics on various spaces of differential forms or group of diffeomorphisms. Using this new interpretation from information geometry, we derive several new results in geometry on group of diffeomorphisms, symplectic geometry and Teichm\"{u}ller theory. This includes geometry of $\operatorname{Diff}_{-\infty}(\RR)$, similar to that of universal Teichm\"{u}ller space in essence, also a study on the space of all symplectic forms on a symplectic manifold $M$ and a generalization of Gelfand-Fuchs cocycles to higher-dimension. Furthermore, we answer questions in $\alpha$-geometry posed by Gibilisco, and generalize the $L^p$-metrics to geometry on Orlicz spaces.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for automorphisms of symmetric bilinear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish homological stability for automorphisms of symmetric bilinear forms over a class of principal ideal domains that includes all fields, the integers, the Gaussian integers, and the Eisenstein integers. In conjunction with Grothendieck-Witt theoretic calculations, this determines a large part of the stable cohomology of the odd orthogonal groups $O_{\langle g,g \rangle}(\mathbb Z)$ in low degrees.</description>

      <title>A Parametrization of Integral Homology 3-Spheres by the Fourth Johnson subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By results of Morita, Pitsch and, more recently, Faes, it is known that any integral homology 3-sphere can be constructed as a Heegaard splitting with a gluing map an element of the fourth Johnson subgroup. In this work we prove that the equivalence relation on the fourth Johnson subgroup induced by this construction admits an intrinsic description in terms of the fourth Johnson handlebody subgroups. In addition, we give an ``antisymmetic'' Lagrangian trace map inspired in the Lagrangian trace map introduced by Faes and compute the image of the third Johnson handlebody subgroups by the third Johnson homomorphism.</description>

      <title>Complete Topological Quantization of Higher Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After global completion of higher gauge fields (as appearing in higher-dimensional supergravity) by proper flux quantization in extraordinary nonabelian cohomology, the (non-perturbative, renormalized) topological quantum observables and quantum states of solitonic field histories are completely determined through a topological form of light-front quantization. We survey the logic of this construction and expand on aspects of the quantization argument.
  In the instructive example of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 5D SuGra) dimensionally reduced to 3D, a suitable choice of flux quantization in Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis h") recovers this way the fine detail of the traditionally renormalized (Wilson loop) quantum observables of abelian Chern-Simons theory and makes novel predictions about anyons in fractional quantum (anomalous) Hall systems.
  An analogous choice ("Hypothesis H") of global completion of 11D higher Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the higher gauge sector of 11D SuGra) realizes various aspects of the topological sector of the conjectural "M-theory" and its M5-branes.</description>

      <title>Localizing invariants of constructible sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an open-closed decomposition of the stratifying poset, we construct a new semi-orthogonal decomposition of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves on a stratified space admitting an exit-path $\infty$-category. From this we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the localizing invariants of the $\infty$-category of constructible sheaves. Since the $\ast$-pullback to the open stratum in the usual (recollement) semi-orthogonal decomposition is not strongly left adjoint, this splitting does not follow from pure sheaf theory considerations. Instead, the splitting crucially relies on the exodromy equivalence: it implies that on the level of constructible sheaves, the $\ast$-pullback to a closed stratum and the $!$-pushforward from an open stratum admit left adjoints. These new functors provide an additional semi-orthogonal decomposition (with the roles of open and closed reversed) in which the relevant functors are strongly left adjoint.</description>

      <title>Operadic Calculus for Higher Colour-Kinematics Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for algebraic foundations of colour-kinematics duality and the double-copy construction has brought into focus a generalization of Batalin--Vilkovisky algebras, referred to here as coexact BV-algebras and as $\textrm{BV}^\square$-algebras in other sources. While these structures capture the cubic sector, they fail to encode higher-valence phenomena, for which a homotopy-theoretic extension becomes necessary. This work introduces a conceptual notion of homotopy coexact BV-algebra, defined through the homotopical interplay of commutative and BV structures, and provides a concrete model in terms of generators and relations, obtained through an extension the theory of Koszul duality for operads. The resulting framework enables the systematic use of homotopical tools -- $\infty$-morphisms, homotopy transfer, rectification, and deformation theory -- and naturally accommodates the quartic-level structures recently identified in Yang--Mills theory.</description>

      <title>The equifibered approach to $\infty$-properads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a notion of $\infty$-properads that generalises $\infty$-operads by allowing operations with multiple outputs. Specializing to the case where each operation has a single output provides a simple new perspective on $\infty$-operads, but at the same time the extra generality allows for examples such as bordism categories. We also give an interpretation of our $\infty$-properads as Segal presheaves on a category of graphs by comparing them to the Segal $\infty$-properads of Hackney-Robertson-Yau. Combining these two approaches yields a flexible tool for doing higher algebra with operations that have multiple inputs and outputs. Crucially, this allows for a definition of algebras over an $\infty$-properad such that, for example, topological field theories are algebras over the bordism $\infty$-properad. The key ingredient to this paper is the notion of an equifibered map between $E_\infty$-monoids, which is a well-behaved generalisation of free maps. We also use this to prove facts about free $E_\infty$-monoids, for example that free $E_\infty$-monoids are closed under pullbacks along arbitrary maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of probabilistic variants of the one-category and diagonal topological complexity, which bound the classical LS-category and topological complexity from below. Unlike any other classical or probabilistic invariants, these invariants are rigid on spaces with finite fundamental group. On Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, we identify these new invariants with distributional category and complexity, respectively, and use them to illuminate aspects of the behavior of the latter invariants on aspherical spaces and products of spaces. We also study their properties on covering maps, $\pi_1$-isomorphisms, $H$-spaces, and closed essential manifolds, and consequently, obtain the first examples of closed manifolds beyond the real projective spaces on which the distributional theory disagrees with the classical one.</description>

      <title>The rank 8 case of a conjecture on square-zero upper triangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the polynomial algebra in $r$ variables with coefficients in an algebraically closed field $k$. When the characteristic of $k$ is $2$, Carlsson conjectured that any $\mathrm{dg}$-$A$-module that is free of rank $N$ as an $A$-module and whose homology is nontrivial and finite dimensional as a $k$-vector space satisfies $N\geq 2^r$. In this paper, we examine a stronger conjecture concerning varieties of square-zero upper triangular $N\times N$ matrices. Stratifying these varieties via Borel orbits, we show that the stronger conjecture holds when $N = 8$ without any restriction on the characteristic of $k$. This result also verifies that if $X$ is a product of $3$ spheres of any dimensions, then the elementary abelian $2$-group of rank $4$ cannot act freely on $X$.</description>

      <title>Simplicial presheaves of Green complexes and twisting cochains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct three simplicial presheaves on the site of ringed spaces, and in particular on that of complex manifolds. The descent objects for these simplicial presheaves yield Toledo--Tong's twisting cochains, simplicial twisting cochains, and complexes that appear in Green's thesis on Chern classes for coherent analytic sheaves, respectively. We thus extend the aforementioned constructions to the equivariant setting, and more generally to stacks. This is the first step in achieving push-forwards in K-theory and Riemann--Roch theorems for appropriate stacks, as was achieved by Toledo and Tong for arbitrary complex manifolds, and further pursued by O'Brian and Green.</description>

      <title>The de Rham cohomology of a Lie group modulo a dense subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a dense subgroup of a Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$. We show that the (diffeological) de Rham cohomology of $G/H$ equals the Lie algebra cohomology of $\mathfrak g/\mathfrak h$, where $\mathfrak h$ is the ideal $\{Z\in\mathfrak g:\exp(tZ)\in H \text{ for all } t\in\mathbf R\}$.</description>

      <title>Stiefel-Whitney Classes for Finite Symplectic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd prime power, and $G=\text{Sp}(2n,q)$ the finite symplectic group. We give an expression for the total Stiefel-Whitney Classes (SWCs) for orthogonal representations $\pi$ of $G$, in terms of character values of $\pi$ at elements of order $2$. We give "universal formulas'' for the fourth and eighth SWCs. For $n=2$, we compute the subring of the mod $2$ cohomology generated by the SWCs $w_k(\pi)$.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Computation of Euler Characteristic Functions and Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted Euler characteristic transform (WECT) and Euler characteristic function (ECF) have proven to be useful tools in a variety of applications. However, current methods for computing these functions are either not optimized for speed or do not scale to higher-dimensional settings. In this work, we present a vectorized framework for computing such topological descriptors using tensor operations, which is highly optimized for GPU architectures and works in full generality across simplicial and cubical complexes of arbitrary dimension. Experimentally, the framework demonstrates significant speedups over existing methods when computing the WECT and ECF across a variety of two- and three-dimensional datasets. Computation of these transforms is implemented in a publicly available Python package called pyECT.</description>
