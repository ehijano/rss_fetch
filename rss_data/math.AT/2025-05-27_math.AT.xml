      <title>Homotopy Type of Intersections of Real Bruhat Cells in Dimension 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the arbitrary intersection of real Bruhat cells. Such objects have attracted interest from various authors, particularly due to their appearance in different contexts: such as in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory and in the study of locally convex curves. We study the homotopy type of the intersection of two real Bruhat cells. This homotopy type is the same as that of an explicit submanifold of the group of real lower triangular matrices with diagonal entries equal to 1. For $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ matrices with $n\leq4$, these submanifolds are the disjoint union of contractible connected components. Our focus is on such intersections for $6\times6$ real matrices. For this, we study the connected components of Bruhat cells for permutations $\sigma\in\Sn_6$ with at most 12 inversions. We make use of the structure of the dual CW complexes associated with these components. We show that for permutations with at most 12 inversions, with the exception of $\sigma=[563412]$ , all connected components are contractible. Furthermore, for $\sigma=[563412]$, we identify new non-contractible connected components with the homotopy type of the circle.</description>

      <title>Topological Complexity of symplectic CW-complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cohomology class u of a topological space X is atoroidal if its pullback to the torus vanishes for every map from a torus to X. Furthermore, X is atoroidally symplectic if there is an atoroidal cohomology class $u\in H^2(X;F)$ such that $u^n$ is non-zero. We prove that every atoroidally symplectic CW-complex X of dimension 2n has topological complexity 4n.
  This generalizes a result of Grant and Mescher who prove the corresponding statement in the case where X is an atoroidally c-symplectic manifold and u is a de Rham cohomology class. Using this generalisation, we obtain new calculations of topological complexity, including for many products of 3-manifolds and of group presentation complexes.</description>

      <title>Universality of span 2-categories and the construction of 6-functor formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an $\infty$-category $C$ equipped with suitable wide subcategories $I, P \subset E\subset C$, we show that the $(\infty,2)$-category $\text{S}{\scriptstyle\text{PAN}}_2(C,E)_{P,I}$ of higher (or iterated) spans defined by Haugseng has the universal property that 2-functors $\text{S}{\scriptstyle\text{PAN}}_2(C,E)_{P,I} \to \mathbb D$ correspond precisely to $(I, P)$-biadjointable functors $C^\text{op} \to \mathbb D$, i.e. functors $F$ where $F(i)$ for $i \in I$ admits a left adjoint and $F(p)$ for $p \in P$ admits a right adjoint satisfying various Beck-Chevalley conditions. We also extend this universality to the symmetric monoidal and lax symmetric monoidal settings. This provides a conceptual explanation for - and an independent proof of - the Mann-Liu-Zheng construction of 6-functor formalisms from suitable functors $C^\text{op}\to\text{CAlg}(\text{Cat})$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy stability of spaces of non-resultant systems of bounded multiplicity with real coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our study of the topology of the spaces of $m$ tuples of real polynomials with common degree $d$ and without common roots of multiplicity $n$, and in particular their stability properties with respect to $d$. In an earlier paper we have proved a homotopy stability result and determined the stable homotopy types of such spaces in the case $m n &gt;=4$. In the case $m n= 3$ we could only prove stability in homology. In this paper we prove the corresponding homotopy result for the case $m n =3$.</description>

      <title>Topological Stability and Latschev-type Reconstruction Theorems for Spaces of Curvature Bounded Above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of homotopy-type reconstruction of compact subsets $X\subset\R^N$ that have the Alexandrov curvature bounded above ($\leq$ $\kappa$) in the intrinsic length metric. The reconstructed spaces are in the form of Vietoris--Rips complexes computed from a compact sample $S$, Hausdorff--close to the unknown shape $X$. Instead of the Euclidean metric on the sample, our reconstruction technique leverages a path-based metric to compute these complexes. As naturally emerging in the framework of reconstruction, we also study the Gromov--Hausdorff topological stability and finiteness problem for general compact for subspaces of curvature bounded above. Our techniques provide novel sampling conditions as an alternative to the existing and commonly used techniques using weak feature size and $\mu$--reach. In particular, we leverage the concept of the {\em large scale distortion}, and show examples of Euclidean subspaces, for which the known parameters such as the reach, $\mu$--reach and weak features size vanish, whereas the large scale distortion is finite, making our reconstruction results applicable for such cases.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type $A$ and type $B$ permutohedral varieties are classic examples of mathematics, and their topological invariants are well known. This naturally leads to the investigation of the topology of their real loci, known as type $A$ and type $B$ real permutohedral varieties.
  The rational cohomology rings of type $A$ real permutohedral varieties are fully described in terms of alternating permutations. Until now, only rational Betti numbers of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties have been described in terms of $B$-snakes. In this paper, we explicitly describe the multiplicative structure of the cohomology rings of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties in terms of $B$-snakes.</description>

      <title>Cancellation properties for exotic $4$-dimensional positive scalar curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruberman constructed families $\{g_n\vert n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathcal{R}^+ (M)$ of metrics of positive scalar curvature on certain $4$-manifolds which are concordant but lie in different path components of $\mathcal{R}^+ (M)$. We prove a cancellation result along the following lines. For each closed manifold $N$, there is a map $\nu_N: \mathcal{R}^+ (M) \to \mathcal{R}^+ (M \times N)$, well-defined up to homotopy, that takes the product with $N$. We prove that when $N$ has positive dimension $\nu_N$ takes all metrics of Ruberman's family to the same path component. This is trivial when $N$ has a psc metric and follows from pseudoisotopy theory when $\dim (N) \geq 3$. Our proof is cobordism theoretic in nature and also applies to $\dim(N) =1,2$. The proof relies on rigidity properties for the action of the diffeomorphism group on $\mathcal{R}^+(L)$ for high-dimensional $N$ and a calculation of $\pi_1(\mathrm{MTSO(4)})$ that we also carry out.
  Recently, Auckly and Ruberman exhibited examples of elements in higher homotopy groups of $\mathcal{R}^+(M^4)$ for certain $M$. Using the same method, we also prove that these elements lie in the kernel of the induced map $(\nu_N)_*$ on rational homotopy.</description>

      <title>Deformations and Lifts of Calabi-Yau Varieties in Characteristic $p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $p$ using techniques from derived algebraic geometry. We prove a mixed characteristic analogue of the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem (which states that Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $0$ are unobstructed), and we show that ordinary Calabi-Yau varieties admit canonical lifts to characteristic $0$, generalising the Serre-Tate theorem on ordinary abelian varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a fast algorithm for computing discrete cubical homology of graphs over finite fields with an appropriate characteristic. This algorithm improves on several computational steps compared to constructions in the existing literature, with the key insights including: a faster way to generate all singular cubes, reducing the dimensions of vector spaces in the chain complex by taking a quotient over automorphisms of the cube, and preprocessing graphs using the axiomatic treatment of discrete cubical homology.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomology and scl of verbal wreath products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the bounded cohomology and the stable commutator length of verbal wreath products \(\Gamma \wr^{_W}A\), where \(A\) has trivial bounded cohomology for a sufficiently large class of coefficients. We prove that the stable commutator length always vanishes, and that the bounded cohomology vanishes in positive degrees for some such verbal wreath products; including the standard restricted wreath products (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups), as well as verbal wreath products arising from n-solvable, \(n\)-nilpotent, and \(k\)-Burnside \((k = 2, 3, 4, 6)\) verbal products. As an application, we show that every group of type \(F_p\) isometrically embeds into a group of type \(F_p\) with vanishing bounded cohomology in positive degrees for a large class of coefficients.</description>

      <title>Quasi Zigzag Persistence: A Topological Framework for Analyzing Time-Varying Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Quasi Zigzag Persistent Homology (QZPH) as a framework for analyzing time-varying data by integrating multiparameter persistence and zigzag persistence. To this end, we introduce a stable topological invariant that captures both static and dynamic features at different scales. We present an algorithm to compute this invariant efficiently. We show that it enhances the machine learning models when applied to tasks such as sleep-stage detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the evolving patterns in time-varying datasets.</description>
