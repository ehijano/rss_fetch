      <title>A chaotic lattice field theory in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe spatiotemporally chaotic (or turbulent) field theories discretized over d-dimensional lattices in terms of sums over their multi-periodic orbits. `Chaos theory' is here recast in the language of statistical mechanics, field theory, and solid state physics, with the traditional periodic orbits theory of low-dimensional, temporally chaotic dynamics a special, one-dimensional case.
  In the field-theoretical formulation, there is no time evolution. Instead, treating the temporal and spatial directions on equal footing, one determines the spatiotemporally periodic orbits that contribute to the partition sum of the theory, each a solution of the system's defining deterministic equations, with sums over time-periodic orbits of dynamical systems theory replaced here by sums of d-periodic orbits over d-dimensional spacetime geometries, the weight of each orbit given by the Jacobian of its spatiotemporal orbit Jacobian operator. The weights, evaluated by application of the Bloch theorem to the spectrum of periodic orbit's Jacobian operator, are multiplicative for spacetime orbit repeats, leading to a spatiotemporal zeta function formulation of the theory in terms of prime orbits.</description>

      <title>Locality Blended Next Generation Reservoir Computing For Attention Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend an advanced variation of a machine learning algorithm, next-generation reservoir Computing (NGRC), to forecast the dynamics of the Ikeda map of a chaotic laser. The machine learning model is created by observing time-series data generated by the Ikeda map, and the trained model is used to forecast the behavior without any input from the map. The Ikeda map is a particularly challenging problem to learn because of the complicated map functions. We overcome the challenge by a novel improvement of the NGRC concept by emphasizing simpler polynomial models localized to well-designed regions of phase space and then blending these models between regions, a method that we call locality blended next-generation reservoir computing (LB-NGRC). This approach allows for better performance with relatively smaller data sets, and gives a new level of interpretability. We achieve forecasting horizons exceeding five Lyapunov times, and we demonstrate that the `climate' of the model is learned over long times.</description>

      <title>Stability enhanced by transient attractors in a memristive chaotic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of a memristor in a chaotic system can significantly modify its dynamical behavior. In this paper, we couple a discrete memristor model with a chaotic map to investigate the memristor's impact on the stability of chaotic attractors. Our results reveal that introducing the memristor substantially enlarges the basin of attraction of a given chaotic attractor, thereby enhancing its stability. This phenomenon arises as a direct consequence of the memory and switching effects introduced by the memristor, which create new paths to the chaotic attractors.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation Models for Computing Probability Distributions of Complex Multiscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data assimilation strategy aimed at accurately capturing key non-Gaussian structures in probability distributions using a small ensemble size. A major challenge in statistical forecasting of nonlinearly coupled multiscale systems is mitigating the large errors that arise when computing high-order statistical moments. To address this issue, a high-order stochastic-statistical modeling framework is proposed that integrates statistical data assimilation into finite ensemble predictions. The method effectively reduces the approximation errors in finite ensemble estimates of non-Gaussian distributions by employing a filtering update step that incorporates observation data in leading moments to refine the high-order statistical feedback. Explicit filter operators are derived from intrinsic nonlinear coupling structures, allowing straightforward numerical implementations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through extensive numerical experiments on a prototype triad system. The triad system offers an instructive and computationally manageable platform mimicking essential aspects of nonlinear turbulent dynamics. The numerical results show that the statistical data assimilation algorithm consistently captures the mean and covariance, as well as various non-Gaussian probability distributions exhibited in different statistical regimes of the triad system. The modeling framework can serve as a useful tool for efficient sampling and reliable forecasting of complex probability distributions commonly encountered in a wide variety of applications involving multiscale coupling and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Many body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry and local TRS - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

      <title>Data-Driven Forecasting of High-Dimensional Transient and Stationary Processes via Space-Time Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required. The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation information.</description>

      <title>Controlling Transient Chaos in the Lorenz System with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sustain transient chaos in the Lorenz system through the estimation of safety functions using a transformer-based model. Unlike classical methods that rely on iterative computations, the proposed model directly predicts safety functions without requiring fine-tuning or extensive system knowledge. The results demonstrate that this approach effectively maintains chaotic trajectories within the desired phase space region, even in the presence of noise, making it a viable alternative to traditional methods. A detailed comparison of safety functions, safe sets, and their control performance highlights the strengths and trade-offs of the two approaches.</description>
