      <title>Gabor-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Fast Simulations of Acoustic Wavefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained increasing attention for solving partial differential equations, including the Helmholtz equation, due to their flexibility and mesh-free formulation. However, their low-frequency bias limits their accuracy and convergence speed for high-frequency wavefield simulations. To alleviate these problems, we propose a simplified PINN framework that incorporates Gabor functions, designed to capture the oscillatory and localized nature of wavefields more effectively. Unlike previous attempts that rely on auxiliary networks to learn Gabor parameters, we redefine the network's task to map input coordinates to a custom Gabor coordinate system, simplifying the training process without increasing the number of trainable parameters compared to a simple PINN. We validate the proposed method across multiple velocity models, including the complex Marmousi and Overthrust models, and demonstrate its superior accuracy, faster convergence, and better robustness features compared to both traditional PINNs and earlier Gabor-based PINNs. Additionally, we propose an efficient integration of a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) to enhance wavefield behavior near the boundaries. These results suggest that our approach offers an efficient and accurate alternative for scattered wavefield modeling and lays the groundwork for future improvements in PINN-based seismic applications.</description>

      <title>West Antarctic Meltwater can Prevent an AMOC Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and polar ice sheets are coupled tipping elements, allowing for potential cascading tipping events in which tipping is facilitated by their mutual interactions. However, while an AMOC destabilization driven by Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) meltwater release is well documented, the consequences of a West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) tipping on the AMOC remain unclear. In the Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity CLIMBER-X, we perform experiments where meltwater fluxes representing plausible tipping trajectories of the GIS and WAIS are applied. We find that WAIS meltwater input can increase the AMOC resilience to GIS meltwater. In particular, we show that this stabilizing effect can cause the AMOC recovery and, for the first time in a comprehensive model, totally prevent an AMOC collapse. Moreover, we find this stabilzation to occur for ice sheet tipping trajectories that are relevant under high future greenhouse gas emission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Geological Prediction for Tunnel Excavation Using Full Waveform Inversion Integrating Sobolev Space Regularization with a Quadratic Penalty Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the process of tunnel excavation, advanced geological prediction technology has become indispensable for safe, economical, and efficient tunnel construction. Although traditional methods such as drilling and geological analysis are effective, they typically involve destructive processes, carry high risks, and incur significant costs. In contrast, non-destructive geophysical exploration offers a more convenient and economical alternative. However, the accuracy and precision of these non-destructive methods can be severely compromised by complex geological structures, restrictions on observation coverage and environmental noise. To address these challenges effectively, a novel approach using frequency domain full waveform inversion, based on a penalty method and Sobolev space regularization, has been proposed to enhance the performance of non-destructive predictions. The proposed method constructs a soft-constrained optimization problem by restructuring the misfit function into a combination of data misfit and wave equation drive terms to enhance convexity. Additionally, it semi-extends the search space to both the wavefield and the model parameters to mitigate the strong nonlinearity of the optimization, facilitating high-resolution inversion. Furthermore, a Sobolev space regularization algorithm is introduced to flexibly adjust the regularization path, addressing issues related to noise and artefacts to enhance the robustness of the algorithm. We evaluated the performance of the proposed full waveform inversion using several tunnel models with fault structures by comparing the results of the enhanced method with those of traditional least-squares-based Tikhonov regularization and total variation regularization full waveform inversion methods. The verification results confirm the superior capabilities of the proposed method as expected.</description>

      <title>Recursive Interferometric Surface-wave Suppression For Improved Reflection Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution seismic reflections are essential for imaging and monitoring applications. In seismic land surveys using sources and receivers at the surface, surface waves often dominate, masking the reflections. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of a two-step procedure to suppress surface waves in an active-source reflection seismic dataset. First, we apply seismic interferometry (SI) by cross-correlation, turning receivers into virtual sources to estimate the dominant surface waves. Then, we perform adaptive subtraction to minimise the difference between the surface waves in the original data and the result of SI. We propose a new approach where the initial suppression results are used for further iterations, followed by adaptive subtraction. This technique aims to enhance the efficacy of data-driven surface-wave suppression through an iterative process. We use a 2D seismic reflection dataset from Scheemda, situated in the Groningen province of the Netherlands, to illustrate the technique's efficiency. A comparison between the data after recursive interferometric surface-wave suppression and the original data across time and frequency-wavenumber domains shows significant suppression of the surface waves, enhancing visualization of the reflections for following subsurface imaging and monitoring studies.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Magnetic Data using Learned Dictionaries and Scale Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic data inversion is an important tool in geophysics, used to infer subsurface magnetic susceptibility distributions from surface magnetic field measurements. This inverse problem is inherently ill-posed, characterized by non-unique solutions, depth ambiguity, and sensitivity to noise. Traditional inversion approaches rely on predefined regularization techniques to stabilize solutions, limiting their adaptability to complex or diverse geological scenarios. In this study, we propose an approach that integrates variable dictionary learning and scale-space methods to address these challenges. Our method employs learned dictionaries, allowing for adaptive representation of complex subsurface features that are difficult to capture with predefined bases. Additionally, we extend classical variational inversion by incorporating multi-scale representations through a scale-space framework, enabling the progressive introduction of structural detail while mitigating overfitting. We implement both fixed and dynamic dictionary learning techniques, with the latter introducing iteration-dependent dictionaries for enhanced flexibility. Using a synthetic dataset to simulate geological scenarios, we demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to conventional variational and dictionary-based methods. Our results highlight the potential of learned dictionaries, especially when coupled with scale-space dynamics, to improve model recovery and noise handling. These findings underscore the promise of our data-driven approach for advance magnetic data inversion and its applications in geophysical exploration, environmental assessment, and mineral prospecting.
