      <title>Projection-based model order reduction for residence time distribution analysis of an industrial-scale continuous casting tundish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow behavior in the continuous casting tundish plays a critical role in steel quality and is typically characterized via residence time distribution (RTD) curves. This study investigates the fluid flow behaviour in a single-strand tundish using numerical and experimental approaches. Full-order model (FOM) steady-state simulations were conducted under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions to assess the influence of thermal buoyancy on the flow characteristics. The results show that buoyancy effects under non-isothermal conditions have a negligible impact on the overall velocity field. The converged flow fields serve as initial conditions for transient tracer transport simulations, enabling evaluation of RTD curves and volume partitioning. A Galerkin projection-based reduced-order model (ROM) is developed to efficiently derive RTD curves. Comparison of RTD curves from experiments, FOM simulations, and ROM predictions demonstrates strong agreement, with both computational approaches closely matching experimental data. A parameter-time dependent ROM is subsequently developed using Galerkin projection and operator interpolation. This enables efficient evaluation of RTD curves across varying parameter values with significantly reduced computational cost compared to full-order simulations. The ROM framework is well-suited for real-time analysis, design processes, optimization, and digital twin applications in metallurgical processes.</description>

      <title>Implicit Augmentation from Distributional Symmetry in Turbulence Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The immense computational cost of simulating turbulence has motivated the use of machine learning approaches for super-resolving turbulent flows. A central challenge is ensuring that learned models respect physical symmetries, such as rotational equivariance. We show that standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can partially acquire this symmetry without explicit augmentation or specialized architectures, as turbulence itself provides implicit rotational augmentation in both time and space. Using 3D channel-flow subdomains with differing anisotropy, we find that models trained on more isotropic mid-plane data achieve lower equivariance error than those trained on boundary layer data, and that greater temporal or spatial sampling further reduces this error. We show a distinct scale-dependence of equivariance error that occurs regardless of dataset anisotropy that is consistent with Kolmogorov's local isotropy hypothesis. These results clarify when rotational symmetry must be explicitly incorporated into learning algorithms and when it can be obtained directly from turbulence, enabling more efficient and symmetry-aware super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Monte Carlo simulation of the Enskog equation for multiscale dense gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general synthetic iterative scheme is proposed to solve the Enskog equation within a Monte Carlo framework. The method demonstrates rapid convergence by reducing intermediate Monte Carlo evolution and preserves the asymptotic-preserving property, enabling spatial cell sizes much larger than the mean free path in near-continuum flows. This is realized through mesoscopic-macroscopic two-way coupling: the mesoscopic Monte Carlo simulation provides high-order constitutive relations to close the moment (synthetic) equation, while the macroscopic synthetic equation, once solved toward steady state, directs the evolution of simulation particles in the Monte Carlo method. The accuracy of the proposed general synthetic iterative scheme is verified through one-dimensional normal shock wave and planar Fourier heat transfer problems, while its fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties are demonstrated in the force-driven Poiseuille flow and two-dimensional hypersonic cylinder flow and low-speed porous media flow, where the simulation time is reduced by several orders of magnitude in near-continuum flows. With the proposed method, a brief analysis is conducted on the role of the adsorption layer in porous media flow, mimicking shale gas extraction.</description>

      <title>A Fourier/Modal-Spectral-Element Method for the Simulation of High-Reynolds Number Incompressible Stratified Flows in Domains with a Single Non-Periodic Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the components of a high-order accurate Navier-Stokes solver designed to simulate high-Reynolds-number stratified flows. The proposed numerical model addresses some of the numerical and computational challenges that high-Reynolds-number simulations pose, facilitating the reproduction of stratified turbulent fluid dynamics typically observed in oceanic and atmospheric flows, namely the development of thin regions of high vertical shear, strongly layered turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and internal wave radiation. This Navier-Stokes solver utilizes a Fourier pseudo-spectral method in the horizontal direction and a modal spectral element discretization in the vertical. We adopt an implicit-explicit time discretization scheme that involves solving several one-dimensional Helmholtz problems at each time step. Static condensation and modal boundary-adapted basis functions result in an inexpensive algorithm based on solving many small tridiagonal systems. A series of benchmark studies is presented to demonstrate the robustness of the flow solver. These include two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, concluding with a turbulent stratified wake generated by a sphere in linear stratification.</description>

      <title>The influence of boundary conditions and interfacial slip on the time taken to achieve a nonequilibrium steady-state for highly confined flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the equilibration time to attain steady-state for a system of liquid molecules under boundary-driven planar Couette flow via nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. In particular, we examine the equilibration time for the two common types of boundary driven flow: one in which both walls slide with equal and opposite velocity, and the other in which one wall is fixed and the other moves with twice the velocity. Both flows give identical steady-state strain rates, and hence flow properties, but the transient behaviour is completely different. We find that in the case of no-slip boundary conditions, the equilibration times for the counter-sliding walls flow are exactly 4 times faster than those of the single sliding wall system, and this is independent of the atomistic nature of the fluid, i.e., it is an entirely hydrodynamic feature. We also find that systems that exhibit slip have longer equilibration times in general and the ratio of equilibration times for the two types of boundary-driven flow is even more pronounced. We analyse the problem by decomposing a generic planar Couette flow into a linear sum of purely symmetric and antisymmetric flows. We find that the no-slip equilibration time is dominated by the slowest decaying eigenvalue of the solution to the Navier-Stokes equation. In the case of slip, the longest relaxation time is now dominated by the transient slip velocity response, which is longer than the no-slip response time. In the case of a high-slip system of water confined to graphene channels, the enhancement is over two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of wind farm wake flow based on multi-scale feature recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, efficient prediction of wind flow with wake effects is crucial for wind-farm layout and power forecasting. Existing approaches-physical measurements, numerical simulations, physics-based models, and data-driven models-face trade-offs: the first two are time- and resource-intensive; physics-based models can lack accuracy due to limited physics; data-driven methods leverage abundant, high-quality data and are increasingly popular. We propose a rapid, data-driven wake-flow model inspired by video-frame interpolation and the principle of similarity. Field data are transformed into images; multi-scale feature recognition then identifies, matches, and interpolates wake structures using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to generate intermediate flow fields. Six representative mini wind-farm cases validate the approach, spanning variations in turbine spacing, turbine size, combined spacing-size variations, different turbine counts, and wind-direction misalignment. Across cases, the method achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.68-2.28%. Because it flexibly computes both 2D and 3D wake fields, the method offers substantial computational-efficiency gains over large-eddy simulation (LES) and Meteodyn WT when 2D accuracy suffices for industrial needs. Accordingly, it provides a practical alternative to measurements, high-fidelity simulations, and simplified physics-based models, enabling efficient expansion of wake-flow databases for wind-farm design and power prediction while balancing speed and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Transonic buffet and incompressible low-frequency oscillations at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent, self-sustained oscillations of the flow over aircraft wings can lead to unsteady loads that detrimentally affect aircraft safety and stability, thus limiting the flight envelope. Two such types of oscillations are the low-frequency oscillations (LFO) observed in flow over airfoils close to stall in the incompressible regime and transonic buffet, which occurs at high speeds and involves oscillating shock waves. The possibility that these two are linked has been explored only recently at low Reynolds numbers (Re ~ O(1e4)) and natural transition conditions (Moise et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 981, 2024, p. A23). However, the shock wave structure in the transonic regime under these conditions differs substantially when compared to high Reynolds number flows, and it is unknown whether a connection can be established at high Reynolds numbers. This study investigates this possibility by performing incompressible and compressible URANS simulations at Re = 1e7. We show that transonic buffet exists for a narrow range of freestream Mach numbers across a wide range of angles of attack, and that buffet-like oscillations are observed at higher angles even in the absence of shock waves. Using a spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), we show that the dominant modes associated with these oscillations are strongly correlated for all cases, even in the absence of shock waves. Furthermore, using a fully incompressible URANS framework, we capture LFO at the same Reynolds number and confirm the connection between these two phenomena using SPOD. These results imply that neither shock waves nor compressibility is necessary to sustain such low-frequency oscillations, suggesting that the fundamental mechanism governing them is related to flow separation. This can potentially help in improved control strategies to extend the flight envelope by mitigating buffet or LFO.</description>

      <title>A geometric interpolation scheme for applying dynamic wetting to three-dimensional volume of fluid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a three-dimensional framework for simulating dynamic wetting phenomena using the volume of fluid (VOF) method, implemented in Basilisk. A geometric interpolation scheme is developed to obtain an accurate and reliable value of the contact line velocity. To capture realistic wetting dynamics, a dynamic contact angle model is integrated that considers also contact angle hysteresis (CAH). The approach is validated against various experimental results, including droplet spreading, splashing, and sliding and demonstrates quantitative agreement with the three-dimensional wetting behavior observed. Additionally, a comparative analysis between dynamic and static contact angle models is performed.</description>

      <title>von K\'arm\'an--Howarth Similarity of Spatial Correlations and the Distribution of Correlation Lengths in Solar Photospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations in the Sun's photospheric magnetic field are the primary source of the turbulence that can heat and accelerate the solar atmosphere, and thus play an important role in the production and evolution of the solar wind that permeates the heliosphere. A key parameter that characterizes this turbulence is the correlation scale of fluctuations, which determines the injection of turbulent energy into the plasma and influences the diffusive transport of solar energetic particles. This study employs magnetogram data acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory to characterize an ensemble of spatial autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of magnetic fluctuations in the photosphere. It is shown that the two-point ACFs satisfy the similarity-decay hypothesis of von K\'arm\'an and Howarth, a fundamental property of turbulent systems: following a rescaling of the ACFs by energy and correlation lengths, a quasi-universal functional form is obtained demonstrating exponential decay of correlations. The probability distribution function of transverse correlation lengths (\(\lambda\)) is shown to be approximately log-normal. A mosaic of the spatial distribution of \(\lambda\) over the photosphere is presented; the ``quiet Sun'' tends to have \(\lambda\sim 1500\) km (albeit with a wide distribution), which is close to the scale of solar granulation; systematically longer lengths are associated with active regions. A positive correlation is observed between mean magnetic field magnitude and \(\lambda\), and empirical fits are derived to quantify this relationship. These results improve our understanding of the nature of turbulence in the solar photosphere and the origin of coronal and solar-wind turbulence, while providing observational constraints for models that describe the transport of turbulence from solar and stellar photospheres into their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>A Reformulation of UVN-Flash for Multicomponent Two-Phase Systems with Application to CO2-rich Mixture Transport in Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pipeline transport of dense-phase CO2-rich mixtures is a crucial component in carbon capture and storage (CCS). Accurate modeling requires coupling of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, especially during transient events such as depressurization. In this work, we present a unified framework for two-phase multicomponent transport in pipelines that integrates both aspects. Specifically, we employ the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) for modeling the transport of two-phase CO2-rich mixture, with thermodynamic closure provided by a Helmholtz energy-based equation of state. Phase equilibrium calculations are performed using UVN-flash, supplemented with a stability analysis procedure to detect phase separation and generate initial guesses for the phase-equilibrium calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel tailored UVN-flash routine that aligns with the fluid dynamics formulation. This is achieved by introducing an alternative and better-scaled set of variables for the phase-equilibrium calculations. The proposed framework is applied to the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing CO2-rich mixtures, demonstrating its effectiveness for CCS-relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing deep learning of ammonia/natural gas combustion kinetics via physics-aware data augmentation and scale separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient numerical simulation of ammonia combustion is critical for advancing ammonia-based energy systems, where turbulent flame dynamics and pollutant formation strongly affect practical applicability. However, such simulations are hindered by the need to solve high-dimensional stiff chemical ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which constitute the primary computational bottleneck. To address this challenge, this study explores Deep learning for solving Flame chemical kinetics with stiff ODEs (DFODE) in ammonia/natural gas combustion. Thermochemical training data are obtained from one-dimensional (1D) freely propagating premixed laminar flames, and a physics-aware augmentation strategy combining interpolation of neighboring states with constrained random perturbations is introduced to overcome sampling imbalance near steep flame-front gradients. In addition, transformation strategies for model target formulation were evaluated, and the prediction accuracy in low-temperature regimes was notably enhanced through scale separation for targets spanning multiple orders of magnitude. Validation in 1D laminar flames confirms the effectiveness of these refinements, while a posteriori evaluation in a two-dimensional (2D) propagating flame under homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) demonstrates that the trained models generalize to unseen conditions. The DNN surrogates reproduce flame characteristics with high fidelity and deliver up to a 20x speedup in end-to-end CFD simulations. These results highlight the potential of deep learning-based chemical kinetics to accelerate ammonia/natural gas combustion modeling, supporting efficient and scalable high-fidelity simulations for emerging zero-carbon energy systems.</description>

      <title>Lost in Latent Space: An Empirical Study of Latent Diffusion Models for Physics Emulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.</description>

      <title>Long-wave instability of periodic shear flows for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Kolmogorov proposed to study the instability of the shear flow $(\sin(y),0)$ in the vanishing viscosity regime in tori $\mathbb{T}_{\alpha}\times \mathbb{T}$. This question was later resolved by Meshalkin and Sinai. We extend the problem to general shear flows $(U(y),0)$ and show that every $U(y)$ exhibits long-wave instability whenever $\|\partial_y^{-1} U\|_{L^2} &gt; \nu$ and $\alpha\ll \nu$, with $\nu$ being the kinematic viscosity. This instability mechanism confirms previous findings by Yudovich in 1966, supported also by several numerical results, and is established through two independent approaches: one via the construction of Kato's isomorphism and one via normal forms. Unlike in many other applications of the latter methods, both proofs deal with the presence of a delicate term in the linearized operator that becomes singular as $\alpha$ approaches $0$.</description>
