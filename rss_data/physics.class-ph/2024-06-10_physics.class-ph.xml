      <title>Holding the fields constant: A shape-calculus approach to electromagnetic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the mathematical theory of shape calculus as tool, we perform a rigorous investigation of the virtual work principle for the computation of electromagnetic forces in static settings. The main goal is to shed light on the widely held belief that the virtual work principle entails passively advecting the fields with the virtual displacement when computing deformation-dependent field energies gradients.
  The adjoint approach to differentiation of functionals under variational constraints provides a mathematical justification for this belief. However, it also shows that passively advecting the actual electromagnetic fields is sufficient only in the case of linear materials. In the general case, also fields arising as solutions of adjoint variational problems have to be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Classical Models of the Electron Spin -- Comparison of the Electric Current Model and the Magnetic Charge Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic matter finds its microscopic origin in the intrinsic electron spin, which is considered to be a purely quantum mechanical property of the electron. To incorporate the influence of the electron spin in the microscopic and macroscopic Maxwell equations -- and thereby in classical physics -- two models have been utilized: the electric current and the magnetic charge model. This paper aims to highlight fundamental problems of the commonly used current loop model, widely employed in textbooks. This work demonstrates that the behavior of a constant electric current dipole is not described by the laws of classical electrodynamics. More precisely, the electric current model is dependent on external forces, not included in Maxwells field and force equations, in order to maintain the force balance on the electric charge density inside the electron. These external forces change dynamically and do work on the system as the electron interacts with external fields. Consequently, the energies derived from classical physics (gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy, electrodynamic field energy) are not conserved in a system including constant electric current dipoles. In contrast to the electric current model, the magnetic charge model employs separate magnetic charges to model the electron spin, requiring the Maxwell equations to be extended by magnetic sources. This paper intends to illustrate that the magnetic charge model has significant advantages over the electric current model as it needs no external forces and energies, is a closed electromechanical system and is fully modeled by the classical laws of physics. This work forms the basis for the derivation and consideration of equivalent problems in macroscopic systems involving ferromagnetic matter.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous optical singularities and duality-protected dark directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves are described by not only polarization ellipses but also cyclically rotating vectors tracing out them. The corresponding fields are respectively directionless steady line fields and directional instantaneous vector fields. Here we study the seminal topic of electromagnetic scattering from the perspective of instantaneous vector fields and uncover how the global topology of the momentum sphere regulates local distributions of tangent scattered fields. Structurally-stable generic singularities of vector fields move cyclically along lines of linear polarizations and at any instant their index sum has to be the Euler characteristic $\chi=2$. This contrasts sharply with steady line fields, of which generic singularities constrained by the Euler characteristic locate on points of circular polarizations. From such unique perspective of instantaneous singularities, we discovered that for circularly-polarized waves scattered by electromagnetic duality-symmetric particles, since linearly-polarized scatterings are prohibited by helicity conservation, there must exist at least one dark direction along which the scattering is strictly zero. Two such dark directions can be tuned to overlap, along which the scattering would remain zero for arbitrary incident polarizations. We have essentially revealed that \textit{polarizations underdescribe vectorial electromagnetic waves and the instantaneous perspective is indispensable}. The complementarity we discover provides broader and deeper insights into not only electromagnetism, but also other branches of wave physics where singularities are generic and ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>From microscopic to macroscopic: the large number dynamics of agents and cells, possibly interacting with a chemical background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we review some recent results dealing with the transition between microscopic and macroscopic scales in different fields, including kinetic theory, cells movement in biology, chemotaxis, flocking phenomena and agent systems. The methodology of the mean-field approach of this study uses  the concept of marginals instead of the empirical measure paradigm. Numerical computations showing some theoretically unexpected features are presented  at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Propagation in rough waveguides: Forward and inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss here the direct and inverse problems for wave propagation in a waveguide with rough internal surface and arbitrary mean shape. The high degree of multiple scattering inside the waveguide poses significant challenges both for the forward computation and for the recovery of the surface profile, and raises important questions about scattering cross-sections. This paper falls into two parts corresponding to these issues.
  We first apply Left-Right (L-R) operator splitting to calculate the scattered fields in 2- and 3-dimensional waveguides. Using this we illustrate the scattered fields and the effect of surface roughness. In the second part we formulate an algorithm for surface recovery from field measurements along the waveguide axis, which generalises recent work on surfaces in 2 dimensions. This method utilizes forward scattering assumptions in effect by formulating an integral equation in the unknown surface field, treated as a function of the surface. Although discussed in the context of waveguides, the formulae are given in a form applicable to a variety of geometries, with coefficients which will depend on and be determined by each specific application.</description>

      <title>A Note on Norton's Dome</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.01719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Norton's Dome" is an example of a Newtonian system that violates the Lipschitz condition at a single point, leading to non-unique solutions (indeterminism). Here we reformulate this problem into a "weak" form (in the sense of distributions). In our description the indeterminism manifests through the problematic interpretation of initial conditions, since distributions (as linear functionals on the space of test functions) do not have values at individual points.</description>

      <title>Classical Dynamical Symmetries and Geometry of Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that all spherical symmetric potentials are capable of producing dynamical symmetries in classical one-body motions, thanks to the inevitable existence of symmetry axes associated with turning points for corresponding trajectories. This will definitely expand the class of maximally superintegrable one-body motions in central potentials that until now was considered to include only the Newtonian and Hookean cases. A simple method is proposed to identify and characterize these dynamical symmetries.</description>

      <title>A mechanical analogue of electromagnetic induction for waves in a chiral elastic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Faraday's law on electromagnetic induction states that a change of magnetic field through a coil wire induces a current in the wire. A mechanical analogue of the Lorentz force, induced by a magnetic field on an electric charge, is the gyroscopic force. Here, we demonstrate a mechanical analogy with a chiral elastic waveguide subjected to gyroscopic forcing. We study waves in an infinite mass-spring `gyrocore helix', which consists of a helix and a central line (gyroscopic elastic core). The helicoidal geometric chirality is considered in conjunction with a physical chirality, induced by gyroscopic forces. It is shown that the interplay between these two chiral inputs leads to the breaking of symmetry of the associated dispersion diagram, resulting in a unidirectional waveform with the direction of propagation being tunable through the gyricity.</description>

      <title>Exact Maxwell evolution equation of resonators dynamics: temporal coupled-mode theory revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its widespread significance, the temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) lacks a foundational validation based on electromagnetic principles and stands as a phenomenological theory relying on fitted coupling coefficients. We employ an ab initio Maxwellian approach using quasinormal-mode theory to derive an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation for resonator dynamics. While the resulting differential equation bears resemblance to the classical one, it introduces novel terms embodying distinct physics, suggesting that the CMT predictions could be faulted by dedicated experiments, for instance carried out with short and off-resonance pulses, or with resonators of sizes comparable to or greater than the wavelength. Nonetheless, our examination indicates that, despite its inherent lack of strictness, the CMT enables precise predictions for numerous experiments due to the flexibility provided by the fitted coupling coefficients. The new EME equation is anticipated to be applicable to all electromagnetic resonator geometries, and the theoretical approach we have taken can be extended to other wave physics.</description>
