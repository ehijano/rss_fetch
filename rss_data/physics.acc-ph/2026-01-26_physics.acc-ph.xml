      <title>RF Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiofrequency (RF) systems play a critical role in particle accelerators by enabling the acceleration, manipulation, and diagnosis of charged particle beams. At the heart of many of these systems lies the RF cavity, whose effective design requires close collaboration among RF designers, beam physicists, and mechanical engineers. This chapter presents the fundamental principles of RF systems, with particular emphasis on RF cavities, and underscores the interdisciplinary effort involved in their development. The SwissFEL X-ray free-electron laser at the Paul Scherrer Institut serves as a key example to illustrate these concepts.</description>

      <title>Corrections for systematic errors in slit-profiler transverse phase space measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In photo injectors, the transverse emittance is one of the key measures of beam quality as it defines the possible performance of the whole facility. As such it is important to measure the emittance in photo injectors and ensure the accuracy of these measurements. While there are many different methods of measuring the emittance, this paper focuses on quantifying the systematic errors present in transverse phase space measurements taken with slit-profiler methods, i.e. scanning a narrow slit over the beam and continually measuring the passed beamlets' divergence with a downstream profiler. The measurement errors include effects of the slit size, beamlet imaging, and residual space charge. While these effects are generally small, they can have significant impact on the measured emittance when the 2D phase space is strongly coupled. The systematic effects studied and corrections are demonstrated with simulations and measurements from the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) using a slit-screen emittance scanner.</description>
