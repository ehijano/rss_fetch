      <title>Hamiltonian Mechanics of Feature Learning: Bottleneck Structure in Leaky ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Leaky ResNets, which interpolate between ResNets ($\tilde{L}=0$) and Fully-Connected nets ($\tilde{L}\to\infty$) depending on an 'effective depth' hyper-parameter $\tilde{L}$. In the infinite depth limit, we study 'representation geodesics' $A_{p}$: continuous paths in representation space (similar to NeuralODEs) from input $p=0$ to output $p=1$ that minimize the parameter norm of the network. We give a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian reformulation, which highlight the importance of two terms: a kinetic energy which favors small layer derivatives $\partial_{p}A_{p}$ and a potential energy that favors low-dimensional representations, as measured by the 'Cost of Identity'. The balance between these two forces offers an intuitive understanding of feature learning in ResNets. We leverage this intuition to explain the emergence of a bottleneck structure, as observed in previous work: for large $\tilde{L}$ the potential energy dominates and leads to a separation of timescales, where the representation jumps rapidly from the high dimensional inputs to a low-dimensional representation, move slowly inside the space of low-dimensional representations, before jumping back to the potentially high-dimensional outputs. Inspired by this phenomenon, we train with an adaptive layer step-size to adapt to the separation of timescales.</description>

      <title>Structured Partial Stochasticity in Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian neural network posterior distributions have a great number of modes that correspond to the same network function. The abundance of such modes can make it difficult for approximate inference methods to do their job. Recent work has demonstrated the benefits of partial stochasticity for approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks; inference can be less costly and performance can sometimes be improved. I propose a structured way to select the deterministic subset of weights that removes neuron permutation symmetries, and therefore the corresponding redundant posterior modes. With a drastically simplified posterior distribution, the performance of existing approximate inference schemes is found to be greatly improved.</description>

      <title>Tamed Langevin sampling under weaker conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to deep learning which often fail standard Lipschitz smoothness requirements, we examine the problem of sampling from distributions that are not log-concave and are only weakly dissipative, with log-gradients allowed to grow superlinearly at infinity. In terms of structure, we only assume that the target distribution satisfies either a log-Sobolev or a Poincar\'e inequality and a local Lipschitz smoothness assumption with modulus growing possibly polynomially at infinity. This set of assumptions greatly exceeds the operational limits of the "vanilla" unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), making sampling from such distributions a highly involved affair. To account for this, we introduce a taming scheme which is tailored to the growth and decay properties of the target distribution, and we provide explicit non-asymptotic guarantees for the proposed sampler in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, total variation, and Wasserstein distance to the target distribution.</description>

      <title>Spectral Truncation Kernels: Noncommutativity in $C^*$-algebraic Kernel Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new class of positive definite kernels based on the spectral truncation, which has been discussed in the fields of noncommutative geometry and $C^*$-algebra. We focus on kernels whose inputs and outputs are functions and generalize existing kernels, such as polynomial, product, and separable kernels, by introducing a truncation parameter $n$ that describes the noncommutativity of the products appearing in the kernels. When $n$ goes to infinity, the proposed kernels tend to the existing commutative kernels. If $n$ is finite, they exhibit different behavior, and the noncommutativity induces interactions along the data function domain. We show that the truncation parameter $n$ is a governing factor leading to performance enhancement: by setting an appropriate $n$, we can balance the representation power and the complexity of the representation space. The flexibility of the proposed class of kernels allows us to go beyond previous commutative kernels.</description>

      <title>Efficient Prior Calibration From Indirect Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inversion is central to the quantification of uncertainty within problems arising from numerous applications in science and engineering. To formulate the approach, four ingredients are required: a forward model mapping the unknown parameter to an element of a solution space, often the solution space for a differential equation; an observation operator mapping an element of the solution space to the data space; a noise model describing how noise pollutes the observations; and a prior model describing knowledge about the unknown parameter before the data is acquired. This paper is concerned with learning the prior model from data; in particular, learning the prior from multiple realizations of indirect data obtained through the noisy observation process. The prior is represented, using a generative model, as the pushforward of a Gaussian in a latent space; the pushforward map is learned by minimizing an appropriate loss function. A metric that is well-defined under empirical approximation is used to define the loss function for the pushforward map to make an implementable methodology. Furthermore, an efficient residual-based neural operator approximation of the forward model is proposed and it is shown that this may be learned concurrently with the pushforward map, using a bilevel optimization formulation of the problem; this use of neural operator approximation has the potential to make prior learning from indirect data more computationally efficient, especially when the observation process is expensive, non-smooth or not known. The ideas are illustrated with the Darcy flow inverse problem of finding permeability from piezometric head measurements.</description>

      <title>Is machine learning good or bad for the natural sciences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods are having a huge impact across all of the sciences. However, ML has a strong ontology - in which only the data exist - and a strong epistemology - in which a model is considered good if it performs well on held-out training data. These philosophies are in strong conflict with both standard practices and key philosophies in the natural sciences. Here, we identify some locations for ML in the natural sciences at which the ontology and epistemology are valuable. For example, when an expressive machine learning model is used in a causal inference to represent the effects of confounders, such as foregrounds, backgrounds, or instrument calibration parameters, the model capacity and loose philosophy of ML can make the results more trustworthy. We also show that there are contexts in which the introduction of ML introduces strong, unwanted statistical biases. For one, when ML models are used to emulate physical (or first-principles) simulations, they introduce strong confirmation biases. For another, when expressive regressions are used to label datasets, those labels cannot be used in downstream joint or ensemble analyses without taking on uncontrolled biases. The question in the title is being asked of all of the natural sciences; that is, we are calling on the scientific communities to take a step back and consider the role and value of ML in their fields; the (partial) answers we give here come from the particular perspective of physics.</description>

      <title>SEMF: Supervised Expectation-Maximization Framework for Predicting Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the Supervised Expectation-Maximization Framework (SEMF), a versatile and model-agnostic framework that generates prediction intervals for datasets with complete or missing data. SEMF extends the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, traditionally used in unsupervised learning, to a supervised context, enabling it to extract latent representations for uncertainty estimation. The framework demonstrates robustness through extensive empirical evaluation across 11 tabular datasets, achieving$\unicode{x2013}$in some cases$\unicode{x2013}$narrower normalized prediction intervals and higher coverage than traditional quantile regression methods. Furthermore, SEMF integrates seamlessly with existing machine learning algorithms, such as gradient-boosted trees and neural networks, exemplifying its usefulness for real-world applications. The experimental results highlight SEMF's potential to advance state-of-the-art techniques in uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Non-negative Tensor Mixture Learning for Discrete Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an expectation-maximization (EM) based unified framework for non-negative tensor decomposition that optimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To avoid iterations in each M-step and learning rate tuning, we establish a general relationship between low-rank decomposition and many-body approximation. Using this connection, we exploit that the closed-form solution of the many-body approximation can be used to update all parameters simultaneously in the M-step. Our framework not only offers a unified methodology for a variety of low-rank structures, including CP, Tucker, and Train decompositions, but also their combinations forming mixtures of tensors as well as robust adaptive noise modeling. Empirically, we demonstrate that our framework provides superior generalization for discrete density estimation compared to conventional tensor-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Adaptive debiased SGD in high-dimensional GLMs with steaming data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online statistical inference facilitates real-time analysis of sequentially collected data, making it different from traditional methods that rely on static datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach to online inference in high-dimensional generalized linear models, where we update regression coefficient estimates and their standard errors upon each new data arrival. In contrast to existing methods that either require full dataset access or large-dimensional summary statistics storage, our method operates in a single-pass mode, significantly reducing both time and space complexity. The core of our methodological innovation lies in an adaptive stochastic gradient descent algorithm tailored for dynamic objective functions, coupled with a novel online debiasing procedure. This allows us to maintain low-dimensional summary statistics while effectively controlling optimization errors introduced by the dynamically changing loss functions. We demonstrate that our method, termed the Approximated Debiased Lasso (ADL), not only mitigates the need for the bounded individual probability condition but also significantly improves numerical performance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed ADL method consistently exhibits robust performance across various covariance matrix structures.</description>

      <title>Context-Specific Refinements of Bayesian Network Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised classification is one of the most ubiquitous tasks in machine learning. Generative classifiers based on Bayesian networks are often used because of their interpretability and competitive accuracy. The widely used naive and TAN classifiers are specific instances of Bayesian network classifiers with a constrained underlying graph. This paper introduces novel classes of generative classifiers extending TAN and other famous types of Bayesian network classifiers. Our approach is based on staged tree models, which extend Bayesian networks by allowing for complex, context-specific patterns of dependence. We formally study the relationship between our novel classes of classifiers and Bayesian networks. We introduce and implement data-driven learning routines for our models and investigate their accuracy in an extensive computational study. The study demonstrates that models embedding asymmetric information can enhance classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Learning Staged Trees from Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Staged trees are probabilistic graphical models capable of representing any class of non-symmetric independence via a coloring of its vertices. Several structural learning routines have been defined and implemented to learn staged trees from data, under the frequentist or Bayesian paradigm. They assume a data set has been observed fully and, in practice, observations with missing entries are either dropped or imputed before learning the model. Here, we introduce the first algorithms for staged trees that handle missingness within the learning of the model. To this end, we characterize the likelihood of staged tree models in the presence of missing data and discuss pseudo-likelihoods that approximate it. A structural expectation-maximization algorithm estimating the model directly from the full likelihood is also implemented and evaluated. A computational experiment showcases the performance of the novel learning algorithms, demonstrating that it is feasible to account for different missingness patterns when learning staged trees.</description>

      <title>A Hessian-Aware Stochastic Differential Equation for Modelling SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time approximation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a crucial tool to study its escaping behaviors from stationary points. However, existing stochastic differential equation (SDE) models fail to fully capture these behaviors, even for simple quadratic objectives. Built on a novel stochastic backward error analysis framework, we derive the Hessian-Aware Stochastic Modified Equation (HA-SME), an SDE that incorporates Hessian information of the objective function into both its drift and diffusion terms. Our analysis shows that HA-SME matches the order-best approximation error guarantee among existing SDE models in the literature, while achieving a significantly reduced dependence on the smoothness parameter of the objective. Further, for quadratic objectives, under mild conditions, HA-SME is proved to be the first SDE model that recovers exactly the SGD dynamics in the distributional sense. Consequently, when the local landscape near a stationary point can be approximated by quadratics, HA-SME is expected to accurately predict the local escaping behaviors of SGD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PPBoot: a bootstrap-based method for prediction-powered inference. PPBoot is applicable to arbitrary estimation problems and is very simple to implement, essentially only requiring one application of the bootstrap. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate that PPBoot often performs nearly identically to (and sometimes better than) the earlier PPI(++) method based on asymptotic normality$\unicode{x2013}$when the latter is applicable$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring any asymptotic characterizations. Given its versatility, PPBoot could simplify and expand the scope of application of prediction-powered inference to problems where central limit theorems are hard to prove.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive closed-form expressions for the Bayes optimal decision boundaries in binary classification of high dimensional overlapping Gaussian mixture model (GMM) data, and show how they depend on the eigenstructure of the class covariances, for particularly interesting structured data. We empirically demonstrate, through experiments on synthetic GMMs inspired by real-world data, that deep neural networks trained for classification, learn predictors which approximate the derived optimal classifiers. We further extend our study to networks trained on authentic data, observing that decision thresholds correlate with the covariance eigenvectors rather than the eigenvalues, mirroring our GMM analysis. This provides theoretical insights regarding neural networks' ability to perform probabilistic inference and distill statistical patterns from intricate distributions.</description>

      <title>Bagging Improves Generalization Exponentially</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bagging is a popular ensemble technique to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. It hinges on the well-established rationale that, by repeatedly retraining on resampled data, the aggregated model exhibits lower variance and hence higher stability, especially for discontinuous base learners. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on bagging: By suitably aggregating the base learners at the parametrization instead of the output level, bagging improves generalization performances exponentially, a strength that is significantly more powerful than variance reduction. More precisely, we show that for general stochastic optimization problems that suffer from slowly (i.e., polynomially) decaying generalization errors, bagging can effectively reduce these errors to an exponential decay. Moreover, this power of bagging is agnostic to the solution schemes, including common empirical risk minimization, distributionally robust optimization, and various regularizations. We demonstrate how bagging can substantially improve generalization performances in a range of examples involving heavy-tailed data that suffer from intrinsically slow rates.</description>

      <title>CrEIMBO: Cross Ensemble Interactions in Multi-view Brain Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recordings of neural activity provide diverse observations of neurons across brain areas, behavioral conditions, and subjects -- thus presenting an exciting opportunity to reveal the fundamentals of brain-wide dynamics underlying cognitive function. Current methods, however, often fail to fully harness the richness of such data as they either provide an uninterpretable representation (e.g., via "black box" deep networks) or over-simplify the model (e.g., assume stationary dynamics or analyze each session independently). Here, instead of regarding asynchronous recordings that lack alignment in neural identity or brain areas as a limitation, we exploit these diverse views of the same brain system to learn a unified model of brain dynamics. We assume that brain observations stem from the joint activity of a set of functional neural ensembles (groups of co-active neurons) that are similar in functionality across recordings, and propose to discover the ensemble and their non-stationary dynamical interactions in a new model we term CrEIMBO (Cross-Ensemble Interactions in Multi-view Brain Observations). CrEIMBO identifies the composition of the per-session neural ensembles through graph-driven dictionary learning and models the ensemble dynamics as a latent sparse time-varying decomposition of global sub-circuits, thereby capturing non-stationary dynamics. CrEIMBO identifies multiple co-active sub-circuits while maintaining representation interpretability due to sharing sub-circuits across sessions. CrEIMBO distinguishes session-specific from global (session-invariant) computations by exploring when distinct sub-circuits are active. We demonstrate CrEIMBO's ability to recover ground truth components in synthetic data and uncover meaningful brain dynamics, capturing cross-subject and inter- and intra-area variability, in high-density electrode recordings of humans performing a memory task.</description>

      <title>WeatherFormer: A Pretrained Encoder Model for Learning Robust Weather Representations from Small Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces WeatherFormer, a transformer encoder-based model designed to learn robust weather features from minimal observations. It addresses the challenge of modeling complex weather dynamics from small datasets, a bottleneck for many prediction tasks in agriculture, epidemiology, and climate science. WeatherFormer was pretrained on a large pretraining dataset comprised of 39 years of satellite measurements across the Americas. With a novel pretraining task and fine-tuning, WeatherFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in county-level soybean yield prediction and influenza forecasting. Technical innovations include a unique spatiotemporal encoding that captures geographical, annual, and seasonal variations, adapting the transformer architecture to continuous weather data, and a pretraining strategy to learn representations that are robust to missing weather features. This paper for the first time demonstrates the effectiveness of pretraining large transformer encoder models for weather-dependent applications across multiple domains.</description>

      <title>Data Valuation by Leveraging Global and Local Statistical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data valuation has garnered increasing attention in recent years, given the critical role of high-quality data in various applications, particularly in machine learning tasks. There are diverse technical avenues to quantify the value of data within a corpus. While Shapley value-based methods are among the most widely used techniques in the literature due to their solid theoretical foundation, the accurate calculation of Shapley values is often intractable, leading to the proposal of numerous approximated calculation methods. Despite significant progress, nearly all existing methods overlook the utilization of distribution information of values within a data corpus. In this paper, we demonstrate that both global and local statistical information of value distributions hold significant potential for data valuation within the context of machine learning. Firstly, we explore the characteristics of both global and local value distributions across several simulated and real data corpora. Useful observations and clues are obtained. Secondly, we propose a new data valuation method that estimates Shapley values by incorporating the explored distribution characteristics into an existing method, AME. Thirdly, we present a new path to address the dynamic data valuation problem by formulating an optimization problem that integrates information of both global and local value distributions. Extensive experiments are conducted on Shapley value estimation, value-based data removal/adding, mislabeled data detection, and incremental/decremental data valuation. The results showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methodologies, affirming the significant potential of global and local value distributions in data valuation.</description>

      <title>ROSE: Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting with Decomposed Frequency Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing collection of time series data from various domains, there arises a strong demand for general time series forecasting models pre-trained on a large number of time-series datasets to support a variety of downstream prediction tasks. Enabling general time series forecasting faces two challenges: how to obtain unified representations from multi-domian time series data, and how to capture domain-specific features from time series data across various domains for adaptive transfer in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a Register Assisted General Time Series Forecasting Model with Decomposed Frequency Learning (ROSE), a novel pre-trained model for time series forecasting. ROSE employs Decomposed Frequency Learning for the pre-training task, which decomposes coupled semantic and periodic information in time series with frequency-based masking and reconstruction to obtain unified representations across domains. We also equip ROSE with a Time Series Register, which learns to generate a register codebook to capture domain-specific representations during pre-training and enhances domain-adaptive transfer by selecting related register tokens on downstream tasks. After pre-training on large-scale time series data, ROSE achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 8 real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, even in few-shot scenarios, it demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods trained with full data.</description>

      <title>A rationale from frequency perspective for grokking in training neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grokking is the phenomenon where neural networks NNs initially fit the training data and later generalize to the test data during training. In this paper, we empirically provide a frequency perspective to explain the emergence of this phenomenon in NNs. The core insight is that the networks initially learn the less salient frequency components present in the test data. We observe this phenomenon across both synthetic and real datasets, offering a novel viewpoint for elucidating the grokking phenomenon by characterizing it through the lens of frequency dynamics during the training process. Our empirical frequency-based analysis sheds new light on understanding the grokking phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Revisit, Extend, and Enhance Hessian-Free Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence functions serve as crucial tools for assessing sample influence in model interpretation, subset training set selection, noisy label detection, and more. By employing the first-order Taylor extension, influence functions can estimate sample influence without the need for expensive model retraining. However, applying influence functions directly to deep models presents challenges, primarily due to the non-convex nature of the loss function and the large size of model parameters. This difficulty not only makes computing the inverse of the Hessian matrix costly but also renders it non-existent in some cases. Various approaches, including matrix decomposition, have been explored to expedite and approximate the inversion of the Hessian matrix, with the aim of making influence functions applicable to deep models. In this paper, we revisit a specific, albeit naive, yet effective approximation method known as TracIn. This method substitutes the inverse of the Hessian matrix with an identity matrix. We provide deeper insights into why this simple approximation method performs well. Furthermore, we extend its applications beyond measuring model utility to include considerations of fairness and robustness. Finally, we enhance TracIn through an ensemble strategy. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on synthetic data and extensive evaluations on noisy label detection, sample selection for large language model fine-tuning, and defense against adversarial attacks.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the impact of different masking strategies on time series imputation models. We evaluate the effects of pre-masking versus in-mini-batch masking, normalization timing, and the choice between augmenting and overlaying artificial missingness. Using three diverse datasets, we benchmark eleven imputation models with different missing rates. Our results demonstrate that masking strategies significantly influence imputation accuracy, revealing that more sophisticated and data-driven masking designs are essential for robust model evaluation. We advocate for refined experimental designs and comprehensive disclosureto better simulate real-world patterns, enhancing the practical applicability of imputation models.</description>

      <title>WASH: Train your Ensemble with Communication-Efficient Weight Shuffling, then Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is enhanced by ensemble methods, which average the output of several models. However, this comes at an increased cost at inference. Weight averaging methods aim at balancing the generalization of ensembling and the inference speed of a single model by averaging the parameters of an ensemble of models. Yet, naive averaging results in poor performance as models converge to different loss basins, and aligning the models to improve the performance of the average is challenging. Alternatively, inspired by distributed training, methods like DART and PAPA have been proposed to train several models in parallel such that they will end up in the same basin, resulting in good averaging accuracy. However, these methods either compromise ensembling accuracy or demand significant communication between models during training. In this paper, we introduce WASH, a novel distributed method for training model ensembles for weight averaging that achieves state-of-the-art image classification accuracy. WASH maintains models within the same basin by randomly shuffling a small percentage of weights during training, resulting in diverse models and lower communication costs compared to standard parameter averaging methods.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Dataset Condensation for Faster Hyperparameter Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset condensation can be used to reduce the computational cost of training multiple models on a large dataset by condensing the training dataset into a small synthetic set. State-of-the-art approaches rely on matching the model gradients between the real and synthetic data. However, there is no theoretical guarantee of the generalizability of the condensed data: data condensation often generalizes poorly across hyperparameters/architectures in practice. This paper considers a different condensation objective specifically geared toward hyperparameter search. We aim to generate a synthetic validation dataset so that the validation-performance rankings of the models, with different hyperparameters, on the condensed and original datasets are comparable. We propose a novel hyperparameter-calibrated dataset condensation (HCDC) algorithm, which obtains the synthetic validation dataset by matching the hyperparameter gradients computed via implicit differentiation and efficient inverse Hessian approximation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively maintains the validation-performance rankings of models and speeds up hyperparameter/architecture search for tasks on both images and graphs.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Prognostics with Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning approaches have recently been extensively explored for the prognostics of industrial assets. However, they still suffer from a lack of interpretability, which hinders their adoption in safety-critical applications. To improve their trustworthiness, explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been applied in prognostics, primarily to quantify the importance of input variables for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) using post-hoc attribution methods. In this work, we propose the application of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), a family of inherently interpretable neural network architectures based on concept explanations, to the task of RUL prediction. Unlike attribution methods, which explain decisions in terms of low-level input features, concepts represent high-level information that is easily understandable by users. Moreover, once verified in actual applications, CBMs enable domain experts to intervene on the concept activations at test-time. We propose using the different degradation modes of an asset as intermediate concepts. Our case studies on the New Commercial Modular AeroPropulsion System Simulation (N-CMAPSS) aircraft engine dataset for RUL prediction demonstrate that the performance of CBMs can be on par or superior to black-box models, while being more interpretable, even when the available labeled concepts are limited.

      <title>Mixed Dynamics In Linear Networks: Unifying the Lazy and Active Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training dynamics of linear networks are well studied in two distinct setups: the lazy regime and balanced/active regime, depending on the initialization and width of the network. We provide a surprisingly simple unyfing formula for the evolution of the learned matrix that contains as special cases both lazy and balanced regimes but also a mixed regime in between the two. In the mixed regime, a part of the network is lazy while the other is balanced. More precisely the network is lazy along singular values that are below a certain threshold and balanced along those that are above the same threshold. At initialization, all singular values are lazy, allowing for the network to align itself with the task, so that later in time, when some of the singular value cross the threshold and become active they will converge rapidly (convergence in the balanced regime is notoriously difficult in the absence of alignment). The mixed regime is the `best of both worlds': it converges from any random initialization (in contrast to balanced dynamics which require special initialization), and has a low rank bias (absent in the lazy dynamics). This allows us to prove an almost complete phase diagram of training behavior as a function of the variance at initialization and the width, for a MSE training task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the real world, data is often noisy, affecting not only the quality of features but also the accuracy of labels. Current research on mitigating label errors stems primarily from advances in deep learning, and a gap exists in exploring interpretable models, particularly those rooted in decision trees. In this study, we investigate whether ideas from deep learning loss design can be applied to improve the robustness of decision trees. In particular, we show that loss correction and symmetric losses, both standard approaches, are not effective. We argue that other directions need to be explored to improve the robustness of decision trees to label noise.</description>

      <title>Fast Samplers for Inverse Problems in Iterative Refinement Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing fast samplers for unconditional diffusion and flow-matching models has received much attention recently; however, existing methods for solving inverse problems, such as super-resolution, inpainting, or deblurring, still require hundreds to thousands of iterative steps to obtain high-quality results. We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4$\times$ super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mandt-lab/CI2RM.</description>

      <title>OPERA: Automatic Offline Policy Evaluation with Re-weighted Aggregates of Multiple Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline policy evaluation (OPE) allows us to evaluate and estimate a new sequential decision-making policy's performance by leveraging historical interaction data collected from other policies. Evaluating a new policy online without a confident estimate of its performance can lead to costly, unsafe, or hazardous outcomes, especially in education and healthcare. Several OPE estimators have been proposed in the last decade, many of which have hyperparameters and require training. Unfortunately, choosing the best OPE algorithm for each task and domain is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that adaptively blends a set of OPE estimators given a dataset without relying on an explicit selection using a statistical procedure. We prove that our estimator is consistent and satisfies several desirable properties for policy evaluation. Additionally, we demonstrate that when compared to alternative approaches, our estimator can be used to select higher-performing policies in healthcare and robotics. Our work contributes to improving ease of use for a general-purpose, estimator-agnostic, off-policy evaluation framework for offline RL.</description>

      <title>Linguistic Collapse: Neural Collapse in (Large) Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) is a phenomenon observed in classification tasks where top-layer representations collapse into their class means, which become equinorm, equiangular and aligned with the classifiers. These behaviors -- associated with generalization and robustness -- would manifest under specific conditions: models are trained towards zero loss, with noise-free labels belonging to balanced classes, which do not outnumber the model's hidden dimension. Recent studies have explored $\mathcal{NC}$ in the absence of one or more of these conditions to extend and capitalize on the associated benefits of ideal geometries. Language modeling presents a curious frontier, as \textit{training by token prediction} constitutes a classification task where none of the conditions exist: the vocabulary is imbalanced and exceeds the embedding dimension; different tokens might correspond to similar contextual embeddings; and large language models (LLMs) in particular are typically only trained for a few epochs. This paper empirically investigates the impact of scaling the architectures and training of causal language models (CLMs) on their progression towards $\mathcal{NC}$. We find that $\mathcal{NC}$ properties that develop with scaling are linked to generalization. Moreover, there is evidence of some relationship between $\mathcal{NC}$ and generalization independent of scale. Our work therefore underscores the generality of $\mathcal{NC}$ as it extends to the novel and more challenging setting of language modeling. Downstream, we seek to inspire further research on the phenomenon to deepen our understanding of LLMs -- and neural networks at large -- and improve existing architectures based on $\mathcal{NC}$-related properties.</description>

      <title>Offline Oracle-Efficient Learning for Contextual MDPs via Layerwise Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of a statistical and computational reduction from contextual bandits to offline regression (Simchi-Levi and Xu, 2021), we address the general (stochastic) Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem with horizon H (as known as CMDP with H layers). In this paper, we introduce a reduction from CMDPs to offline density estimation under the realizability assumption, i.e., a model class M containing the true underlying CMDP is provided in advance. We develop an efficient, statistically near-optimal algorithm requiring only O(HlogT) calls to an offline density estimation algorithm (or oracle) across all T rounds of interaction. This number can be further reduced to O(HloglogT) if T is known in advance. Our results mark the first efficient and near-optimal reduction from CMDPs to offline density estimation without imposing any structural assumptions on the model class. A notable feature of our algorithm is the design of a layerwise exploration-exploitation tradeoff tailored to address the layerwise structure of CMDPs. Additionally, our algorithm is versatile and applicable to pure exploration tasks in reward-free reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Step-Size Assumptions in Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning and optimization algorithms are built upon the framework of stochastic approximation (SA), for which the selection of step-size (or learning rate) is essential for success. For the sake of clarity, this paper focuses on the special case $\alpha_n = \alpha_0 n^{-\rho}$ at iteration $n$, with $\rho \in [0,1]$ and $\alpha_0&gt;0$ design parameters. It is most common in practice to take $\rho=0$ (constant step-size), while in more theoretically oriented papers a vanishing step-size is preferred. In particular, with $\rho \in (1/2, 1)$ it is known that on applying the averaging technique of Polyak and Ruppert, the mean-squared error (MSE) converges at the optimal rate of $O(1/n)$ and the covariance in the central limit theorem (CLT) is minimal in a precise sense.
  The paper revisits step-size selection in a general Markovian setting. Under readily verifiable assumptions, the following conclusions are obtained provided $0&lt;\rho&lt;1$:
  $\bullet$ Parameter estimates converge with probability one, and also in $L_p$ for any $p\ge 1$.
  $\bullet$ The MSE may converge very slowly for small $\rho$, of order $O(\alpha_n^2)$ even with averaging.
  $\bullet$ For linear stochastic approximation the source of slow convergence is identified: for any $\rho\in (0,1)$, averaging results in estimates for which the error $\textit{covariance}$ vanishes at the optimal rate, and moreover the
  CLT covariance is optimal in the sense of Polyak and Ruppert. However, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained under which the $\textit{bias}$ converges to zero at rate $O(\alpha_n)$.
  This is the first paper to obtain such strong conclusions while allowing for $\rho \le 1/2$. A major conclusion is that the choice of $\rho =0$ or even $\rho&lt;1/2$ is justified only in select settings -- In general, bias may preclude fast convergence.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Wav-KAN) in federated learning. We implemented Wav-KAN \cite{wav-kan} in the clients. Indeed, we have considered both continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and also discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to enable multiresolution capabaility which helps in heteregeneous data distribution across clients. Extensive experiments were conducted on different datasets, demonstrating Wav-KAN's superior performance in terms of interpretability, computational speed, training and test accuracy. Our federated learning algorithm integrates wavelet-based activation functions, parameterized by weight, scale, and translation, to enhance local and global model performance. Results show significant improvements in computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of wavelet selection in scalable neural network design.</description>

      <title>Towards robust prediction of material properties for nuclear reactor design under scarce data -- a study in creep rupture property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in Deep Learning bring further investigation into credibility and robustness, especially for safety-critical engineering applications such as the nuclear industry. The key challenges include the availability of data set (often scarce and sparse) and insufficient consideration of the uncertainty in the data, model, and prediction. This paper therefore presents a meta-learning based approach that is both uncertainty- and prior knowledge-informed, aiming at trustful predictions of material properties for the nuclear reactor design. It is suited for robust learning under limited data. Uncertainty has been accounted for where a distribution of predictor functions are produced for extrapolation. Results suggest it achieves superior performance than existing empirical methods in rupture life prediction, a case which is typically under a small data regime. While demonstrated herein with rupture properties, this learning approach is transferable to solve similar problems of data scarcity across the nuclear industry. It is of great importance to boosting the AI analytics in the nuclear industry by proving the applicability and robustness while providing tools that can be trusted.</description>

Abstract: We provide a novel dimension-free uniform concentration bound for the empirical risk function of constrained logistic regression. Our bound yields a milder sufficient condition for a uniform law of large numbers than conditions derived by the Rademacher complexity argument and McDiarmid's inequality. The derivation is based on the PAC-Bayes approach with second-order expansion and Rademacher-complexity-based bounds for the residual term of the expansion.</description>

      <title>Implicitly Guided Design with PropEn: Match your Data to Follow the Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across scientific domains, generating new models or optimizing existing ones while meeting specific criteria is crucial. Traditional machine learning frameworks for guided design use a generative model and a surrogate model (discriminator), requiring large datasets. However, real-world scientific applications often have limited data and complex landscapes, making data-hungry models inefficient or impractical. We propose a new framework, PropEn, inspired by ``matching'', which enables implicit guidance without training a discriminator. By matching each sample with a similar one that has a better property value, we create a larger training dataset that inherently indicates the direction of improvement. Matching, combined with an encoder-decoder architecture, forms a domain-agnostic generative framework for property enhancement. We show that training with a matched dataset approximates the gradient of the property of interest while remaining within the data distribution, allowing efficient design optimization. Extensive evaluations in toy problems and scientific applications, such as therapeutic protein design and airfoil optimization, demonstrate PropEn's advantages over common baselines. Notably, the protein design results are validated with wet lab experiments, confirming the competitiveness and effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a rank one signal matrix from an observed matrix generated by corrupting the signal with additive rotationally invariant noise. We develop a new class of approximate message-passing algorithms for this problem and provide a simple and concise characterization of their dynamics in the high-dimensional limit. At each iteration, these algorithms exploit prior knowledge about the noise structure by applying a non-linear matrix denoiser to the eigenvalues of the observed matrix and prior information regarding the signal structure by applying a non-linear iterate denoiser to the previous iterates generated by the algorithm. We exploit our result on the dynamics of these algorithms to derive the optimal choices for the matrix and iterate denoisers. We show that the resulting algorithm achieves the smallest possible asymptotic estimation error among a broad class of iterative algorithms under a fixed iteration budget.</description>

      <title>Graph Coarsening with Message-Passing Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to reduce the size of a large graph while preserving some of its key properties, which has been used in many applications to reduce computational load and memory footprint. For instance, in graph machine learning, training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on coarsened graphs leads to drastic savings in time and memory. However, GNNs rely on the Message-Passing (MP) paradigm, and classical spectral preservation guarantees for graph coarsening do not directly lead to theoretical guarantees when performing naive message-passing on the coarsened graph. In this work, we propose a new message-passing operation specific to coarsened graphs, which exhibit theoretical guarantees on the preservation of the propagated signal. Interestingly, and in a sharp departure from previous proposals, this operation on coarsened graphs is oriented, even when the original graph is undirected. We conduct node classification tasks on synthetic and real data and observe improved results compared to performing naive message-passing on the coarsened graph.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a natural policy gradient method based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for partially-observable Markov decision processes, whereby RNNs are used for policy parameterization and policy evaluation to address curse of dimensionality in non-Markovian reinforcement learning. We present finite-time and finite-width analyses for both the critic (recurrent temporal difference learning), and correspondingly-operated recurrent natural policy gradient method in the near-initialization regime. Our analysis demonstrates the efficiency of RNNs for problems with short-term memory with explicit bounds on the required network widths and sample complexity, and points out the challenges in the case of long-term dependencies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cycloid Trajectory of EM Iterations in Mixed Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the trajectory of iterations and the convergence rates of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR). The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlinear spiked random matrix model where a nonlinear function is applied element-wise to a noise matrix perturbed by a rank-one signal. We establish a signal-plus-noise decomposition for this model and identify precise phase transitions in the structure of the signal components at critical thresholds of signal strength. To demonstrate the applicability of this decomposition, we then utilize it to study new phenomena in the problems of signed signal recovery in nonlinear models and community detection in transformed stochastic block models. Finally, we validate our results through a series of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Stagewise Boosting Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward stagewise regression is a simple algorithm that can be used to estimate regularized models. The updating rule adds a small constant to a regression coefficient in each iteration, such that the underlying optimization problem is solved slowly with small improvements. This is similar to gradient boosting, with the essential difference that the step size is determined by the product of the gradient and a step length parameter in the latter algorithm. One often overlooked challenge in gradient boosting for distributional regression is the issue of a vanishing small gradient, which practically halts the algorithm's progress. We show that gradient boosting in this case oftentimes results in suboptimal models, especially for complex problems certain distributional parameters are never updated due to the vanishing gradient. Therefore, we propose a stagewise boosting-type algorithm for distributional regression, combining stagewise regression ideas with gradient boosting. Additionally, we extend it with a novel regularization method, correlation filtering, to provide additional stability when the problem involves a large number of covariates. Furthermore, the algorithm includes best-subset selection for parameters and can be applied to big data problems by leveraging stochastic approximations of the updating steps. Besides the advantage of processing large datasets, the stochastic nature of the approximations can lead to better results, especially for complex distributions, by reducing the risk of being trapped in a local optimum. The performance of our proposed stagewise boosting distributional regression approach is investigated in an extensive simulation study and by estimating a full probabilistic model for lightning counts with data of more than 9.1 million observations and 672 covariates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning systems often acquire biases by leveraging undesired features in the data, impacting accuracy variably across different sub-populations. Current understanding of bias formation mostly focuses on the initial and final stages of learning, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the transient dynamics. To address this gap, this paper explores the evolution of bias in a teacher-student setup modeling different data sub-populations with a Gaussian-mixture model. We provide an analytical description of the stochastic gradient descent dynamics of a linear classifier in this setting, which we prove to be exact in high dimension. Notably, our analysis reveals how different properties of sub-populations influence bias at different timescales, showing a shifting preference of the classifier during training. Applying our findings to fairness and robustness, we delineate how and when heterogeneous data and spurious features can generate and amplify bias. We empirically validate our results in more complex scenarios by training deeper networks on synthetic and real datasets, including CIFAR10, MNIST, and CelebA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are a versatile probabilistic machine learning model whose effectiveness often depends on good hyperparameters, which are typically learned by maximising the marginal likelihood. In this work, we consider iterative methods, which use iterative linear system solvers to approximate marginal likelihood gradients up to a specified numerical precision, allowing a trade-off between compute time and accuracy of a solution. We introduce a three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, and identify that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations. We then propose to amortise computations by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, providing a $\textit{warm start}$. Finally, we discuss the necessary conditions and quantify the consequences of warm starts and demonstrate their effectiveness on regression tasks, where warm starts achieve the same results as the conventional procedure while providing up to a $16 \times$ average speed-up among datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion bridge is a type of diffusion process that conditions on hitting a specific state within a finite time period. It has broad applications in fields such as Bayesian inference, financial mathematics, control theory, and shape analysis. However, simulating the diffusion bridge for natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain unresolved. In the paper, we present a solution to this problem by merging score-matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to score-matching for the infinite-dimensional bridge. We construct the score to be discretization invariant, which is natural given the underlying spatially continuous process. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data, and our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms require discriminative boundaries, such as separating hyperplanes or hyperballs, or are specifically designed to work on spherical data. By applying inversive geometry, we show that the two discriminative boundaries can be used interchangeably, and that general Euclidean data can be transformed into spherical data, whenever a change in point distances is acceptable. We provide explicit formulae to embed general Euclidean data into spherical data and to unembed it back. We further show a duality between hyperspherical caps, i.e., the volume created by a separating hyperplane on spherical data, and hyperballs and provide explicit formulae to map between the two. We further provide equations to translate inner products and Euclidean distances between the two spaces, to avoid explicit embedding and unembedding. We also provide a method to enforce projections of the general Euclidean space onto hemi-hyperspheres and propose an intrinsic dimensionality based method to obtain "all-purpose" parameters. To show the usefulness of the cap-ball-duality, we discuss example applications in machine learning and vector similarity search.</description>

Abstract: Large amount of multidimensional data represented by multiway arrays or tensors are prevalent in modern applications across various fields such as chemometrics, genomics, physics, psychology, and signal processing. The structural complexity of such data provides vast new opportunities for modeling and analysis, but efficiently extracting information content from them, both statistically and computationally, presents unique and fundamental challenges. Addressing these challenges requires an interdisciplinary approach that brings together tools and insights from statistics, optimization and numerical linear algebra among other fields. Despite these hurdles, significant progress has been made in the last decade. This review seeks to examine some of the key advancements and identify common threads among them, under eight different statistical settings.</description>

Abstract: Temporal data are increasingly prevalent in modern data science. A fundamental question is whether two time series are related or not. Existing approaches often have limitations, such as relying on parametric assumptions, detecting only linear associations, and requiring multiple tests and corrections. While many non-parametric and universally consistent dependence measures have recently been proposed, directly applying them to temporal data can inflate the p-value and result in an invalid test. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the temporal dependence statistic with block permutation to test independence between temporal data. Under proper assumptions, the proposed procedure is asymptotically valid and universally consistent for testing independence between stationary time series, and capable of estimating the optimal dependence lag that maximizes the dependence. Moreover, it is compatible with a rich family of distance and kernel based dependence measures, eliminates the need for multiple testing, and exhibits excellent testing power in various simulation settings.</description>

Abstract: Much of the causal discovery literature prioritises guaranteeing the identifiability of causal direction in statistical models. For structures within a Markov equivalence class, this requires strong assumptions which may not hold in real-world datasets, ultimately limiting the usability of these methods. Building on previous attempts, we show how to incorporate causal assumptions within the Bayesian framework. Identifying causal direction then becomes a Bayesian model selection problem. This enables us to construct models with realistic assumptions, and consequently allows for the differentiation between Markov equivalent causal structures. We analyse why Bayesian model selection works in situations where methods based on maximum likelihood fail. To demonstrate our approach, we construct a Bayesian non-parametric model that can flexibly model the joint distribution. We then outperform previous methods on a wide range of benchmark datasets with varying data generating assumptions.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Model of Neural Scaling Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a variety of tasks, the performance of neural networks predictably improves with training time, dataset size and model size across many orders of magnitude. This phenomenon is known as a neural scaling law. Of fundamental importance is the compute-optimal scaling law, which reports the performance as a function of units of compute when choosing model sizes optimally. We analyze a random feature model trained with gradient descent as a solvable model of network training and generalization. This reproduces many observations about neural scaling laws. First, our model makes a prediction about why the scaling of performance with training time and with model size have different power law exponents. Consequently, the theory predicts an asymmetric compute-optimal scaling rule where the number of training steps are increased faster than model parameters, consistent with recent empirical observations. Second, it has been observed that early in training, networks converge to their infinite-width dynamics at a rate $1/\textit{width}$ but at late time exhibit a rate $\textit{width}^{-c}$, where $c$ depends on the structure of the architecture and task. We show that our model exhibits this behavior. Lastly, our theory shows how the gap between training and test loss can gradually build up over time due to repeated reuse of data.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a method for online conformal prediction with decaying step sizes. Like previous methods, ours possesses a retrospective guarantee of coverage for arbitrary sequences. However, unlike previous methods, we can simultaneously estimate a population quantile when it exists. Our theory and experiments indicate substantially improved practical properties: in particular, when the distribution is stable, the coverage is close to the desired level for every time point, not just on average over the observed sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the data-generating mechanism for reconstructive SSL to shed light on its effectiveness. With an infinite amount of labeled samples, we provide a sufficient and necessary condition for perfect linear approximation. The condition reveals a full-rank component that preserves the label classes of Y, along with a redundant component. Motivated by the condition, we propose to approximate the redundant component by a low-rank factorization and measure the approximation quality by introducing a new quantity $\epsilon_s$, parameterized by the rank of factorization s. We incorporate $\epsilon_s$ into the excess risk analysis under both linear regression and ridge regression settings, where the latter regularization approach is to handle scenarios when the dimension of the learned features is much larger than the number of labeled samples n for downstream tasks. We design three stylized experiments to compare SSL with supervised learning under different settings to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon score-based learning, new interest in stochastic localization techniques has recently emerged. In these models, one seeks to noise a sample from the data distribution through a stochastic process, called observation process, and progressively learns a denoiser associated to this dynamics. Apart from specific applications, the use of stochastic localization for the problem of sampling from an unnormalized target density has not been explored extensively. This work contributes to fill this gap. We consider a general stochastic localization framework and introduce an explicit class of observation processes, associated with flexible denoising schedules. We provide a complete methodology, $\textit{Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior Sampling}$ (SLIPS), to obtain approximate samples of this dynamics, and as a by-product, samples from the target distribution. Our scheme is based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation of the denoiser and comes with detailed practical guidelines. We illustrate the benefits and applicability of SLIPS on several benchmarks of multi-modal distributions, including Gaussian mixtures in increasing dimensions, Bayesian logistic regression and a high-dimensional field system from statistical-mechanics.</description>

      <title>Neural Dynamic Data Valuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data constitute the foundational component of the data economy and its marketplaces. Efficient and fair data valuation has emerged as a topic of significant interest.\ Many approaches based on marginal contribution have shown promising results in various downstream tasks. However, they are well known to be computationally expensive as they require training a large number of utility functions, which are used to evaluate the usefulness or value of a given dataset for a specific purpose. As a result, it has been recognized as infeasible to apply these methods to a data marketplace involving large-scale datasets. Consequently, a critical issue arises: how can the re-training of the utility function be avoided? To address this issue, we propose a novel data valuation method from the perspective of optimal control, named the neural dynamic data valuation (NDDV). Our method has solid theoretical interpretations to accurately identify the data valuation via the sensitivity of the data optimal control state. In addition, we implement a data re-weighting strategy to capture the unique features of data points, ensuring fairness through the interaction between data points and the mean-field states. Notably, our method requires only training once to estimate the value of all data points, significantly improving the computational efficiency. We conduct comprehensive experiments using different datasets and tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed NDDV method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art data valuation methods in accurately identifying data points with either high or low values and is more computationally efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a novel, provably robust, and closed-form Bayesian update rule for online filtering in state-space models in the presence of outliers and misspecified measurement models. Our method combines generalised Bayesian inference with filtering methods such as the extended and ensemble Kalman filter. We use the former to show robustness and the latter to ensure computational efficiency in the case of nonlinear models. Our method matches or outperforms other robust filtering methods (such as those based on variational Bayes) at a much lower computational cost. We show this empirically on a range of filtering problems with outlier measurements, such as object tracking, state estimation in high-dimensional chaotic systems, and online learning of neural networks.</description>

Abstract: The saturation effect refers to the phenomenon that the kernel ridge regression (KRR) fails to achieve the information theoretical lower bound when the smoothness of the underground truth function exceeds certain level. The saturation effect has been widely observed in practices and a saturation lower bound of KRR has been conjectured for decades. In this paper, we provide a proof of this long-standing conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many scientific datasets are compositional in nature. Important biological examples include species abundances in ecology, cell-type compositions derived from single-cell sequencing data, and amplicon abundance data in microbiome research. Here, we provide a causal view on compositional data in an instrumental variable setting where the composition acts as the cause. First, we crisply articulate potential pitfalls for practitioners regarding the interpretation of compositional causes from the viewpoint of interventions and warn against attributing causal meaning to common summary statistics such as diversity indices in microbiome data analysis. We then advocate for and develop multivariate methods using statistical data transformations and regression techniques that take the special structure of the compositional sample space into account while still yielding scientifically interpretable results. In a comparative analysis on synthetic and real microbiome data we show the advantages and limitations of our proposal. We posit that our analysis provides a useful framework and guidance for valid and informative cause-effect estimation in the context of compositional data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic gradient descents on the space of large symmetric matrices of suitable functions that are invariant under permuting the rows and columns using the same permutation. We establish deterministic limits of these random curves as the dimensions of the matrices go to infinity while the entries remain bounded. Under a ``small noise'' assumption the limit is shown to be the gradient flow of functions on graphons whose existence was established in~\cite{oh2021gradient}. We also consider limits of stochastic gradient descents with added properly scaled reflected Brownian noise. The limiting curve of graphons is characterized by a family of stochastic differential equations with reflections and can be thought of as an extension of the classical McKean-Vlasov limit for interacting diffusions to the graphon setting. The proofs introduce a family of infinite-dimensional exchangeable arrays of reflected diffusions and a novel notion of propagation of chaos for large matrices of diffusions converging to such arrays in a suitable sense.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between adversarial robustness and differential privacy in high-dimensional algorithmic statistics. We give the first black-box reduction from privacy to robustness which can produce private estimators with optimal tradeoffs among sample complexity, accuracy, and privacy for a wide range of fundamental high-dimensional parameter estimation problems, including mean and covariance estimation. We show that this reduction can be implemented in polynomial time in some important special cases. In particular, using nearly-optimal polynomial-time robust estimators for the mean and covariance of high-dimensional Gaussians which are based on the Sum-of-Squares method, we design the first polynomial-time private estimators for these problems with nearly-optimal samples-accuracy-privacy tradeoffs. Our algorithms are also robust to a nearly optimal fraction of adversarially-corrupted samples.</description>

      <title>Density-Softmax: Efficient Test-time Model for Uncertainty Estimation and Robustness under Distribution Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based methods, e.g., Deep Ensembles and Bayesian Neural Nets have become promising approaches to improve the quality of uncertainty estimation and robust generalization. However, they suffer from a large model size and high latency at test-time, which limits the scalability needed for low-resource devices and real-time applications. To resolve these computational issues, we propose Density-Softmax, a sampling-free deterministic framework via combining a density function built on a Lipschitz-constrained feature extractor with the softmax layer. Theoretically, we show that our model is the solution of minimax uncertainty risk and is distance-aware on feature space, thus reducing the over-confidence of the standard softmax under distribution shifts. Empirically, our method enjoys competitive results with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of uncertainty and robustness, while having a lower number of model parameters and a lower latency at test-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology for using unlabeled data to design semi supervised learning (SSL) methods that improve the prediction performance of supervised learning for regression tasks. The main idea is to design different mechanisms for integrating the unlabeled data, and include in each of them a mixing parameter $\alpha$, controlling the weight given to the unlabeled data. Focusing on Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and linear interpolators classes of models, we analyze the characteristics of different mixing mechanisms, and prove that in all cases, it is invariably beneficial to integrate the unlabeled data with some nonzero mixing ratio $\alpha&gt;0$, in terms of predictive performance. Moreover, we provide a rigorous framework to estimate the best mixing ratio $\alpha^*$ where mixed SSL delivers the best predictive performance, while using the labeled and unlabeled data on hand.
  The effectiveness of our methodology in delivering substantial improvement compared to the standard supervised models, in a variety of settings, is demonstrated empirically through extensive simulation, in a manner that supports the theoretical analysis. We also demonstrate the applicability of our methodology (with some intuitive modifications) to improve more complex models, such as deep neural networks, in real-world regression tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When predictions are performative, the choice of which predictor to deploy influences the distribution of future observations. The overarching goal in learning under performativity is to find a predictor that has low \emph{performative risk}, that is, good performance on its induced distribution. One family of solutions for optimizing the performative risk, including bandits and other derivative-free methods, is agnostic to any structure in the performative feedback, leading to exceedingly slow convergence rates. A complementary family of solutions makes use of explicit \emph{models} for the feedback, such as best-response models in strategic classification, enabling faster rates. However, these rates critically rely on the feedback model being correct. In this work we study a general protocol for making use of possibly misspecified models in performative prediction, called \emph{plug-in performative optimization}. We show this solution can be far superior to model-agnostic strategies, as long as the misspecification is not too extreme. Our results support the hypothesis that models, even if misspecified, can indeed help with learning in performative settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks are typically used to learn from data that lives on a graph. However, for any graph $G$ that has $n$ vertices, using the symmetric group $S_n$ as its group of symmetries does not take into account the relations that exist between the vertices. Given that the actual group of symmetries is the automorphism group Aut$(G)$, we show how to construct neural networks that are equivariant to Aut$(G)$ by obtaining a full characterisation of the learnable, linear, Aut$(G)$-equivariant functions between layers that are some tensor power of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In particular, we find a spanning set of matrices for these layer functions in the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This result has important consequences for learning from data whose group of symmetries is a finite group because a theorem by Frucht (1938) showed that any finite group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of a graph.</description>

      <title>A Best-of-both-worlds Algorithm for Bandits with Delayed Feedback with Robustness to Excessive Delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new best-of-both-worlds algorithm for bandits with variably delayed feedback. In contrast to prior work, which required prior knowledge of the maximal delay $d_{\mathrm{max}}$ and had a linear dependence of the regret on it, our algorithm can tolerate arbitrary excessive delays up to order $T$ (where $T$ is the time horizon). The algorithm is based on three technical innovations, which may all be of independent interest: (1) We introduce the first implicit exploration scheme that works in best-of-both-worlds setting. (2) We introduce the first control of distribution drift that does not rely on boundedness of delays. The control is based on the implicit exploration scheme and adaptive skipping of observations with excessive delays. (3) We introduce a procedure relating standard regret with drifted regret that does not rely on boundedness of delays. At the conceptual level, we demonstrate that complexity of best-of-both-worlds bandits with delayed feedback is characterized by the amount of information missing at the time of decision making (measured by the number of outstanding observations) rather than the time that the information is missing (measured by the delays).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) can be cast as an optimization problem in which the variational parameters are tuned to closely align a variational distribution with the true posterior. The optimization task can be approached through vanilla gradient descent in black-box VI or natural-gradient descent in natural-gradient VI. In this work, we reframe VI as the optimization of an objective that concerns probability distributions defined over a \textit{variational parameter space}. Subsequently, we propose Wasserstein gradient descent for tackling this optimization problem. Notably, the optimization techniques, namely black-box VI and natural-gradient VI, can be reinterpreted as specific instances of the proposed Wasserstein gradient descent. To enhance the efficiency of optimization, we develop practical methods for numerically solving the discrete gradient flows. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through empirical experiments on a synthetic dataset, supplemented by theoretical analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the great capability of Transformers significantly boosts prediction accuracy, it could also yield overconfident predictions and require calibrated uncertainty estimation, which can be commonly tackled by Gaussian processes (GPs). Existing works apply GPs with symmetric kernels under variational inference to the attention kernel; however, omitting the fact that attention kernels are in essence asymmetric. Moreover, the complexity of deriving the GP posteriors remains high for large-scale data. In this work, we propose Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired. Through KEP-SVGP, i) the SVGP pair induced by the two sets of singular vectors from KSVD w.r.t. the attention kernel fully characterizes the asymmetry; ii) using only a small set of adjoint eigenfunctions from KSVD, the derivation of SVGP posteriors can be based on the inversion of a diagonal matrix containing singular values, contributing to a reduction in time complexity; iii) an evidence lower bound is derived so that variational parameters and network weights can be optimized with it. Experiments verify our excellent performances and efficiency on in-distribution, distribution-shift and out-of-distribution benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: Is Mode-Connectedness the Key to Feasible Sample-Based Inference in Bayesian Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in sample-based inference (SBI) for Bayesian neural networks is the size and structure of the networks' parameter space. Our work shows that successful SBI is possible by embracing the characteristic relationship between weight and function space, uncovering a systematic link between overparameterization and the difficulty of the sampling problem. Through extensive experiments, we establish practical guidelines for sampling and convergence diagnosis. As a result, we present a deep ensemble initialized approach as an effective solution with competitive performance and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Variational DAG Estimation via State Augmentation With Stochastic Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the structure of a Bayesian network, in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), from observational data is a statistically and computationally hard problem with essential applications in areas such as causal discovery. Bayesian approaches are a promising direction for solving this task, as they allow for uncertainty quantification and deal with well-known identifiability issues. From a probabilistic inference perspective, the main challenges are (i) representing distributions over graphs that satisfy the DAG constraint and (ii) estimating a posterior over the underlying combinatorial space. We propose an approach that addresses these challenges by formulating a joint distribution on an augmented space of DAGs and permutations. We carry out posterior estimation via variational inference, where we exploit continuous relaxations of discrete distributions. We show that our approach performs competitively when compared with a wide range of Bayesian and non-Bayesian benchmarks on a range of synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Inductive Bias in Transformers: A View From Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inductive bias in Transformers in the infinitely over-parameterized Gaussian process limit and argue transformers tend to be biased towards more permutation symmetric functions in sequence space. We show that the representation theory of the symmetric group can be used to give quantitative analytical predictions when the dataset is symmetric to permutations between tokens. We present a simplified transformer block and solve the model at the limit, including accurate predictions for the learning curves and network outputs. We show that in common setups, one can derive tight bounds in the form of a scaling law for the learnability as a function of the context length. Finally, we argue WikiText dataset, does indeed possess a degree of permutation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Weisfeiler-Leman at the margin: When more expressivity matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm ($1$-WL) is a well-studied heuristic for the graph isomorphism problem. Recently, the algorithm has played a prominent role in understanding the expressive power of message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) and being effective as a graph kernel. Despite its success, $1$-WL faces challenges in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs, leading to the development of more expressive MPNN and kernel architectures. However, the relationship between enhanced expressivity and improved generalization performance remains unclear. Here, we show that an architecture's expressivity offers limited insights into its generalization performance when viewed through graph isomorphism. Moreover, we focus on augmenting $1$-WL and MPNNs with subgraph information and employ classical margin theory to investigate the conditions under which an architecture's increased expressivity aligns with improved generalization performance. In addition, we show that gradient flow pushes the MPNN's weights toward the maximum margin solution. Further, we introduce variations of expressive $1$-WL-based kernel and MPNN architectures with provable generalization properties. Our empirical study confirms the validity of our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Combining Evidence Across Filtrations Using Adjusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In anytime-valid sequential inference, it is known that any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes, which are composite generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any arbitrary stopping time. This paper studies methods for combining e-processes constructed using different information sets (filtrations) for the same null. Although e-processes constructed in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (e.g., by averaging), e-processes constructed in different filtrations cannot, because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to validity in a finer filtration. This issue arises in exchangeability tests, independence tests, and tests for comparing forecasts with lags. We first establish that a class of functions called adjusters allows us to lift e-processes from a coarser filtration into any finer filtration. We then introduce a characterization theorem for adjusters, formalizing a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is an asymptotically logarithmic cost of recovering anytime-validity in the original filtration.</description>

      <title>AdAdaGrad: Adaptive Batch Size Schemes for Adaptive Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The choice of batch sizes in minibatch stochastic gradient optimizers is critical in large-scale model training for both optimization and generalization performance. Although large-batch training is arguably the dominant training paradigm for large-scale deep learning due to hardware advances, the generalization performance of the model deteriorates compared to small-batch training, leading to the so-called "generalization gap" phenomenon. To mitigate this, we investigate adaptive batch size strategies derived from adaptive sampling methods, originally developed only for stochastic gradient descent. Given the significant interplay between learning rates and batch sizes, and considering the prevalence of adaptive gradient methods in deep learning, we emphasize the need for adaptive batch size strategies in these contexts. We introduce AdAdaGrad and its scalar variant AdAdaGradNorm, which progressively increase batch sizes during training, while model updates are performed using AdaGrad and AdaGradNorm. We prove that AdAdaGradNorm converges with high probability at a rate of $\mathscr{O}(1/K)$ to find a first-order stationary point of smooth nonconvex functions within $K$ iterations. AdAdaGrad also demonstrates similar convergence properties when integrated with a novel coordinate-wise variant of our adaptive batch size strategies. We corroborate our theoretical claims by performing image classification experiments, highlighting the merits of the proposed schemes in terms of both training efficiency and model generalization. Our work unveils the potential of adaptive batch size strategies for adaptive gradient optimizers in large-scale model training.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Information Structure in Reinforcement Learning for Partially-Observable Sequential Teams and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a sequential decision-making problem, the information structure is the description of how events in the system occurring at different points in time affect each other. Classical models of reinforcement learning (e.g., MDPs, POMDPs) assume a simple and highly regular information structure, while more general models like predictive state representations do not explicitly model the information structure. By contrast, real-world sequential decision-making problems typically involve a complex and time-varying interdependence of system variables, requiring a rich and flexible representation of information structure. In this paper, we formalize a novel reinforcement learning model which explicitly represents the information structure. We then use this model to carry out an information-structural analysis of the statistical hardness of general sequential decision-making problems, obtaining a characterization via a graph-theoretic quantity of the DAG representation of the information structure. We prove an upper bound on the sample complexity of learning a general sequential decision-making problem in terms of its information structure by exhibiting an algorithm achieving the upper bound. This recovers known tractability results and gives a novel perspective on reinforcement learning in general sequential decision-making problems, providing a systematic way of identifying new tractable classes of problems.</description>

      <title>The Over-Certainty Phenomenon in Modern UDA Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When neural networks are confronted with unfamiliar data that deviate from their training set, this signifies a domain shift. While these networks output predictions on their inputs, they typically fail to account for their level of familiarity with these novel observations. This challenge becomes even more pronounced in resource-constrained settings, such as embedded systems or edge devices. To address such challenges, we aim to recalibrate a neural network's decision boundaries in relation to its cognizance of the data it observes, introducing an approach we coin as certainty distillation. While prevailing works navigate unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with the goal of curtailing model entropy, they unintentionally birth models that grapple with calibration inaccuracies - a dilemma we term the over-certainty phenomenon. In this paper, we probe the drawbacks of this traditional learning model. As a solution to the issue, we propose a UDA algorithm that not only augments accuracy but also assures model calibration, all while maintaining suitability for environments with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Space Hierarchical EBM Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the learning problem of the energy-based prior model and the multi-layer generator model. The multi-layer generator model, which contains multiple layers of latent variables organized in a top-down hierarchical structure, typically assumes the Gaussian prior model. Such a prior model can be limited in modelling expressivity, which results in a gap between the generator posterior and the prior model, known as the prior hole problem. Recent works have explored learning the energy-based (EBM) prior model as a second-stage, complementary model to bridge the gap. However, the EBM defined on a multi-layer latent space can be highly multi-modal, which makes sampling from such marginal EBM prior challenging in practice, resulting in ineffectively learned EBM. To tackle the challenge, we propose to leverage the diffusion probabilistic scheme to mitigate the burden of EBM sampling and thus facilitate EBM learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate a superior performance of our diffusion-learned EBM prior on various challenging tasks.</description>

      <title>Acquiring Better Load Estimates by Combining Anomaly and Change-point Detection in Power Grid Time-series Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present novel methodology for automatic anomaly and switch event filtering to improve load estimation in power grid systems. By leveraging unsupervised methods with supervised optimization, our approach prioritizes interpretability while ensuring robust and generalizable performance on unseen data. Through experimentation, a combination of binary segmentation for change point detection and statistical process control for anomaly detection emerges as the most effective strategy, specifically when ensembled in a novel sequential manner. Results indicate the clear wasted potential when filtering is not applied. The automatic load estimation is also fairly accurate, with approximately 90% of estimates falling within a 10% error margin, with only a single significant failure in both the minimum and maximum load estimates across 60 measurements in the test set. Our methodology's interpretability makes it particularly suitable for critical infrastructure planning, thereby enhancing decision-making processes.</description>
