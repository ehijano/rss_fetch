      <title>An Energy-Efficient RFET-Based Stochastic Computing Neural Network Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) offers significant reductions in hardware complexity for traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but stochastic computing neural networks (SCNNs) still suffer from high resource usage due to components such as stochastic number generators (SNGs) and accumulative parallel counters (APCs), which limit performance. This paper introduces a novel SCNN architecture based on reconfigurable field-effect transistors (RFETs), whose device-level reconfigurability enables the design of highly efficient and compact SNGs, APCs, and other core modules. A dedicated SCNN accelerator architecture is also developed for system-level simulation. Using publicly available open-source standard cell libraries, experimental results show that the proposed RFET-based SCNN accelerator achieves substantial reductions in area, latency, and energy consumption compared to a FinFET-based design at the same technology node.</description>

      <title>AnalogSAGE: Self-evolving Analog Design Multi-Agents with Stratified Memory and Grounded Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog circuit design remains a knowledge- and experience-intensive process that relies heavily on human intuition for topology generation and device parameter tuning. Existing LLM-based approaches typically depend on prompt-driven netlist generation or predefined topology templates, limiting their ability to satisfy complex specification requirements. We propose AnalogSAGE, an open-source self-evolving multi-agent framework that coordinates three-stage agent explorations through four stratified memory layers, enabling iterative refinement with simulation-grounded feedback. To support reproducibility and generality, we release the source code. Our benchmark spans ten specification-driven operational amplifier design problems of varying difficulty, enabling quantitative and cross-task comparison under identical conditions. Evaluated under the open-source SKY130 PDK with ngspice, AnalogSAGE achieves a 10$\times$ overall pass rate, a 48$\times$ Pass@1, and a 4$\times$ reduction in parameter search space compared with existing frameworks, demonstrating that stratified memory and grounded reasoning substantially enhance the reliability and autonomy of analog design automation in practice.</description>

      <title>TYTAN: Taylor-series based Non-Linear Activation Engine for Deep Learning Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in AI architectures and the proliferation of AI-enabled systems have intensified the need for domain-specific architectures that enhance both the acceleration and energy efficiency of AI inference, particularly at the edge. This need arises from the significant resource constraints-such as computational cost and energy consumption-associated with deploying AI algorithms, which involve intensive mathematical operations across multiple layers. High-power-consuming operations, including General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) and activation functions, can be optimized to address these challenges. Optimization strategies for AI at the edge include algorithmic approaches like quantization and pruning, as well as hardware methodologies such as domain-specific accelerators. This paper proposes TYTAN: TaYlor-series based non-linear acTivAtion eNgine, which explores the development of a Generalized Non-linear Approximation Engine (G-NAE). TYTAN targets the acceleration of non-linear activation functions while minimizing power consumption. The TYTAN integrates a re-configurable hardware design with a specialized algorithm that dynamically estimates the necessary approximation for each activation function, aimed at achieving minimal deviation from baseline accuracy. The proposed system is validated through performance evaluations with state-of-the-art AI architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Results from system-level simulations using Silvaco's FreePDK45 process node demonstrate TYTAN's capability to operate at a clock frequency &gt;950 MHz, showcasing its effectiveness in supporting accelerated, energy-efficient AI inference at the edge, which is ~2 times performance improvement, with ~56% power reduction and ~35 times lower area compared to the baseline open-source NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) implementation.</description>

      <title>HLS4PC: A Parametrizable Framework For Accelerating Point-Based 3D Point Cloud Models on FPGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-based 3D point cloud models employ computation and memory intensive mapping functions alongside NN layers for classification/segmentation, and are executed on server-grade GPUs. The sparse, and unstructured nature of 3D point cloud data leads to high memory and computational demand, hindering real-time performance in safety critical applications due to GPU under-utilization. To address this challenge, we present HLS4PC, a parameterizable HLS framework for FPGA acceleration. Our approach leverages FPGA parallelization and algorithmic optimizations to enable efficient fixed-point implementations of both mapping and NN functions. We explore several hardware-aware compression techniques on a state-of-the-art PointMLP-Elite model, including replacing FPS with URS, parameter quantization, layer fusion, and input-points pruning, yielding PointMLP-Lite, a 4x less complex variant with only 2% accuracy drop on ModelNet40. Secondly, we demonstrate that the FPGA acceleration of the PointMLP-Lite results in 3.56x higher throughput than previous works. Furthermore, our implementation achieves 2.3x and 22x higher throughput compared to the GPU and CPU implementations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of signal processing algorithms with constraints on minimal parallelism and memory space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops signal-processing algorithms and implementation schemes under constraints of minimal parallelism and memory space, with the goal of improving energy efficiency of low-power computing hardware. We propose (i) a power/energy consumption model for clocked CMOS logic that supports selecting optimal parallelism, (ii) integer-friendly approximation methods for elementary functions that reduce lookup-table size via constrained piecewise-polynomial (quasi-spline) constructions with accuracy guarantees, (iii) provably conflict-free data placement and execution order for mixed-radix streaming FFT on multi-bank and single-port memories, including a self-sorting FFT variant, and (iv) a parallelism/memory analysis of the fast Schur algorithm for superfast Toeplitz system solving, motivated by echo-cancellation workloads. The results provide constructive theorems, schedules, and design trade-offs enabling efficient specialized accelerators.</description>

      <title>KernelEvolve: Scaling Agentic Kernel Coding for Heterogeneous AI Accelerators at Meta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.</description>

      <title>A Runtime-Adaptive Transformer Neural Network Accelerator on FPGAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18148v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) excel in natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV) without relying on recurrent or convolutional layers. However, they have high computational and memory demands, particularly on resource-constrained devices like FPGAs. Moreover, transformer models vary in processing time across applications, requiring custom models with specific parameters. Designing custom accelerators for each model is complex and time-intensive. Some custom accelerators exist with no runtime adaptability, and they often rely on sparse matrices to reduce latency. However, hardware designs become more challenging due to the need for application-specific sparsity patterns. This paper introduces ADAPTOR, a runtime-adaptive accelerator for dense matrix computations in transformer encoders and decoders on FPGAs. ADAPTOR enhances the utilization of processing elements and on-chip memory, enhancing parallelism and reducing latency. It incorporates efficient matrix tiling to distribute resources across FPGA platforms and is fully quantized for computational efficiency and portability. Evaluations on Xilinx Alveo U55C data center cards and embedded platforms like VC707 and ZCU102 show that our design is 1.2$\times$ and 2.87$\times$ more power efficient than the NVIDIA K80 GPU and the i7-8700K CPU respectively. Additionally, it achieves a speedup of 1.7 to 2.25$\times$ compared to some state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators.</description>

      <title>NVM-in-Cache: Repurposing Commodity 6T SRAM Cache into NVM Analog Processing-in-Memory Engine using a Novel Compute-on-Powerline Scheme</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep neural network (DNN) workloads has significantly increased the demand for large-capacity on-chip SRAM in machine learning (ML) applications, with SRAM arrays now occupying a substantial fraction of the total die area. To address the dual challenges of storage density and computation efficiency, this paper proposes an NVM-in-Cache architecture that integrates resistive RAM (RRAM) devices into a conventional 6T-SRAM cell, forming a compact 6T-2R bit-cell. This hybrid cell enables Processing-in-Memory (PIM) mode, which performs massively parallel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations directly on cache power lines while preserving stored cache data. By exploiting the intrinsic properties of the 6T-2R structure, the architecture achieves additional storage capability, high computational throughput without any bit-cell area overhead. Circuit- and array-level simulations in GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a throughput of 0.4 TOPS and 452.34 TOPS/W. For 128 row-parallel operations, the CIFAR-10 classification is demonstrated by mapping a Resnet-18 neural network, achieving an accuracy of 91.76%. These results highlight the potential of the NVM-in-Cache approach to serve as a scalable, energy-efficient computing method by re-purposing existing 6T SRAM cache architecture for next-generation AI accelerators and general purpose processors.</description>

      <title>ODMA: On-Demand Memory Allocation Framework for LLM Serving on LPDDR-Class Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-memory management is a key bottleneck for serving large language models (LLMs) on accelerators whose memory has poor small-granularity random-access bandwidth (e.g., LPDDR5-class). Existing approaches either statically pre-allocate worst-case KV-cache per request, wasting substantial device memory, or rely on fine-grained paging that assumes high random-access tolerance and is therefore ill-suited to LPDDR-style systems. We present ODMA, an on-demand memory allocation framework for LLM serving on random-access-constrained device memory (RACM) platforms such as LPDDR5-based Cambricon MLUs. ODMA builds on generation-length prediction while addressing distribution drift and heavy-tailed request lengths via dynamic bucket partitioning and a large-bucket safeguard: bucket boundaries are periodically re-learned from online histograms, and high-uncertainty or overflowed requests fall back to a reserved large bucket for robustness. On Alpaca and Google-NQ, ODMA improves S3's predictor accuracy from 98.60% to 99.55% and from 82.68% to 93.36%, respectively. Serving DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on four Cambricon MLU370-X4 accelerators, ODMA increases device-memory utilization from 55.05% to 72.45% on Alpaca and from 42.54% to 61.79% on Google-NQ, and boosts throughput by 23% and 27% over a static pre-allocation baseline. These results show that predictor-driven, hardware-aware allocation can unlock efficient LLM serving on RACM accelerators without hardware changes, complementing paging-centric designs tailored to HBM systems.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence Theory of Pipeline Gradient-based Analog In-memory Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aiming to accelerate the training of large deep neural networks (DNN) in an energy-efficient way, analog in-memory computing (AIMC) emerges as a solution with immense potential. AIMC accelerator keeps model weights in memory without moving them from memory to processors during training, reducing overhead dramatically. Despite its efficiency, scaling up AIMC systems presents significant challenges. Since weight copying is expensive and inaccurate, data parallelism is less efficient on AIMC accelerators. It necessitates the exploration of pipeline parallelism, particularly asynchronous pipeline parallelism, which utilizes all available accelerators during the training process. This paper examines the convergence theory of stochastic gradient descent on AIMC hardware with an asynchronous pipeline (Analog-SGD-AP). Although there is empirical exploration of AIMC accelerators, the theoretical understanding of how analog hardware imperfections in weight updates affect the training of multi-layer DNN models remains underexplored. Furthermore, the asynchronous pipeline parallelism results in stale weights issues, which render the update signals no longer valid gradients. To close the gap, this paper investigates the convergence properties of Analog-SGD-AP on multi-layer DNN training. We show that the Analog-SGD-AP converges with iteration complexity $O(\varepsilon^{-2}+\varepsilon^{-1})$ despite the aforementioned issues, which matches the complexities of digital SGD and Analog SGD with synchronous pipeline, except the non-dominant term $O(\varepsilon^{-1})$. It implies that AIMC training benefits from asynchronous pipelining almost for free compared with the synchronous pipeline by overlapping computation.</description>
