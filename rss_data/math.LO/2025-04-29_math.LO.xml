      <title>Lukasiewicz unification with finitely many variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the correspondence between finitely axiomatised theories in {\L}ukasieiwcz logic and rational polyhedra, we prove that the unification type of the fragment of {\L}ukasiewicz logic with $n\geq 2$ variables is nullary. This solves a problem left open in [V. Marra and L. Spada. Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 164 2013, p. 192-210]. Furthermore, we refine the study of unification with bounds on the number of variables. Our proposal distinguishes the number $m$ of variables allowed in the problem and the number $n$ in the solution. We prove that the unification type of {\L}ukasiewicz logic for all $m,n \geq 2$ is nullary.</description>

      <title>Y is a least fixed point combinator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of recursive functions is related in a well-known way to the notion of *least fixed points*, by endowing a set of partial functions with an ordering in terms of their domain of definition. When terms in the pure lambda-calculus are considered as partial functions on the set of reduced lambda-terms, they inherit such a partial order. We prove that Curry's well-known fixed point combinator Y produces least fixed points with respect to this partial order.</description>

      <title>Semi-abelian by Design: Johnstone Algebras Unifying Implication and Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Johnstone demonstrated that Heyting semilattices form a semi-abelian category via a specific triple of terms. Inspired by this work, we introduce \emph{Johnstone algebras} or J-algebras. The algebraic $(*,\to,e)$-theory $J$ of arities $(2,2,0)$ consists of three axioms carefully chosen to ensure protomodularity in alignment with Johnstone's terms. Johnstone algebras generalize well-known structures such as groups (division) and Heyting semilattices (implication) providing a unified framework within the well-behaved setting of semi-abelian categories.
  We present two primary contributions. First, we identify the M-axiom, \[ (t(x,y)\to x)\to (t(x,y)\to z) \approx x\to z, \text{ where }t(x,y) = (x\to y)\to y. \] The M-axiom is satisfied by residuated Johnstone algebras, and it can be considered a weakening of the H-axiom to comparable elements. We show that $t(x,y)$ defines a \emph{relative closure term} in MBC-algebras, and it implies that MBC-algebras form a variety of algebras, thereby generalizing the corresponding theorem related to HBCK-algebras. Second, we prove several no-go results, demonstrating that balanced theories or theories admitting non-discrete monotone or inflationary algebras cannot possess Malcev terms.
  Together, these results establish Johnstone algebras as significant structures that achieve desirable categorical properties by carefully integrating both logical and symmetric features, while closely avoiding the constraints imposed by our no-go results.</description>

      <title>On a cofinal Reinhardt embedding without Powerset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a positive answer to a question by Matthews whether $\mathsf{ZF}^-$ is consistent with a non-trivial cofinal Reinhardt elementary embedding $j\colon V\to V$. The consistency follows from $\mathsf{ZFC} + I_0$, and more precisely, it is witnessed by Schlutzenberg's model of $\mathsf{ZF}$ with an elementary embedding $k\colon V_{\lambda+2}\to V_{\lambda+2}$.</description>

      <title>On definable J-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study definable J-sets for definable groups and compare them with weakly generic sets. We show that the property that J-sets coincide with weakly generic sets is invariant on enough saturated models, and hence a model-theoretical property. We have positive results for superstable commutative groups and some easy examples in pCF. We also give an example for noncoincidence.</description>

      <title>Duality Theory for Bounded Lattices: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are numerous generalizations of the celebrated Priestley duality for bounded distributive lattices to the non-distributive setting. The resulting dualities rely on an earlier foundational work of such authors as Nachbin, Birkhoff-Frink, Bruns-Lakser, Hofmann-Mislove-Stralka, and others. We undertake a detailed comparative study of the existing dualities for arbitrary bounded (non-distributive) lattices, including supplying the dual description of bounded lattice homomorphisms where it was lacking. This is achieved by working with relations instead of functions. As a result, we arrive at a landscape of categories that provide various generalizations of the category of Priestley spaces. We provide explicit descriptions of the functors yielding equivalences of these categories, together with explicit equivalences with the category of bounded lattices and bounded lattice homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>On an Inferential Semantics for Intuitionistic Sentential Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sandqvist's base-extension semantics (B-eS) for intuitionistic sentential logic grounds meaning relative to bases (rather than, say, models), which are arbitrary sets of permitted inferences over sentences. While his soundness proof is standard, his completeness proof, is quite unusual. It closely parallels a method introduced much earlier by Mints, who developed a resolution-based approach to intuitionistic logic using a systematic translation of formulas into sentential counterparts. In this short note, we highlight the connection between these two approaches and show that the soundness and completeness of B-eS follow directly from Mints' theorem. While the result is modest, it reinforces the relevance of proof-search to proof-theoretic semantics and suggests that resolution methods have a deeper conceptual role in constructive reasoning than is often acknowledged.</description>

      <title>Measurability in the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to explicitly extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. As the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning underpins a wide range of further theoretical developments, our results are of foundational importance: A careful analysis of measurability aspects is essential, especially when the theorem is used in settings where measure-theoretic subtleties play a role. We particularly discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals. This class of hypothesis spaces covers all artificial neural networks for binary classification that use commonly employed activation functions like ReLU and the sigmoid function.</description>

      <title>Semantic Foundations of Reductive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of logic has largely been through the 'deductive' paradigm: conclusions are inferred from established premisses. However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</description>
