      <title>Implications for Pulsar Timing Arrays of Sub-solar Black Hole Detections: From LVK to Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of compact binary mergers with sub-solar masses at gravitational-wave observatories could mark the groundbreaking discovery of primordial black holes (PBHs). Concurrently, evidence for a nHz stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could suggest a non-astrophysical origin, potentially arising from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). In this work, we analyze the connection between the two phenomena in the case where they share a common origin: the collapse of large primordial curvature perturbations in the early universe. We focus on sub-solar PBH populations within reach of upcoming experiments, including the current and future runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA as well as the third generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Using a Bayesian framework with physically motivated priors, we perform a consistent model comparison that incorporates existing astrophysical bounds together with the discovery potential of future detectors. Our analysis lends stronger support for the SIGW interpretation over the astrophysical one, as the narrowed priors place greater weight on the region of highest likelihood. Ultimately, we illustrate that combining PTA data with interferometer searches can deliver correlated evidence for new physics across multiple gravitational-wave bands.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation and turbulent reacceleration set by high-frequency observations of the radio halo in the Coma cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of the recent observation of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster at 6.6 GHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope on models based on turbulent reacceleration of electrons produced in dark matter annihilation processes. Observing at that frequency it is possible to obtain information on the electrons spectrum at energies where the effect of turbulent reacceleration becomes sub-dominant with respect to energy losses, and therefore to obtain information on the properties of seed electrons. Under the assumption that dark matter particles are neutralino-like particles annihilating at a rate close to the maximum allowed by Fermi-LAT upper limits in dwarf galaxies, we obtain some constraints on the intensity of the reacceleration and on the value of the neutralino mass. In particular, models with mass of the order of 10 GeV are generally disfavored, because they produce a high-frequency radio spectrum that can not reproduce the possible flattening observed between 5 and 6.6 GHz; on the other hand, models with mass of the order of 500 GeV, in order to reproduce the observed spectrum at frequencies below 100 MHz, require a reacceleration phase longer than $10^9$ yr, which would require more than one event responsible of the generation of turbulence in the cluster. The resulting optimal mass values are in the range 100--200 GeV, with a preference for the quark annihilation channel.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Cosmological Constant from Stellar Orbits Around Sgr A* Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel analytical framework employing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to constrain the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ through the analysis of stellar orbits around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A* at the Galactic center. Focusing on the well-observed S2 star, we use an inverse PINN (iPINN) architecture to infer orbital elements and estimate the total precession angle from astrometric data. By isolating the contribution from $\Lambda$, which is defined as the difference between the total precession and the Schwarzschild precession, we derive a stringent upper bound of $\Lambda \leq 5.67 \times 10^{-40}, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$, which is approximately two orders of magnitude tighter than previous estimates obtained using similar data-driven methods. Extension of our analysis to two additional long-period S-stars, S1 and S9, reveals that while the cosmological precession becomes relatively more prominent in such systems, limited orbital coverage introduces significant uncertainties in parameter estimation. Among the cases examined, the constraint derived from S2 remains the most robust. Our results highlight the potential of PINN-based approaches for extracting physical insights from sparse or noisy astronomical data. Future applications to next-generation observational data and further methodological improvements in machine learning are expected to refine the cosmological constraints and enable broader tests of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Probe the missing baryons in cosmic filaments with Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic filaments are thought to host a substantial fraction of the missing baryons at redshifts $z&lt;2$. In this study, we probe the baryonic content of these filaments using localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Filaments are identified from the galaxy distribution in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys using the DisPerSe algorithm. We find tentative evidence ($\sim 3 \sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the relationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic filaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the filamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\beta$-model gas profile with $\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity of $\delta = 20.78$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and observational results. The inferred baryon fraction residing in filaments decreases with redshift, from approximately $0.25-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.02$ to $0.15-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.5$, and $0.03-0.04\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.8$. These estimates are likely lower bounds, particularly at $z&gt;0.5$, due to the limited number of identified filaments and localized FRBs at higher redshifts. We also examine various factors that may affect the statistical significance of our results. Our method offers an independent approach to tracing baryons in cosmic filaments and underscores the importance of expanding localized FRB samples and deepening galaxy surveys, which are key steps toward refining these estimates and addressing the missing baryon problem.</description>

      <title>Constraining Ricci-Cubic Holographic Dark Energy from observational data using the MCMC sampling and enhanced Machine learning analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we find constraints on the parameter space of the Ricci-Cubic Holographic dark energy (RCHDE) from various observational data sets like Hubble data, cosmic-chronometer data, Baryon-acoustic oscillation data, and also data from gamma-ray bursts. RCHDE is formed from the cubic invariant, which in turn is built from the cubic contractions of the Riemann and Ricci tensors. We have used the Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique to find constraints on the model parameters via Bayesian inference. Contour plots have been obtained for the model parameters, showing their marginalized and joint probability distributions. The best-fit regression lines are found for the constrained model and compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model to verify and validate the model. To complement this data analysis mechanism, we have also performed an enhanced machine learning analysis using observational Hubble parameter data. This approach serves to validate the model's predictive power through independent, data-driven regression techniques. Different graphical illustrations of the machine learning techniques have been presented to understand the results. These illustrations reveal a strong agreement between the Hubble parameter predictions from the machine learning models, the theoretical RCHDE model, and observational data.</description>

      <title>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances to NGC 1316, NGC 1380, NGC 1404, &amp; NGC 4457: A Pilot Study of a Parallel Distance Ladder Using Type Ia Supernovae in Early-Type Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are found in all types of galaxies, recent local Hubble constant measurements have disfavored using SNe Ia in early-type or quiescent galaxies, aiming instead for better consistency with SNe Ia in star-forming, late-type host galaxies calibrated by Cepheid distances. Here we investigate the feasibility of a parallel distance ladder using SNe Ia exclusively in quiescent, massive ($\log M_*/M_{\odot} \geq 10$) host galaxies, calibrated by tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances. We present TRGB measurements to four galaxies: three measured from the Hubble Space Telescope with the ACS F814W filter, and one measured from the JWST NIRCam F090W filter. Combined with literature measurements, we define a TRGB calibrator sample of five high-mass, early-type galaxies that hosted well-measured SNe Ia: NGC 1316 (SN 2006dd), NGC 1380 (SN 1992A), NGC 1404 (SN 2007on, SN 2011iv), NGC 4457 (SN 2020nvb), and NGC 4636 (SN 2020ue). We jointly standardize these calibrators with a fiducial sample of 124 Hubble-flow SNe Ia from the Zwicky Transient Facility that are matched in host-galaxy and light-curve properties. Our results with this homogenized subsample show a Hubble residual scatter of under 0.11 mag, lower than usually observed in cosmological samples of the full SN~Ia distribution. We obtain a measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 75.3 \pm 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, including statistical and estimated systematic uncertainties, and discuss the potential to further improve the precision of this approach. As calibrator and supernova samples grow, we advocate that future cosmological applications of SNe Ia use subsamples matched in host-galaxy and supernova properties across redshift.</description>

      <title>Strong Lens Discoveries in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR10 with Two Deep Learning Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10 (DR10). This paper is the fourth in a series of searches (following Huang et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2021; Storfer et al. 2024, Paper I, II, &amp; III respectively). This is the first catalog of lens candidates covering nearly the entirety of the extragalactic sky south of declination $\delta\approx +32$ deg, all of it observed by the DECam, covering $\sim$14,000 $deg^2$. We impose a $z$-band magnitude cut of &lt; 20 in AB magnitude. We deploy a Residual Neural Network and EfficientNet as an ensemble trained on a compilation of known lensing systems and high-grade candidates as well as nonlenses in the same footprint. The predictions from these two base models are aggregated using a meta-learner. After applying our ensemble to the survey data, we exclude known candidates and systems, and use our own visual inspection portal to rank images in the top 0.01 percentile of all neural network recommendations. We have found 811 new lens candidates. These include 484 new candidates in the Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint, all parts of which have been searched for strong lenses at least once before, either by our group or others. Combining the discoveries from this work with those from Paper I (335), II (1210), and III (1512), we have discovered a total of 3868 new candidates in the DESI Legacy Surveys.</description>

      <title>Identification of Strongly Lensed Gravitational Wave Events Using Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of third-generation gravitational wave detectors, the identification of strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) events is expected to play an increasingly vital role in cosmology and fundamental physics. However, traditional Bayesian inference methods suffer from combinatorial computational overhead as the number of events grows, making real-time analysis infeasible. To address this, we propose a deep learning model named Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer (SEMD), based on Vision Transformers, which classifies strongly lensed GW events by modeling morphological similarity between time-frequency spectrogram pairs. By integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons , SEMD achieves strong feature extraction and discrimination. Trained and evaluated on simulated datasets using Advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope noise, the model demonstrates robustness and generalization across different detector sensitivities and physical conditions, highlighting the promise of deep learning for rapid identification of strongly lensed GW signals.</description>

      <title>Observational bounds on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars from Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent gravitational-wave (GW) observations offer a unique opportunity to probe the fundamental nature of compact objects. A growing body of research has focused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of DM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly alter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal deformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during binary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that, for the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using real GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115, and GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\chi}$, and particle mass, $m_{\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a scalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on $F_{\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating that different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in different ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM halo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105 and GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding strong upper bounds on $F_{\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale $m_{\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to probing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations.</description>

      <title>A Linearly Polarized Merger Shock Down to 550 MHz: A uGMRT Study of the Merging Cluster Abell 746</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio relics, arc-like polarized sources with highly aligned magnetic fields, are typically found on the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. The magneto-ionic media responsible for the significant coherence observed in radio relics remain poorly understood. Low-frequency measurements of radio relics are essential for constraining depolarization models, which provide crucial insights into the magnetic field distribution. However, these measurements are challenging due to the emission properties and interferometer systematics. We have detected polarization signals from the northwest radio relic in Abell 746 at 650 MHz with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, marking the first-ever detection of polarisation from radio relics below 1 GHz. At this frequency, the average Rotation Measure (RM) corrected magnetic fields align well with shock radio emission, typical of radio relics. The fractional polarization at 650 MHz is $\sim 18\pm4 \%$. Our results indicate that a single internal depolarization model cannot explain the observed depolarization spectra, suggesting a non-uniform magnetic field distribution or complex contribution of different polarized regions in the radio relic. Our detection of polarization signals at 650 MHz reveals critical insights into radio relic magnetic field structures, offering a low-frequency approach to understanding ICM magnetic fields in merging galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Microlensing of the Galactic Centre $\gamma$-Ray Excess: A New Test for Point-Like or Extended Emission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a potential test of the origin of the $\gamma$-ray Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass objects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between the possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from more prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an astrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small, currently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother emission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of gravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass lenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the size of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in the emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\gamma$-ray emission from dark matter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we find that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly greater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\gamma$-ray detectors. For a small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude increase in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events remaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would occur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a four-order-of-magnitude improvement. Whilst microlensing might not be a definitive test of the origin of the GCE, in future observations, it may prove useful in determining the properties of any point-like source population.</description>

Abstract: We investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the framework of spatially covariant gravity (SCG), a broad class of Lorentz-violating modified gravity theories respecting only spatial diffeomorphism invariance. Extending earlier SCG formulations, we compute the general kernel function for SIGWs on a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background, focusing on polynomial-type SCG Lagrangians up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the total number of derivatives in each monomial. We derive explicit expressions for the kernel in the case of power-law time evolution of the coefficients, and restrict attention to the subset of SCG operators whose tensor modes propagate at the speed of light, thereby avoiding late-time divergences in the fractional energy density of SIGWs. Instead of the usual Newtonian gauge, the breaking of time reparametrization symmetry in SCG necessitates a unitary gauge analysis. We compute the energy density of SIGWs for representative parameter combinations, finding distinctive deviations from general relativity (GR), including scale-dependent modifications to both the amplitude and the spectral shape. Our results highlight the potential of stochastic GW background measurements to probe spatially covariant gravity and other Lorentz-violating extensions of GR.</description>

      <title>Probing Evolution of Long Gamma-Ray Burst Properties through Their Cosmic Formation History</title>

Abstract: The astrophysics of Long GRB (LGRB) progenitors as well as possible cosmological evolution in their properties still poses many open questions. Previous studies suggest that the LGRB rate density (LGRB-RD) follows the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) only at high-z and attribute this to the metallicity evolution of progenitor stars. For low z, opinions differ on whether the uptick in the LGRB RD is due to a distinct class of low-luminosity GRBs or perhaps even a different progenitor subclass. To investigate these questions, we utilize data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based observatories (redshift). To test the hypothesis that the observations can be mapped (with/without evolution) to the well-established cosmic SFRD, we consider three cases: no evolution, beaming angle evolution, and a simple power-law evolution. The comparison shows that the 'no evolution' case can be ruled out. Our study highlights that the beaming angle evolution or the simple power law evolution are also not sufficient to obtain a good match between the LGRB-RD and SFRD. Rather, the inclusion of multiple evolving properties of LGRBs in combination appears to be required to match the two rate densities in their entirety.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos are believed to be the most abundant fermions in the Universe, but their masses are unknown, except for being non-zero but much smaller than other fermions. Cosmological relic neutrinos could also have non-zero chemical potentials (or asymmetries). Using neutrino-involved N-body simulations, we investigate the neutrino effects on the matter pairwise velocity, which itself is an interesting probe of cosmology. We find that for light-halo ($[10^{11},10^{13}]\ M_\odot$) mean pairwise velocity, in the transition range ($[4,15]\ \mathrm{Mpc}$), the effects of neutrino masses overwhelm the effects of neutrino asymmetries, while in the two-halo-group range ($[25,50]\ \mathrm{Mpc}$), for both light and heavy haloes ($[10^{13},10^{15}]\ M_\odot$), the effects of neutrino asymmetries dominate, making it possible to disentangle the two effects. We provide fitting formulae to quantify the effects of neutrino mass and asymmetry on halo-halo pairwise velocities.</description>

      <title>Excess Radiation from Axion-Photon Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two notable anomalies in radio observations -- the excess radiation in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cosmic microwave background, revealed by ARCADE2, and the twice-deeper absorption trough of the global 21cm line, identified by EDGES -- remain unresolved. These phenomena may have a shared origin, as the enhancement of the 21cm absorption trough could arise from excess heating. We investigate this scenario through the framework of axion-like particles (ALPs), showing that the resonant conversion of ALPs into photons can produce a photon abundance sufficient to resolve both anomalies simultaneously. Our model naturally explains the observed radio excess between 0.4 and 10GHz while also enhances the 21cm absorption feature at 78MHz. Furthermore, it predicts a novel power-law scaling of the radio spectrum above 0.5GHz and an additional absorption trough below 30MHz, which could be verified through cross-detection in upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Missing Components in {\Lambda}CDM from DESI Y1 BAO Measurements: Insights from Redshift Remapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore transformations of the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric and cosmological parameters that align with observational data, aiming to gain insights into potential extensions of standard cosmological models.
  We modify the FLRW metric by introducing a scaling factor, $e^{2\Theta(a)}$ (the cosmological scaling function, CSF), which alters the standard relationship between cosmological redshift and the cosmic scale factor without affecting angular measurements or Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Using data from DESI Year 1, Pantheon+ supernovae, and the Planck CMB temperature power spectrum, we constrain both the CSF and cosmological parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach.
  Our results indicate that the CSF model fits observational data with a lower Hubble constant (although it is compatible with the value given by Planck 2018 within 1$\sigma$) and is predominantly dark-matter-dominated. Additionally, the CSF model produces temperature and lensing power spectra similar to those predicted by the standard model, though with lower values in the CSF model at large scales. We have also checked that when fitting a CSF model without dark energy to the data, we obtain a more negative conformal function. This suggests that the CSF model may offer hints about missing elements and opens up a new avenue for exploring physical interpretations of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Scalar Field Dominated Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical code that solves the Misner-Sharp system for a spherically symmetric cosmological model containing both a scalar field and a perfect fluid. While the code is capable of exploring general scenarios involving an minimally coupled scalar field and perfect fluid, we focus on the regime where the scalar field dominates the dynamics, particularly in the post-inflationary scalar field-dominated scenario, where the universe is governed by a rapidly oscillating scalar field for a period lasting a few $e$-folds. We analyse the threshold for PBH formation under quadratic and quartic potentials, evolving configurations from superhorizon scales. Our results confirm that a quartic potential behavior is similar to the radiation-dominated universe, resulting in a PBH formation threshold close to the well-established value in radiation backgrounds. Conversely, in the quadratic case, we observe a significant deviation from the expected dust-like behaviour, due to wave-like effects opposing the gravitational collapse. While numerical limitations prevent us from evolving a wide range of initial conditions to determine a precise threshold for PBH formation, our findings suggest that PBH formation may be suppressed with respect to the pure dust scenario, allowing the formation of stable solitonic structures instead. This study highlights the importance of properly accounting for wave dynamics in oscillating scalar fields when characterising PBH formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over several dedicated programs that include targets beyond the main cosmological samples, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collected spectra for 304,970 unique objects in two fields centered on the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. In this work, we develop spectroscopic redshift robustness criteria for those spectra, validate these criteria using visual inspection, and provide two custom Value-Added Catalogs with our redshift characterizations. With these criteria, we reliably classify 212,935 galaxies below z &lt; 1.6, 9,713 quasars and 35,222 stars. As a critical element in characterizing the selection function, we provide the description of 70 different algorithms that were used to select these targets from imaging data. To facilitate joint imaging/spectroscopic analyses, we provide row-matched photometry from the Dark Energy Camera, Hyper-Suprime Cam, and public COSMOS2020 photometric catalogs. Finally, we demonstrate example applications of these large catalogs to photometric redshift estimation, cluster finding, and completeness studies.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Origin of Primordial Black Holes: A Viable Dark Matter Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are compelling candidates for explaining the present-day relic abundance of cold dark matter (CDM), yet their formation typically requires finely tuned early-universe dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel PBH formation mechanism within a well-established magnetogenesis framework. This scenario simultaneously accounts for the large-scale magnetic fields observed today and generates an enhanced curvature power spectrum at intermediate scales, leading to PBH formation with masses that can survive until the present epoch. We identify a narrow reheating temperature range, $10^5\,\mathrm{GeV} \leq T_{re} \leq 3\times 10^5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, within which the resulting PBHs can constitute the entirety of the observed CDM abundance. Furthermore, our model predicts a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background as a byproduct of the PBH formation process. Remarkably, the predicted GW signal lies within the sensitivity reach of upcoming space-based interferometers, such as the LISA, DECIGO, or SKA mission, offering a direct observational probe of this PBH generation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Measuring black hole spin through gravitational lensing of pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new procedure for measuring the spin of a black hole with an unprecedented accuracy based on the gravitational lensing of millisecond pulsars. We derive the basic equations for lensing by a rotating black hole. We show that the frame dragging effect increases the deflection angle of a light ray co-rotating with the black hole. For the primary (secondary) images the angular positions are larger (smaller) for a rotating black hole by an amount on the order of tens of microarcseconds. The differential time delay of images for the case in which the lens is a rotating black hole is smaller than that in the case of non-rotating lens of the same mass, and it can be larger than a few milliseconds. We show that this quantity offers the possibility of reducing the error of spin measurement to less than one percent if we could measure the differential time delay with accuracy of microseconds. We also study relativistic images that are produced by light rays that rotate around the black hole before reaching the observer. The angular positions of relativistic images on the same side as the primary (secondary) image are a few microarcseconds larger (smaller) if the black hole is rotating. Furthermore, the differential time delay between relativistic images is about twelve orders of magnitude larger in the case of rotating lens.</description>

      <title>Refitting cosmological data with neutrino mass and degeneracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple and natural extension of the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is to allow relic neutrinos to have finite chemical potentials. We confront this $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model, a $\Lambda$CDM with neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and degeneracy $\xi_3$ as additional parameters, with various cosmological data sets. We find that the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions become significant only in the presence of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization data. Specifically, the global and local measurements agree to within 0.8$\sigma$ and 1.6$\sigma$ for the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, respectively, when the CMB polarization data are not included. Therefore, the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions exist between CMB temperature and polarization data, both being global measurements. Fitting the $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model to the CMB temperature data, we find 3$\sigma$ evidence for nonzero neutrino mass ($M_\nu=0.57^{+0.17}_{-0.13}\,\mathrm{eV}$) and degeneracy ($\xi_3=1.13^{+0.41}_{-0.19}$), and the O(1) neutrino degeneracy parameter is compatible with Big Bang nucleosynthesis data. The scalar index $n_s$ exceeds 1 slightly, which is compatible with some hybrid inflation models. Furthermore, the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data prefer the $\Lambda$CDM$\xi$ model to the Planck $\Lambda$CDM model. Similar results are obtained when including additional supernova data, while the inclusion of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope $\tau$ prior shifts the preferred $M_\nu$ and $\xi_3$ values closer to zero and brings $n_s$ back to the values favored when the polarization data are included.</description>

      <title>Running Einstein Constant and a Possible Vacuum State of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a revised formulation of General Relativity for cosmological settings, in which the Einstein constant varies with the energy density of the Universe. We demonstrate that this modification has only phenomenological impact of providing an effective dark energy density expression. Assuming a state close to vacuum, here defined by the vanishing product of the Einstein coupling constant and the Universe's energy density, we perform a Taylor expansion of the theory and hence extend it to the whole domain. In this framework, the (renormalized) vacuum energy problem is studied, and an additional constant pressure term, which induces a Chaplygin-like contribution to the dark energy sector, arises in the late-time dynamics. The correction to the late-time Hubble parameter is investigated by comparing theoretical predictions with the late Universe observational data. Our findings indicate that the current value of the stated vacuum energy is consistent with zero within 1$\sigma$. Implications of the modified $\Lambda$CDM model with respect to the Hubble tension are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in cosmological simulations: growth prospects for supermassive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions and experience significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of $f_{\rm PBH}$ = $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M$_\odot$, as inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-3}$, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow to $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=20$. These intermediate black holes (IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such as GNZ-11 ($10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=10$), outperforming light seed black hole (BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding prescriptions. On the other hand, $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-4}$ resulted in no significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH seeds is sensitive to the true value of $f_{\rm PBH}$ in the Universe, and showing that the $f_{\rm PBH} =10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ boundary marks the threshold above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M$_\odot$ PBHs becomes effective. This is the first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on inflationary models with non-minimally derivative coupling by ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most recent data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) reveals a larger value of the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, ruling out a broad class of inflationary attractors. In this paper, we consider inflationary models including the power law potential, the hilltop model, the polynomial $\alpha$-attractor and exponential $\alpha-$attractor, with non-minimally derivative coupling in the high friction limit, and show how the models can fit ACT data. We also derive constraints on the model parameters using the latest ACT data.</description>

      <title>XRISM Reveals Complex Multi-Temperature Structures in the Abell 2029 Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present $\sim$500 ks XRISM observations covering the central and two northern regions of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. Resolve enables us to distinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron (Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029 using line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized equilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61 keV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions, respectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate thermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions. Significant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and inner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation and ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central region, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4 keV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely consistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However, Resolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region and $\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with displaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a 2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant development in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler gas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already cooled to its present temperature. If this temperature structure is stable and no heating mechanism is present, this reservoir is likely to cool to even lower temperatures and form stars.</description>

      <title>Second public data release of the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the second data release (DR2) of the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation, from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, available at http://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/fire. DR2 includes all snapshots for most simulations, starting at z ~ 99, with all snapshot time spacings &lt;~ 25 Myr. The Core suite -- comprising 14 Milky Way-mass galaxies, 5 SMC/LMC-mass galaxies, and 4 lower-mass galaxies -- includes 601 snapshots to z = 0. For the Core suite, we also release resimulations with physics variations: (1) dark-matter-only versions; (2) a modified ultraviolet background with later reionization at z = 7.8; (3) magnetohydrodynamics, anisotropic conduction, and viscosity in gas; and (4) a model for cosmic-ray injection, transport, and feedback (assuming a constant diffusion coefficient). The Massive Halo suite now includes 8 massive galaxies with 278 snapshots to z = 1. The High Redshift suite includes 34 simulations: in addition to the 22 simulations run to z = 5, we now include 12 additional simulations run to z = 7 and z = 9. We also release 4 dark-matter-only cosmological boxes used to generate zoom-in initial conditions for many FIRE simulations. Most simulations include catalogs of (sub)halos and galaxies at all available snapshots, and most Core simulations to z = 0 include full halo merger trees.</description>
