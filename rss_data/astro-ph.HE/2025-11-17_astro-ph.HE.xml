      <title>Spectropolarimetric Evolution Reveals Dual-Axis Ejecta in the Atypical Magnetar-Powered SN 2012au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present six epochs of optical spectropolarimetric observations of the unique and slow-evolving Type Ib supernova (SN) 2012au, between 0 and 295 days post R-band maximum. The polarization levels seen throughout our observations are on average 0.87% +/- 0.05% higher than those of any Type Ib SN~yet studied, suggesting either that it is the most asymmetric of the sample, or if all SNe Ib have similar asymmetry, that it is viewed at a more optimum angle. Significant continuum polarization indicates that the photosphere exhibited a global departure from spherical symmetry at the level of 10%-40% at the earliest times (days 0--40), which decreased to 0%-20% by days 57--90. During the early photospheric phase, the ejecta maintained a near-constant orientation of 12{\deg}-20{\deg} on the sky, as shown by the dominant axis in the Stokes q-u plane. Polarization signatures in the Fe II {\lambda}{\lambda}{\lambda}4924, 5018, 5169 lines shared this axis. Meanwhile, high levels of polarization associated with the He I lines traced distinct q-u loops with a dramatic rotation away from the dominant axis, indicating that the early-time ejecta were also characterized by hot, fast, helium-rich material concentrated near the poles. At day 295, during the transition to the nebular phase, a new, highly elongated structure became prominent in the ejecta, with an axis orthogonal to the dominant axis that defined the photospheric phase. This dual-axis geometry may link SN 2012au's high luminosity and asymmetric structure to a magnetar powering mechanism.</description>

      <title>Widening of Binaries via Non-conservative Mass Transfer as a Formation Channel for Gaia Black Hole System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detected Gaia systems hosting compact objects challenge standard models of binary star evolution. In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, it is expected that they underwent a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal mass ratios, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to either a stellar merger or a final binary with a very short orbital period. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. With the aid of detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether fully non-conservative mass transfer, where mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two of the Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from the standard isotropic re-emission model, which assumes mass loss from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss model, without the need for fine-tuning, reproduces the observed orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well across a wide range of initial conditions. This scenario, therefore, offers a plausible formation pathway for these systems. We speculate that orbital widening during mass loss could result from the unequal Roche-lobe sizes of the components and eruptive mass loss driven by the donor's high-opacity subsurface layers. Similar mass loss may also be relevant for all other classes of post-mass-transfer binaries that face analogous evolutionary challenges, including Gaia neutron star and white dwarf systems, binaries hosting stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Intra-night optical polarization monitoring of blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are known for their extreme variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Variability at very short timescales can push the boundaries between competing models offering us much needed discriminating power. This is particularly true for polarization variability that allows us to probe particle acceleration and high-energy emission models in blazars. Here we present results from the first pilot study of intra-night optical polarization monitoring conducted using RoboPol at the Skinakas Observatory and supplemented by observations from the Calar Alto, Perkins, and Sierra Nevada observatories. Our results show that while variability patterns can widely vary between sources, variability on timescales as short as minutes is prevalent in blazar jets. The amplitude of variations are typically small, a few percent for the polarization degree and less than 20 degrees for the polarization angle, pointing to a significant contribution to the optical emission from a turbulent magnetic field component, while the overall stability of the polarization angle over time points to a preferred magnetic field orientation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Simulations of Supersonic Shear Flows: I) Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersonic flows are ubiquitous in warm and cool media; their dissipation leads to heating, generation of nonthermal particles, and amplification of background magnetic fields. We present 2D hybrid (kinetic ions - fluid electrons) simulations of decaying shear flows across the subsonic-to-supersonic transition, finding that the canonical Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in subsonic cases gives way to the formation of shocklets in supersonic shears, where dissipation is faster and nonthermal particles are produced. We discuss the dependence on the flow Mach number of particle acceleration, the viscosity induced by kinetic effects, and the production of magnetic turbulence. We outline the potential impact of these findings for turbulence in the warm interstellar medium, for molecular clouds, and for accretion disks, leaving to a companion paper the discussion of the effects on the shear of self-generated and pre-existing energetic particles.</description>

      <title>The Quiescent Merging Nature of the Coma Cluster Revealed by ICM Velocity Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot gas permeating galaxy clusters-the intracluster medium (ICM)-is a key tracer of their assembly history and internal dynamics. Understanding the motion of this gas provides critical insight into processes such as mergers, turbulence, and energy dissipation in the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. The Coma cluster is a nearby, massive system long suspected to be dynamically disturbed. Previous high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the XRISM mission revealed bulk motions in the cluster core and southern regions. Here we present new XRISM Resolve observations of a northern region in Coma, which reveal a coherent velocity gradient of nearly $530 km/s across the cluster from south to north. We find that the hot gas in this northern region exhibits modest line-of-sight motions and uniform thermodynamic properties, indicating relatively mild local disturbances. The consistent levels of turbulence throughout the cluster suggest that the energy from a past merger has been distributed on large scales. These findings provide compelling evidence for an off-axis merger event and demonstrate how high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can uncover subtle dynamical signatures in the ICM, offering important constraints for simulations of cluster evolution.</description>

      <title>XSNAP: An X-ray Supernova Analysis Pipeline with Application to the Type II Supernova 2024ggi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations of Type II supernovae (SNe II) probe the physics of supernova (SN) shocks and the mass-loss histories of their progenitor stars. We present multi-epoch, X-ray observations of SN II 2024ggi ($D \approx 7.2 \ \rm Mpc$) from ${\it Swift}$-XRT, ${\it Chandra}$ and ${\it XMM}$, which cover $\sim 1 - 344$ days since first light. We analyze these observations using a new open-source Python package called $\texttt{XSNAP}$, which standardizes a unified command-line interface for instrument-specific reduction and spectral extraction. $\texttt{XSNAP}$ introduces application programming interfaces for per-epoch spectral modeling through $\texttt{PyXspec}$ and $\texttt{emcee}$ Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting. We employ ${\tt XSNAP}$ to model the multi-epoch X-ray spectra of SN 2024ggi with an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung model and calculate a steady progenitor mass-loss rate of $(6.2\pm0.2)\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ $(v_{\rm wind} = 20 \ \rm km \ s^{-1})$, for which the detected X-ray emission traces the final 117 years before explosion. The software is publicly available on GitHub, with a released package on the Python Package Index (PyPI).</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-Poor Superluminous Supernovae in the Nebular Phase: Spectral Diversity Due to Ejecta Ionization as a Probe of the Power Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a large sample of 39 nebular-phase optical spectra of 25 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) and jointly analyze them with previously published spectra of 12 events. We measure the properties of key emission features, namely those at 6300, 7300, and 7774 angstroms (associated with [O I], [Ca II]/[O II], and O I, respectively), and find that SLSNe exhibit much wider spectral diversity than normal SNe Ic, primarily in the line ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, which is highly sensitive to ejecta ionization. Some events exhibit weak [O I] and a clear [O II] contribution to the 7300 angstrom feature, enhancing the ratio, along with [O III] lines at 4363 and 5007 angstroms. Other SLSNe show weak or no lines of ionized oxygen. Moreover, we find that the population exhibits decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ over time, while a few outliers instead display sustained high or increasing ratios for extended periods. The ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ is also correlated with the rise and decline times of the light curves, with slower events exhibiting higher ionization, the first robust connection between early light curve and late-time spectral properties, likely due to the magnetar's impact: slower-evolving SLSNe are generally powered by engines with longer spin-down timescales, which deposit more energy at later phases. Among the events with decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, SLSNe with high ionization are on average powered by magnetars with higher thermalized spin-down power, a correlation that is most significant for events with $M_{\rm ej}\lesssim12$ M$_{\odot}$. The ionization in the outliers with increasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ may be due to late CSM interaction. $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ and its evolution are therefore key diagnostics of SLSN engines and progenitor mass loss.</description>

      <title>EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov Telescope: Overview and First Neutrino Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth-skimming tau neutrinos with energies above $\sim 10$ PeV can convert to tau leptons that decay in the atmosphere and initiate upward-going extensive air showers that generate optical Cherenkov signals. On a curtailed NASA balloon flight in May 2023, the Cherenkov telescope (CT) on the Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 2 (EUSO-SPB2) was launched and had a short flight at $\sim 30$ km altitude. With some time pointing below the Earth's limb, EUSO-SPB2 CT data allow searches for neutrino events that yield optical flashes from the forward-beamed Cherenkov light. We present an overview of the CT and provide upper limits for the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux from flight data as a proof-of-principle demonstration. We also briefly describe how the methodology is extended to potential transient neutrino point sources.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an X-ray bridge between the comma-shaped gas and the main cluster in MCXC J0157.4-0550</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a faint X-ray bridge connecting between the comma-shaped gas and the main cluster in MCXC J0157.4-0550, using {\it XMM-Newton} image. The filamentary structure is found in a model-independent manner in both topological features and Gaussian Gradient Magnitude filtering. The X-ray surface brightness profile perpendicular to the filament is detected at a $5.5\sigma$ level. Weak-lensing (WL) analysis using the Subaru/HSC-SSP Survey archive data strongly supports the two mass components. Given a prior from the stellar masses, we obtain $M_{200}^{\rm main}=2.68_{-0.92}^{+1.11}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ and $M_{200}^{\rm sub}=0.46_{-0.22}^{+0.38}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$. The main axis of the projected halo distribution is more likely to align with the direction of the main cluster than to be oriented perpendicularly. Similar X-ray distributions have been identified in the literature on numerical simulations. The filamentary structure forms in the following manner: as the gas is stripped by ram pressure near the pericenter, it gets dragged by tidal rotation. Once free from this rotation, the gas moves inertially in a direction parallel to the tangential velocity at the pericenter. The comma-shaped gas, with tails pointing in the opposite direction to the main cluster, is also formed by the current tidal rotation as it moves away from the main cluster. This warrants us that, although it is sometimes thought based on the X-ray morphology alone that the tail is pointing in the opposite direction to the merger motion, this is not necessarily the case. The information of the X-ray filamentary remnant from the cluster merger, together with the 2D WL shear data, provides constraints on the merger parameters, indicating an infalling velocity of approximately $1000\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ and an impact parameter of $0.9$ Mpc.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Applicability of the Hartle-Thorne and Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu Methods for Modeling Rotating Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars, which are composed of extremely dense nuclear matter, serve as natural laboratories to study nuclear interactions beyond the terrestrial experiments. Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\Omega=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory globally, the cosmic-ray muon flux is significantly reduced due to the substantial shielding provided by the overlying mountain. From 2016 to 2020, we measured the muon flux in the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) with a plastic scintillator muon telescope system, detecting 161 muon events over an effective live time of 1098 days. The detection efficiency was obtained by simulating the underground muon energy and angular distributions and the telescope system's response to underground muons. The cosmic-ray muon flux is determined to be (3.03 $\pm$ 0.24 (stat) $\pm$ 0.18 (sys)) $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is the lowest among underground laboratories worldwide.</description>

      <title>Highly Polarized Intrinsic Emission and its Orthogonal Counterpart in Vela X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vela X-1 is one of the most archetypal wind-fed X-ray pulsars (XRPs), and the emergence of its orthogonal polarization states reveals distinctive polarimetric properties. Using data from Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of Vela X-1, we perform a polarization analysis of Vela X-1 using a triple power-law spectral model absorbed by varying column densities, successfully isolating two physically distinct orthogonal polarized components. The first polarized component corresponds to emission from the accretion mound surface that is not obscured by the wind clumps, with its polarization degree (PD) exceeding 30\%. In specific phase intervals, the PD reaches \(50.9 \pm 10.7\%\). This marks the first detection of such highly polarized neutron star emission in an XRP. The second polarized component likely originates from complex physical processes within or near the accretion mound, with its PD showing a potential negative correlation with column density. Furthermore, by rotating the predicted polarization angle (PA) of the first polarized component by 90$^\circ$, we successfully achieve separate fitting and simultaneous fitting of the two orthogonal polarization states using the rotating vector model (RVM).</description>

      <title>A glitch in the millisecond pulsar J0900$-$3144</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of a glitch in the millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J0900$-$3144, which is included in the European, MeerKAT and Parkes pulsar timing array experiments. The dataset combines observations from the MeerKAT, Nan\c{c}ay, Lovell, and Murriyang telescopes, spanning a total baseline of approximately 14 years. The glitch occurred on MJD~59942(17), with a measured fractional spin frequency step of $\Delta \nu_g / \nu=1.15(13) \times 10^{-12}$. This event represents the third glitch detected in a MSP, following those in PSRs B1821$-$24A and J0613$-$0200. Although smaller in amplitude than the previous two, the glitch in PSR J0900$-$3144 is of a comparable order of magnitude. The updated MSP glitch rate is $2.5(1)\times 10^{-3}$ glitches per pulsar per year, which suggests it is likely current PTAs will detect another MSP glitch within five years. Using simulations, we demonstrate that such small glitches can go undetected, especially in short datasets such as those from new PTAs, and can bias the inferred achromatic noise model parameters, potentially leading to the down-weighting of the pulsar in gravitational wave background searches.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Multi-Wavelength Afterglow of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts with a Plateau Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibiting a plateau phase provide valuable insights into the post-merger activity of their central engines. Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray--only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane. This offset, consistent with the observed harder spectrum of short GRBs, may serve as a useful diagnostic for investigating the progenitor as larger samples are available.</description>

      <title>Star clusters in the gamma-ray sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as additional contributors to Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs), to overcome the limitations of supernova remnants (SNRs) to reach the highest energy end of the CR spectrum. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies, and their energetics is enough to account for a non-negligible fraction of the Galactic CRs. Anyhow, the theoretical expectations need to be corroborated by clear observations. Despite the increasing number of detections at different energies, the contamination of other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from stellar winds only, unless one selects objects younger than a few million years, namely before stars start to explode inside clusters. I will review the results obtained with gamma-ray data towards a few massive young star clusters and discuss what implications these result have, especially concerning their contribution to the bulk of Galactic CRs.</description>

      <title>The Dawes Review 13: A New Look at The Dynamic Radio Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>The impact of supermassive black holes on exoplanet habitability: I. Spanning the natural mass range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the influence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity on habitability has garnered attention, the specific effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) winds, particularly ultrafast outflows (UFOs), on planetary atmospheres remain largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between SMBH mass at the galactic center and exoplanetary habitability, given that SMBH masses are empirically confirmed to span approximately 5 orders of magnitude in galaxies. Through simplified models, we account for various results involving the relationships between the distance from the planet to the central SMBH and the mass of the SMBH. Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\sim100\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\geq 10^8 M_\odot$ in the energy-driven case. This study emphasizes that SMBH growth over cosmic time may have produced markedly different impacts on galactic habitability, depending on both the mass of the central black hole (BH) and the location of planetary systems within their host galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) mission concept is a proposed mission to NASA's Astrophysics Probe Explorer (APEX) call. The concept features a cryogenically cooled 1.8 m diameter telescope, and is designed to carry two science instruments covering the 24 to 264 $\mu$m wavelength range: an imaging polarimeter (PRIMAger) and a spectrometer (FIRESS). The majority of PRIMA's time (75%) will be open to observations proposed by the community (General Observer science / GO), and all of data will be publicly available for archival research (Guest Investigator science / GI). Following up on the successful community engagement created by the first volume of the GO PRIMA Science Book (arXiv:2310.20572), Volume 2 gathers 120 new and updated contributed science cases which could be performed within the context of the PRIMA GO/GI program. This volume reflects the strong development of the community interest, awareness and involvement in PRIMA, and further develops how PRIMA's unprecedented capabilities can be leveraged for an impactful and innovative GO/GI program covering most areas of astrophysics and over 90% of the scientific questions and discovery areas in the Astro2020 decadal survey.</description>

      <title>NJL-Chiral Soliton and the Nucleon Equation of State at supra-saturation density: Impact of Chiral Symmetry Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that, at sufficiently high baryon densities, the equation of state (EoS) of bulk nuclear matter can be identified with that of the nucleon core. In this work, we illustrate how the energy density and pressure distributions inside individual nucleons can be utilized to construct the EoS of supra-dense matter. In our framework, nucleons arise as topological solitons stabilized by vector mesons, which are dynamically generated through the path integral bosonization of an underlying Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The restoration of chiral symmetry is implemented dynamically via a self-consistent, density-dependent scalar field, which modifies the (isovector) and (isoscalar) channels of the soliton. We analyze the resulting changes in soliton properties for different NJL parameter sets and demonstrate that the progressive restoration of chiral symmetry leads to a stiffening of the soliton-based EoS, making it compatible with existing neutron star EoSs. An EoS constructed from the solutions of the energy-density and pressure profiles at the center of the nucleon is also explored.</description>

      <title>Shadow-Induced Warps in Protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shadows are commonly observed in protoplanetary disks in near-infrared and (sub)millimeter images, often cast by misaligned inner disks or other obscuring material. While recent studies show that shadows can alter disk dynamics, only the case symmetric across the midplane (e.g., from a polar-aligned inner disk) has been studied. Here we study shadows cast by an inner disk with a $30^\circ$ mutual inclination using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. Given the same shadow shape and amplitude, the $30^\circ$ inclined shadow leads to a much stronger accretion compared with the polar case, reaching $\alpha \sim$ 1, because the disk is squeezed twice in one azimuth, leading to shocks and strong radial flows near the midplane. The outer disk develops a warp: the inner disk region tilts toward alignment with the shadow, while the outer, exponentially tapered disk tilts and twists in a different direction, inclined $\sim$ 32$^\circ$ relative to the inner region. Locally isothermal simulations with a prescribed temperature structure reproduce the effect, confirming that it is thermally driven. Fourier-Hermite analysis shows that it is the m=1, n=1 temperature perturbation that drives the warp by launching bending waves, with the tilting response of the disk approximately proportional to the modal amplitude. This mode always exists unless the shadow is coplanar or polar. Given a fixed temperature contrast, the m=1,n=1 mode peaks at $\sim$15$^\circ$ mutual inclination, but still contributes substantially across 3$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$. Shadows cause disk warps--they are not only a consequence of them. We discuss testable predictions for current and future ALMA and NIR observations.</description>

      <title>An optical--mid-infrared color evolution tool for nova identification using WISE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for characterizing nova candidates by exploiting the infrared capabilities of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalog. We developed a pipeline to identify novae based on well-defined infrared criteria, and leveraging this pipeline, we successfully identified 41 optically confirmed novae in the WISE catalog. In particular, we focus on the color difference between the optical V band and the WISE 3.4 microns W1 band as a diagnostic. We compared their infrared light curves with their optical counterparts. We identified a strong correlation from which we proposed a color difference model that can be used for further identification and characterization of novae. Our analysis validates the mass-loss timescale theory, which predicts that systems with lower accretion rates accumulate larger envelopes and produce more massive ejecta. We also confirm models' prediction that the early color evolution of novae is governed by ejecta expansion and cooling. From our sample statistics, we infer a Galactic nova rate of approximately 40 to 50 novae per year, consistent with modern and infrared-corrected estimates. The resultant model from this work paves the way for future large-scale investigations of nova candidates.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curve Reconstruction: A Comparative Machine and Deep Learning Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20091v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), observed at high-z, are probes of the evolution of the Universe and can be used as cosmological tools. Thus, we need correlations with small dispersion among key parameters. To reduce such a dispersion, we mitigate gaps in light curves (LCs), including the plateau region, key to building the two-dimensional Dainotti relation between the end time of plateau emission (Ta) and its luminosity (La). We reconstruct LCs using nine models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Bi-Mamba, Fourier Transform, Gaussian Process-Random Forest Hybrid (GP-RF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Conditional GAN (CGAN), SARIMAX-based Kalman filter, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), and Attention U-Net. These methods are compared to the Willingale model (W07) over a sample of 521 GRBs. MLP and Attention U-Net outperform other methods, with MLP reducing the plateau parameter uncertainties by 37.2% for log Ta, 38.0% for log Fa, and 41.2% for alpha (the post-plateau slope in the W07 model), achieving the lowest 5-fold cross-validation (CV) mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0275. Attention U-Net achieved the lowest uncertainty of parameters, a 37.9% reduction in log Ta, a 38.5% reduction in log Fa and a 41.4% reduction in alpha, but with a higher MSE of 0.134. Although Attention U-Net achieves the largest uncertainty reduction, the MLP attains the lowest test MSE while maintaining comparable uncertainty performance, making it the more reliable model. The other methods yield MSE values ranging from 0.0339 to 0.174. These improvements in parameter precision are needed to use GRBs as standard candles, investigate theoretical models, and predict GRB redshifts through machine learning.</description>

      <title>Establishing a Connection Between the Jet and the Corona in Black Hole Low Mass X-Ray Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-mass black hole X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) undergo outbursts, during which their brightness increases greatly for timescales of months. The X-ray accretion and radio jet properties change dramatically throughout an outburst in a broadly consistent way between sources. Changes to the accretion flow and the corona are evident through X-ray spectral variations, while the jet's evolution produces changes in the radio. Typically, high energy emission from the corona initially dominate the X-ray spectrum, and quasi-steady compact jets are observed in the radio. As the outburst progresses, emission from the corona fades and is superseded by lower energy X-ray accretion disk emission. During this transition, the compact jets are quenched and discrete ejecta, called transient jets, are launched. The concurrence of the corona's weakening and the jet's transition from compact to transient implies a connection, but the precise relationship has not been established. Motivated by this, we aim to investigate the corona-jet connection. We perform spectral modeling in the hard and soft X-ray, utilizing $NuSTAR$, $NICER$, and $Swift$/XRT observations to track the evolving X-ray corona for three LMXBs: MAXI J1348-630, MAXI J1535-571 and MAXI J1820+070. We use prior work to mark the presence of compact jets and the dates of discrete jet ejections. We find a clear connection between the evolution of the corona and the jet: across all three sources an increase in the distance of the corona from the black hole occurs near the time that the compact jet is quenched and the transient jet is launched.</description>

      <title>Braking index of the frequently glitching PSR J0537$-$6910</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pulsar J0537$-$6910 undergoes spin-up glitches more frequently than any other known pulsar, at a rate of roughly thrice per year. Its glitches are typically large and accompanied by spin-down rate changes $\Delta\dot\nu$ that partially recover with a nearly constant positive frequency second derivative $\ddot\nu$ for the post-glitch intervals. The long-term value of $\ddot\nu$, however, is negative because $\dot\nu$ has decreased over the years of observations. We wish to determine if permanent shifts (non-relaxing parts of the glitch change $\Delta\dot\nu$ in the spin-down rate, like those observed in the Crab pulsar) can explain the long-term enhancement of the spin-down rate which results in an effective negative braking index. We demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that the actual braking index associated with the pulsar's braking torque can be n~3 if the internal superfluid torque and permanent shifts are considered. We use published RXTE and NICER data to calculate the average permanent shift per glitch needed to bring an underlying braking index $n$ to the effective long-term value n' =-1.2 inferred from the data. We use this average value as the actual permanent shift in each glitch and extract the contributions of the internal and external torques to $\ddot\nu$, under the assumption that the next glitch occurs when all glitch-induced offsets to internal torques are fully restored. We find that if the braking index of the magnetospheric torque is close to n~3, moderate permanent changes of the spin-down rate are required, similar to those inferred for the Crab pulsar. The natural mechanism to produce such permanent changes is crustquakes. Crustal failure associated with PSR J0537$-$6910 glitches can have interesting and potentially observable consequences, such as transient changes of the X-ray emission, activation of radio emission, or emission of gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: Mitigating data gaps in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) light curves (LCs) is crucial for cosmological research, enhancing the precision of parameters, assuming perfect satellite conditions for complete LC coverage with no gaps. This analysis improves the applicability of the two-dimensional Dainotti relation, which connects the rest-frame end time of the plateau emission (Ta) and its luminosity (La), derived from the fluxes (Fa). The study expands on a previous 521 GRB sample by incorporating seven models: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Hybrid CNN with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM), Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), Polynomial Curve Fitting, Isotonic Regression, and Quartic Smoothing Spline (QSS). Results indicate that QSS significantly reduces uncertainty across parameters: 43.5% for log Ta, 43.2% for log Fa, and 48.3% for alpha, outperforming the other models where alpha denotes the slope post-plateau based on Willingale 2007 functional form. The Polynomial Curve Fitting model demonstrates moderate uncertainty reduction across parameters, while CNN-BiLSTM has the lowest outlier rate for alpha at 0.77%. These models broaden the application of machine-learning techniques in GRB LC analysis, enhancing uncertainty estimation and parameter recovery, and complement traditional methods like the Attention U-Net and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These advancements highlight the potential of GRBs as cosmological probes, supporting their role in theoretical model discrimination via LC parameters, serving as standard candles, and facilitating GRB redshift predictions through advanced machine-learning approaches.</description>

      <title>EP250207b is not a collapsar fast X-ray transient. Is it due to a compact object merger?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13039</link>

Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are short-lived extra-galactic X-ray sources. Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types. These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray, optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the late-time (~30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted) dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Analysis of Afterglows from Poorly Localised GRBs with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) All-sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), particularly those detected by wide-field instruments such as the Fermi/GBM, pose a challenge for optical follow-up due to their large initial localisation regions, leaving many GRBs without identified afterglows. The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic rapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and localising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities, including Fermi, SVOM, Swift, and EP, providing early optical positions for coordinated multiwavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical afterglow localisation and multiband follow-up of five Fermi/GBM (240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and 241228B) and two MAXI/GSC (240122A and 240225B) triggered long GRBs (LGRBs) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no spectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields precise redshifts spanning $z\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics of host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the presence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with Fermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying $&gt;3\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble those of typical LGRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the LGRBs' average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows yields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic energies ($E_{jet}\sim10^{51-52}$)erg, consistent with the canonical LGRB population. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised GRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high spectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and central engine diversity.</description>

      <title>Galactic X-ray Transients in the First eROSITA All Sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although a multitude of studies have focused on targeted observations of Galactic X-ray transients, blind surveys and population studies have been limited. We have used the ROSAT, eROSITA and Gaia source catalogs to find Galactic X-ray transients having timescales $&lt;$30 years. We report the properties of 738 transients found in our search, majority of which are active stars or interacting binaries. We have also found $\sim$40 compact object systems among which are at least 8 newly-identified white-dwarf systems, 3 known X-ray binaries, and one known pulsar. We use eROSITA (soft X-ray) spectra of the Galactic transients to show that two distinct types of flaring systems are prevalent: one having peak around 1 keV, well fit by thermal models, and another having peak below 0.2 keV and requiring a power-law component. Our study also reveals that single star or interacting binary systems (X-ray transients) involving giant stars exhibit significantly higher X-ray luminosities than systems involving only main-sequence stars or young stellar objects. Finally, we discuss the properties of the transients in the context of their putative emission mechanisms, the fraction of transients with respect to the total population, and the rates of Galactic transients expected in blind searches of the X-ray sky.</description>

      <title>ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz) and S250818k: A Candidate Superkilonova from a Sub-threshold Sub-Solar Gravitational Wave Trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported gravitational waves from a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger. If astrophysical, this event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger. The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve this tantalizing multi-messenger association.</description>

      <title>Flavor Matters, but Matter Flavors: Matter Effects on Flavor Composition of Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that high-energy astrophysical neutrinos produced in the cores of heavily obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can undergo strong matter effects, thus significantly influencing their source flavor ratios. In particular, matter effects can completely modify the standard interpretation of the flavor ratio measurements in terms of the physical processes occurring in the sources (e.g., $pp$ versus $p\gamma$, full pion-decay chain versus muon-damped pion decay). We contrast our results with the existing flavor ratio measurements at IceCube, as well as with projections for next-generation neutrino telescopes like IceCube-Gen2. Signatures of these matter effects in neutrino flavor composition would not only bring more evidence for neutrino production in central AGN regions, but would also be a powerful probe of heavily Compton-thick AGNs, which escape conventional observation in $X$-rays and other electromagnetic wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Unified nonparametric equation-of-state inference from the neutron-star crust to perturbative-QCD densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), while valid only at densities exceeding those found in the cores of neutron stars, could provide constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In this work, we examine the impact of pQCD information on the inference of the EOS using a nonparametric framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We examine the application of pQCD constraints through a "pQCD likelihood," and verify the findings of previous works; namely, a softening of the EOS at the central densities of the most massive neutron stars and a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass. Although the pQCD likelihood can be easily integrated into existing EOS inference frameworks, this approach requires an arbitrary selection of the density at which the constraints are applied. The EOS behavior is also treated differently on either side of the chosen density. To mitigate these issues, we extend the EOS model to higher densities, thereby constructing a "unified" description of the EOS from the neutron-star crust to densities relevant for pQCD. In this approach the pQCD constraints effectively become part of the prior. Since the EOS is unconstrained by any calculation or data between the densities applicable to neutron stars and pQCD, we argue for maximum modeling flexibility in that regime. We compare the unified EOS with the traditional pQCD likelihood, and although we confirm the EOS softening, we do not see a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass or any impact on macroscopic observables. Though residual model dependence cannot be ruled out, we find that pQCD suggests the speed of sound in the densest neutron-star cores has already started decreasing toward the asymptotic limit; we find that the speed of sound squared at the center of the most massive neutron star has an upper bound of $\sim 0.5$ at the $90\%$ level.</description>
