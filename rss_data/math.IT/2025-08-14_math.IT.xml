      <title>Using nonassociative algebras to classify skew polycyclic codes up to isometry and equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry for skew polycyclic codes that will lead to tighter classifications than existing ones. This helps to reduce the number of previously known isometry and equivalence classes, and state precisely when these different notions coincide. In the process, we classify classes of skew $(f,\sigma,\delta)$-polycyclic codes with the same performance parameters, to avoid duplicating already existing codes.
  We exploit that the generator of a skew polycyclic code is in one-one correspondence with the generator of a principal left ideal in its ambient algebra. Algebra isomorphisms that preserve the Hamming distance (called isometries) map generators of principal left ideals to generators of principal left ideals and preserve length, dimension and Hamming distance of the codes. We allow the ambient algebras to be nonassociative, thus eliminating the need on restrictions on the length of the codes. The isometries between the ambient algebras can also be used to classify corresponding linear codes equipped with the rank metric.</description>

      <title>Space-time Coded Differential Modulation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) hold the promise of improving significantly coverage, as well as spectral and energy efficiency in wireless communication systems. Techniques based on RIS form a key technology for 6G systems. An important issue in RIS technology is Channel State Information (CSI), which is much more difficult to acquire in such systems. This work introduces a Differential Space-Time Modulation (DSTM) scheme integrated with Differential Reflecting Modulation (DRM) to bypass the requirement for CSI in such systems, while providing error rate gains. The DSTM scheme is based on unitary group codes. We first consider uncoded DRM for RIS to serve as a reference point. Next we provide an overview of DSTM and outline the procedures for its integration with DRM. Furthermore, we explore the extension of both the original DRM and the coded DRM-DSTM scheme to a larger number of RIS reflecting patterns $K$, and provide tables of codes for $K= 2, 3, 4$. Encoding and decoding complexities are studied as well. Extensives simulation results over quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels confirm the effectiveness of the DRM-DSTM coded system, illustrating its advantages over uncoded DRM with proper system parameters.</description>

      <title>The Conditional Regret-Capacity Theorem for Batch Universal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a conditional version of the classical regret-capacity theorem. This result can be used in universal prediction to find lower bounds on the minimal batch regret, which is a recently introduced generalization of the average regret, when batches of training data are available to the predictor. As an example, we apply this result to the class of binary memoryless sources. Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional Sibson's mutual information.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Index and Code Index Modulations for Spread CPM Signals in Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Internet of Things technologies is driven by four key demands: ultra-low power consumption, high spectral efficiency, reduced implementation cost, and support for massive connectivity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two novel modulation schemes that integrate continuous phase modulation (CPM) with spread spectrum (SS) techniques. We begin by establishing the quasi-orthogonality properties of CPM-SS sequences. The first scheme, termed IM-CPM-SS, employs index modulation (IM) to select spreading sequences from the CPM-SS set, thereby improving spectral efficiency while maintaining the constant-envelope property. The second scheme, referred to as CIM-CPM-SS, introduces code index modulation (CIM), which partitions the input bits such that one subset is mapped to phase-shift keying symbols and the other to CPM-SS sequence indices. Both schemes are applied to downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. We analyze their performance in terms of bit error rate (BER), spectral and energy efficiency, computational complexity, and peak-to-average power ratio characteristics under nonlinear amplifier conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that both schemes outperform conventional approaches in BER while preserving the benefits of constant-envelope, continuous-phase signaling. Furthermore, they achieve higher spectral and energy efficiency and exhibit strong resilience to nonlinear distortions in downlink NOMA scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Remote Sensing in LEO Satellite Systems: Protocol, Architecture and Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of communication and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based remote sensing in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems to provide real-time SAR imaging and information transmission. Considering the high-mobility characteristics of satellite channels and limited processing capabilities of satellite payloads, we propose an integrated communication and remote sensing architecture based on an orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) signal waveform. Both communication and SAR imaging functionalities are achieved with an integrated transceiver onboard the LEO satellite, utilizing the same waveform and radio frequency (RF) front-end. Based on such an architecture, we propose a transmission protocol compatible with the 5G NR standard using downlink pilots for joint channel estimation and SAR imaging. Furthermore, we design a unified signal processing framework for the integrated satellite receiver to simultaneously achieve high-performance channel sensing, low-complexity channel equalization and interference-free SAR imaging. Finally, the performance of the proposed integrated system is demonstrated through comprehensive analysis and extensive simulations in the sub-6 GHz band. Moreover, a software-defined radio (SDR) prototype is presented to validate its effectiveness for real-time SAR imaging and information transmission in satellite direct-connect user equipment (UE) scenarios within the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band.</description>

      <title>Predictive Position Control for Movable Antenna Arrays in UAV Communications: A Spatio-Temporal Transformer-LSTM Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex urban environments, dynamic obstacles and multipath effects lead to significant link attenuation and pervasive coverage blind spots. Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MapLibre Tile: A Next Generation Vector Tile Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) format is widely considered the leading open standard for large-scale map visualization, as evidenced by its widespread adoption by major technology companies such as AWS, Meta, and Microsoft for their products and services. However, MVT was developed nearly a decade ago and, consequently, does not fully align with the capabilities of new geospatial data sources that are characterized by rapidly increasing data volumes due to advancements in geospatial sensors and automated detection through artificial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce the MapLibre Tile (MLT) format, a novel vector tile specification designed from the ground up to address the limitations of MVT. Our experiments, simulating user sessions on widely used basemap datasets, demonstrate that MLT achieves up to three times better compression ratios compared to MVT on encoded tilesets, with over six times better on certain large tiles. Additionally, MLT offers decoding speeds that are up to three times faster and significantly enhances processing performance. MLT also introduces new functionalities and is specifically designed to lay the foundation for the next generation of map renderers, which we expect to entirely offload processing to the GPU, thereby overcoming the stagnation of Moore`s law.</description>

      <title>Contrastive ECOC: Learning Output Codes for Adversarial Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four datasets, our proposed models demonstrate superior robustness to adversarial attacks compared to two baselines. The source is available at https://github.com/YuChou20/Automated-Codebook-Learning-with-Error-Correcting-Output-Code-Technique.</description>

      <title>A Transformer-Based Approach for DDoS Attack Detection in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DDoS attacks have become a major threat to the security of IoT devices and can cause severe damage to the network infrastructure. IoT devices suffer from the inherent problem of resource constraints and are therefore susceptible to such resource-exhausting attacks. Traditional methods for detecting DDoS attacks are not efficient enough to cope with the dynamic nature of IoT networks, as well as the scalability of the attacks, diversity of protocols, high volume of traffic, and variability in device behavior, and variability of protocols like MQTT, CoAP, making it hard to implement security across all the protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., the use of Transformer models, which have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks, for detecting DDoS attacks on IoT devices. The proposed model extracts features from network traffic data and processes them using a self-attention mechanism. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional machine learning techniques, which can be validated by comparing both approaches' accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of this study show that the Transformer models can be an effective solution for detecting DDoS attacks on IoT devices and have the potential to be deployed in real-world IoT environments.</description>

      <title>A Novel Study on Intelligent Methods and Explainable AI for Dynamic Malware Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are one of the security strategies, trained on extensive datasets, and play a critical role in detecting and responding to these threats by recognizing complex patterns in malicious code. However, the opaque nature of these models-often described as "black boxes"-makes their decision-making processes difficult to understand, even for their creators. This research addresses these challenges by integrating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of malware detection models. In this research, the use of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for dynamic malware analysis has been considered, a less explored area, and its efficacy in detecting Metamorphic Malware, and further the effectiveness and transparency of MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and CNN-LSTM models in malware classification, evaluating these models through the lens of Explainable AI (XAI). This comprehensive approach aims to demystify the internal workings of deep learning models, promoting a better understanding and trust in their predictive capabilities in cybersecurity contexts. Such in-depth analysis and implementation haven't been done to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Algorithm for Differentially Private $k$-PCA with Adaptive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $n$ i.i.d. random matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ that share a common expectation $\Sigma$, the objective of Differentially Private Stochastic PCA is to identify a subspace of dimension $k$ that captures the largest variance directions of $\Sigma$, while preserving differential privacy (DP) of each individual $A_i$. Existing methods either (i) require the sample size $n$ to scale super-linearly with dimension $d$, even under Gaussian assumptions on the $A_i$, or (ii) introduce excessive noise for DP even when the intrinsic randomness within $A_i$ is small. Liu et al. (2022a) addressed these issues for sub-Gaussian data but only for estimating the top eigenvector ($k=1$) using their algorithm DP-PCA. We propose the first algorithm capable of estimating the top $k$ eigenvectors for arbitrary $k \leq d$, whilst overcoming both limitations above. For $k=1$ our algorithm matches the utility guarantees of DP-PCA, achieving near-optimal statistical error even when $n = \tilde{\!O}(d)$. We further provide a lower bound for general $k &gt; 1$, matching our upper bound up to a factor of $k$, and experimentally demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm over comparable baselines.</description>

      <title>PAC codes with Bounded-Complexity Sequential Decoding: Pareto Distribution and Code Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a novel variation of polar codes known as polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes has been introduced by Ar{\i}kan. These codes significantly outperform conventional polar and convolutional codes, particularly for short codeword lengths, and are shown to operate very close to the optimal bounds. It has also been shown that if the rate profile of PAC codes does not adhere to certain polarized cutoff rate constraints, the computation complexity for their sequential decoding grows exponentially. In this paper, we address the converse problem, demonstrating that if the rate profile of a PAC code follows the polarized cutoff rate constraints, the required computations for its sequential decoding can be bounded with a distribution that follows a Pareto distribution. This serves as a guideline for the rate-profile design of PAC codes. For a high-rate PAC\,$(1024,899)$ code, simulation results show that the PAC code with Fano decoder, when constructed based on the polarized cutoff rate constraints, achieves a coding gain of more than $0.75$ dB at a frame error rate (FER) of $10^{-5}$ compared to the state-of-the-art 5G polar and LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>On Lattice Isomorphism Problems for Lattices from LCD Codes over Finite Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These days, post-quantum cryptography based on the lattice isomorphism problem has been proposed. Ducas-Gibbons introduced the hull attack, which solves the lattice isomorphism problem for lattices obtained by Construction A from an LCD code over a finite field. Using this attack, they showed that the lattice isomorphism problem for such lattices can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem with the trivial lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem. While the previous work by Ducas-Gibbons only considered lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite field}, this paper considers lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite ring} $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$, which is a more general case. In particular, when $k$ is odd, an odd prime power, or not divisible by $4$, we show that the lattice isomorphism problem can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem for $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum fault tolerance with constant-space and logarithmic-time overheads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a model of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quick and noiseless polyloglog-time auxiliary classical computation, we construct a fault tolerance protocol with constant-space and $\widetilde{O}(\log N)$-time overhead, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides sub-polylog factors. Our construction utilizes constant-rate quantum locally testable codes (qLTC), new fault-tolerant gadgets on qLTCs and qLDPC codes, and a new analysis framework. In particular, 1) we develop a new simple and self-contained construction of magic state distillation for qubits using qudit quantum Reed-Solomon codes with $(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{\gamma}$ spacetime overhead, where $\gamma \rightarrow 0$. 2) We prove that the recent family of almost-good qLTCs of Dinur-Lin-Vidick admit parallel single-shot decoders against adversarial errors of weight scaling with the code distance. 3) We develop logical state preparation and logical gate procedures with $\widetilde{O}(1)$-spacetime overhead on qLTCs. 4) To combine these ingredients, we introduce a new framework of fault tolerance analysis called the weight enumerator formalism. The framework permits easy formal composition of fault-tolerant gadgets, so we expect it to be of independent interest. Our work gives the lowest spacetime overhead to date, which, for the first time, matches that of classical fault tolerance up to sub-polylog factors. We conjecture this is optimal up to sub-polylog factors.</description>

Abstract: Proving threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a burdensome endeavor with many moving parts that come together in relatively formulaic but lengthy ways. It is difficult and rare to combine elements from multiple papers into a single formal threshold proof, due to the use of different measures of fault-tolerance. In this work, we introduce composable fault-tolerance, a framework that decouples the probabilistic analysis of the noise distribution from the combinatorial analysis of circuit correctness, and enables threshold proofs to compose independently analyzed gadgets easily and rigorously. Within this framework, we provide a library of standard and commonly used gadgets such as memory and logic implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum low-density parity check codes and distillation. As sample applications, we explicitly write down a threshold proof for computation with surface code and re-derive the constant space-overhead fault-tolerant scheme of Gottesman using gadgets from this library. We expect that future fault-tolerance proofs may focus on the analysis of novel techniques while leaving the standard components to the composable fault-tolerance framework, with the formal proof following the intuitive ``napkin math'' exactly.</description>
