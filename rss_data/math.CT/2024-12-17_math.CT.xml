      <title>The Relational Quotient Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking a quotient roughly means changing the notion of equality on a given object, set or type. In a quantitative setting, equality naturally generalises to a distance, measuring how much elements are similar instead of just stating their equivalence. Hence, quotients can be understood quantitatively as a change of distance.
  In this paper, we show how, combining Lawvere's doctrines and the calculus of relations, one can unify quantitative and usual quotients in a common picture. More in detail, we introduce relational doctrines as a functorial description of (the core of) the calculus of relations. Then, we define quotients and a universal construction adding them to any relational doctrine, generalising the quotient completion of existential elementary doctrine and also recovering many quantitative examples. This construction deals with an intensional notion of quotient and breaks extensional equality of morphisms. Then, we describe another construction forcing extensionality, showing how it abstracts several notions of separation in metric and topological structures. Combining these two constructions, we get the extensional quotient completion, whose essential image is characterized through the notion of projective cover. As an application, we show that, under suitable conditions, relational doctrines of algebras arise as the extensional quotient completion of free algebras. Finally, we compare relational doctrines to other categorical structures where one can model the calculus of relations.</description>

      <title>Open Condensed Subgroups and Mackey's Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define what it means for a condensed group action to be open (following Scholze) and show that for open subgroups, many elementary results about abstract modules hold for condensed modules, such as the existence of Mackey's Formula for condensed groups. We also indicate how these results can be "solidified" to obtain their solid versions.</description>

      <title>Higher Vector Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.01062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce higher analogs for cleavages in the context of (Kan) simplicial fibrations. We apply them to obtain geometric models for representations up to homotopy of (higher) Lie groupoids. Concretely, we set an equivalence between representations up to homotopy and simplicial vector bundles endowed with a cleavage. Our result is an incarnation of the Higher Grothendieck Correspondence, it can be seen as a relative Dold-Kan Theorem and extends earlier work of Gracia-Saz and Mehta on VB-groupoids.</description>

      <title>Twisted tensor product of dg categories and Kontsevich's Swiss Cheese conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a $1$-algebra. The Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture [K2] states that the homotopy category $\mathrm{Ho}(\mathrm{Act}(A))$ of actions of $2$-algebras on $A$ has a final object and that this object is weakly equivalent to the pair $(\mathrm{Hoch}(A), A),$ where $\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$ is the Hochschild complex of $A$. Here the category of actions is the category whose objects are pairs $(B,A)$ which are algebras of the chain Swiss Cheese operad such that the induced action of the little interval operad on the component $A$ coincides with the $1$-structure on $A$.
  We prove that there is a colored dg operad ${O}$ with 2 colors, weakly equivalent to the chain Swiss Cheese operad for which the following ``stricter" version of the Kontsevich Swiss Cheese conjecture holds. Denote the two colors of ${O}$ by $a$ (for the 1-algebra argument) and $b$ (for the 2-algebra argument), denote by $E_1^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $a$, and by $E_2^{{O}}$ the restriction of ${O}$ to the color $b$. Let $\mathrm{Alg}({O})$ be the category of dg algebras over ${O}$. For a fixed $1$-algebra $A$ we also have the the category of action $\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A$ (equal to $\mathrm{Act}(A)$ in case of the Swiss Cheese operad). We prove that there is an equivalence of categories $$\mathrm{Alg}({O})_A \cong \mathrm{Alg}(E_2^{{O}})/\mathrm{Hoch}(A)$$ We stress that for this particular model of Swiss Cheese operad the statement holds on the chain level, without passage to the homotopy category.</description>

      <title>Stable homology of Lie algebras of derivations and homotopy invariants of wheeled operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18594v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a theorem that computes, for any augmented operad $\mathcal{O}$, the stable homology of the Lie algebra of derivations of the free algebra $\mathcal{O}(V)$ with twisted bivariant coefficients (here stabilization occurs as $\dim(V)\to\infty$) out of the homology of the wheeled bar construction of $\mathcal{O}$; this can further be used to prove uniform mixed representation stability for the homology of the positive part of that Lie algebra with constant coefficients. This result generalizes both the Loday-Quillen-Tsygan theorem on the homology of the Lie algebra of infinite matrices and the Fuchs stability theorem for the homology of the Lie algebra of vector fields. We also prove analogous theorems for the Lie algebras of derivations with constant and zero divergence, in which case one has to consider the wheeled bar construction of the wheeled completion of $\mathcal{O}$. Similarly to how cyclic homology of an algebra $A$ may be viewed as an additive version of the algebraic $K$-theory of $A$, our results hint at the additive $K$-theoretic nature of the wheeled bar construction.</description>

      <title>The index with respect to a contravariantly finite subcategory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster algebras are categorified by cluster categories, and $g$-vectors are categorified by the classic index with respect to cluster tilting subcategories. However, the recently introduced completed discrete cluster categories of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$ have a very limited supply of cluster tilting subcategories, so we define the index with respect to additive, contravariantly finite subcategories of which there are many more.
  This permits us to extend several strong results from the classic theory to completed discrete cluster categories of Dynkin type $\mathbb{A}$. Notably, the index with respect to the subcategory generated by a fan triangulation distinguishes between rigid objects.
  We also prove that our index is additive on triangles up to an error term. This extends the key property which permits the classic index to be used in the categorification of cluster algebras.</description>
