      <title>A prolific solar flare factory. Near-continuous monitoring of an active region nest with Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of active region nests -- locations on the Sun with recurring flux emergence -- are poorly constrained by observations from Earth alone. ESA's Solar Orbiter now monitors the Sun's far-side for extended periods of time; facilitating observations of the entire Sun. We combined observations from near-Earth satellites and Solar Orbiter to evaluate the contribution of a long-lived active region nest to the Sun's global flaring activity. We identified a location in Carrington coordinates with episodic bursts of flux emergence throughout 2022. The combined observations allowed near-continuous monitoring of this region from April to October; during its most active period. GOES and SolO/STIX were used to compare its flaring activity to that of the entire Sun. The region's morphology was extracted from SDO/AIA and SolO/EUI extreme ultraviolet images and combined with magnetic field measurements from SDO/HMI and SolO/PHI to assess its unsigned magnetic flux. The active region nest grew in complexity from January to May due to repeated flux emergence events; with a peak unsigned magnetic flux of $5\times10^{22}$Mx. The region was responsible for 40% of the observed solar flares in 2022, including five months where it produced 50-70% of all flares over the entire Sun (during the near-continuous monitoring window). Of the 17 complex flaring NOAA active regions in 2022 this region contained 10 but occupied less than 20% of the area in the active latitudes. Active region nests can maintain a high rate of flaring activity for several solar rotations and are more likely to produce complex active regions that can trigger X-class solar flares. Improving the identification and monitoring of long-lived active region nests would benefit short to medium term space weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Revealing the ages of metal-rich RR Lyrae via kinematic label transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars have long been considered reliable tracers of old, metal-poor populations, primarily due to their prevalence in globular clusters and the Galactic halo. However, the discovery of a metal-rich subpopulation in the Galactic disc, kinematically colder and more rotationally supported, challenges this classical view. Understanding the age of these metal-rich RR Lyrae stars is crucial for constraining their formation pathways and assessing what Galactic populations they are tracing. In this work, we leverage the unprecedented astrometric precision of Gaia DR3 to infer the age distribution of metal-rich RR Lyrae stars through a kinematic comparison with O-rich Mira variables. Mira variables, with their well-established period-age relation, serve as a natural clock, allowing us to transfer age information to RR Lyrae stars via their phase-space properties. By applying this approach across different metallicity bins, we find that the most metal-rich RR Lyrae stars ($[\rm Fe/H] &gt; -0.5$) exhibit kinematics consistent with a population significantly younger ($\approx 6-7$ Gyr) than typically assumed for RR Lyrae stars. In contrast, those with $-1 &lt; [\rm Fe/H] &lt; -0.5$ show properties more aligned with older ($\approx 9-11$ Gyr) populations. Interestingly, we also find evidence of a possible double age populations for the most metal-rich RR Lyrae, one younger with ages between 3 and 6 Gyr, and another one older ranging from 8 to 11 Gyr. These results provide strong evidence that metal-rich RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic field do not exclusively trace ancient populations. This finding challenges the current model of RR Lyrae formation and supports alternative formation scenarios, such as binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Long-period double-lined eclipsing binaries: the system V454 Aur with the secondary eclipse caused by the occultation of the hotter component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our study of the long-period eclipsing binary star \Aur. The results are based on spectroscopic data obtained with the UFES \'echelle spectrograph and photometric observations from TESS. The derived radial velocity curve is based on 17 spectra obtained between 2021 and 2023, covering all orbital phases of this binary system. The orbital period determined from TESS data, $P = 27.019803 \pm 0.000003$ days, agrees within uncertainties with the period established in previous studies. The model constructed for the TESS photometric light curve achieves a precision of 0.01\%. The effective temperatures of both components, as well as the system metallicity, were directly derived from the spectra and are $T_\mathrm{eff, A} = 6250 \pm 50$\,K, $T_\mathrm{eff, B} = 5855 \pm 50$\,K, and $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} = -0.10 \pm 0.08$, respectively. Our analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic data allowed us to directly compute the luminosities of the components, $L_A = 1.82\,L_\odot$ and $L_B = 1.07\,L_\odot$, their radii, $R_A = 1.15\,R_\odot$ and $R_B = 1.00\,R_\odot$, and their masses, $M_A = 1.137\,M_\odot$ and $M_B = 1.023\,M_\odot$, with uncertainties below 1\%. Comparison with evolutionary tracks indicates that the system's age is $1.18 \pm 0.10$\,Gyr, and both components are still on the main sequence. The \Aur\ system is particularly interesting due to the partial eclipse of the primary component, which results in the ``inversion'' of the primary and secondary minima in the photometric light curve.</description>

      <title>Helioseismic inference of the solar radiative opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun is the most studied of all stars, and thus constitutes a benchmark for stellar models. However, our vision of the Sun is still incomplete, as illustrated by the current debate on its chemical composition. The problem reaches far beyond chemical abundances and is intimately linked to microscopic and macroscopic physical ingredients of solar models such as radiative opacity, for which experimental results have been recently measured that still await theoretical explanations. We present opacity profiles derived from helioseismic inferences and compare them with detailed theoretical computations of individual element contributions using three different opacity computation codes, in a complementary way to experimental results. We find that our seismic opacity is about 10% higher than theoretical values used in current solar models around 2 million degrees, but lower by 35% than some recent available theoretical values. Using the Sun as a laboratory of fundamental physics, we show that quantitative comparisons between various opacity tables are required to understand the origin of the discrepancies between reported helioseismic, theoretical and experimental opacity values.</description>

      <title>Elusive helium stars in the gap between subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars~II. Nonlinear pulsations of stripped helium stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown for the first time that the stripped helium stars with masses 2 to 7 solar mass which are formed in close binary systems in the so-called case B of mass-exchange and retained low-mass hydrogen-helium envelopes, experience nonlinear radial pulsations. Pulsations are excited by the kappa-mechanism due to helium ionization. The region of pulsation instability extends over Hertzsprung-Russel diagram from the red giants branch to the region of effective temperatures from about 30,000 K to about 50,000 K. Variations of stellar luminosity should be observed mostly in the ultraviolet. The amplitudes of pulsations of the studied models reach 0.8 stellar magnitude and increase, as the stellar radii decrease. Pulsation periods of stars with effective temperatures exceeding 10,000 K range from 0.17 to 8.5 day and decrease with decreasing radii. The stars have substantially larger effective temperatures than their companions, which could be Be-stars. They are components of relatively wide binaries with orbital periods up to several years. The number of pulsating moderate-mass stripped helium stars in the Galaxy is about 1000.</description>

      <title>HIP 15429: a newborn Be star on an eccentric binary orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identified a new post-interaction binary, HIP 15429, consisting of a stripped star and a recently formed, rapidly rotating Be star companion ($v \sin i \approx 270$ km/s) sharing many similarities with recently identified bloated stripped stars. From orbital fitting of multi-epoch radial velocities we find a 221-day period. We also find an eccentricity of $e=0.52$, which is unexpectedly high as tides are expected to have circularised the orbit efficiently during the presumed recent mass transfer. The formation of a circumbinary disk during the mass transfer phase or the presence of an unseen tertiary companion might explain the orbit's high eccentricity. We determined physical parameters for both stars by fitting the spectra of the disentangled binary components and multi-band photometry. The stripped nature of the donor star is affirmed by its high luminosity at a low inferred mass ($\lesssim 1 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) and imprints of CNO-processed material in the surface abundances. The donor's relatively large radius and cool temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 13.5 \pm 0.5$ kK) suggest that it has only recently ceased mass transfer. Evolutionary models assuming a 5-6 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ progenitor can reproduce these parameters and imply that the binary is currently evolving towards a stage where the donor becomes a subdwarf orbiting a Be star. The remarkably high eccentricity of HIP 15429 challenges standard tidal evolution models, suggesting either inefficient tidal dissipation or external influences, such as a tertiary companion or circumbinary disk. This underscores the need to identify and characterise more post-mass transfer binaries to benchmark and refine theoretical models of binary evolution.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-14dx: A cataclysmic variable harbouring a massive pulsating white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our study of ASASSN-14dx, a previously known but poorly characterised cataclysmic variable (CV). The source was observed as part of an ongoing high-time-resolution photometric survey of CVs, which revealed that, in addition to the known 82.8min orbital period, it also exhibits other transient periods, the strongest of which around 4 and 14 min. Here, we report our findings resulting from a multifaceted follow-up programme consisting of optical spectroscopy, spectropolarimetry, imaging polarimetry, and multicolour fast photometry. We find that the source displays complex optical variability, which is best explained by the presence of a massive white dwarf exhibiting non-radial pulsations. An intermediate polar-like scenario involving a spinning magnetic white dwarf can be ruled out based on the detected changes in the observed periods. Based on our optical spectroscopy, we can constrain the mass and effective temperature of the white dwarf to be ~1.1 Msol and 16 100 K, respectively. The overall intrinsic flux level of the source is unusually high, suggesting that there remains significant residual emission from the accretion disc and/or the white dwarf even ten years after the 2014 outburst. Finally, we cannot detect any spectroscopic signatures from the donor star, making ASASSN-14dx a possible period bouncer system evolving towards a longer orbital period.</description>

      <title>New empirical mass-loss recipe for UV radiation line-driven winds of hot stars across various metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The winds of massive stars remove a significant fraction of their mass, strongly impacting their evolution. As a star evolves, the rate at which it loses mass changes. In stellar evolution codes, different mass-loss recipes are employed for different evolutionary stages. The choice of the recipes is user-dependent and the conditions for switching between them are poorly defined. Focusing on hot stars, we aim to produce a physically motivated, empirically calibrated mass-loss recipe suitable for a wide range of metallicities. We want to provide a ready-to-use universal recipe that eliminates the need for switching between recipes for hot stars during stellar evolution calculations. We compile a sample of hot stars with reliable stellar and wind parameters in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. The sample is used to determine the dependence of the mass-loss rate on the basic stellar parameters. We find that independent of evolutionary stage and temperature, the wind mass-loss rate is a function of the electron-scattering Eddington parameter ($\Gamma_e$) and metallicity (Z), being in line with expectations of radiation-driven wind theory. Our derived scaling relation provides an adequate ($\Delta$log($\dot{M}$/(M$_\odot$/yr)) = 0.43) and broadly applicable mass-loss recipe for hot stars. The newly derived mass-loss recipe covers nearly the entire parameter space of hot stars with UV radiation-driven winds and eliminates the need for interpolation between mass-loss formulae at different evolutionary stages when applied in stellar evolution models. Examples of stellar evolution calculations using our new recipe reveal that the predictions on the ionizing fluxes and final fates of massive stars, especially at low metallicity, differ significantly from models that use the standard mass-loss rates, impacting our understanding of stellar populations at low metallicity and in the young Universe.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamical state of Galactic open clusters using Gaia DR3 and observational parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic open clusters (OCs) are subject to internal and external destructive effects that gradually deplete their stellar content, leaving imprints on their structure. To investigate their dynamical state from an observational perspective, we employed Gaia DR3 data to perform a comprehensive analysis of 174 OCs (~10% of Dias et al.'s 2021 catalogue). We employed radial density profiles and astrometrically decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams to derive structural parameters, distance, mass and time-related quantities. We explored the parameters space and searched for connections relating the clusters' structure with the internal evolutionary state and the external Galactic tidal field. Correlations were verified after segregating the sample according to the Galactocentric distance and half-light to Jacobi radius ratio ($r_h/R_J$). This tidal filling ratio decreases with both the cluster mass and dynamical age. At a given evolutionary stage, OCs with larger $r_h/R_J$ tend to present larger fractions of mass loss due to dynamical effects. Regarding the impact of the external conditions, we identified different evaporation regimes: for ambient densities ($\rho_{\rm{amb}}$) larger than ~0.1M$_{\odot}$/pc$^3$, clusters tend to be more tidally filled as they are subject to weaker tidal stresses. For $\rho_{\rm{amb}}$ $\lesssim$ 0.1M$_{\odot}$/pc$^3$, the opposite occurs: $R_J$ increases for smaller $\rho_{\rm{amb}}$, causing $r_h/R_J$ to decrease. In turn, two-body relaxation tends to compact the cluster core, which is less sensitive to variations of the external potential. The higher the degree of central concentration, the larger the number of relaxation times a cluster takes until its dissolution.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Modelling of Early Peaks in Type Ibc Supernovae with Shock Cooling Emission from Circumstellar Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-cadence transient surveys have uncovered a rare subclass of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe) that exhibit an early, blue peak lasting a few days before the main, radioactively powered peak. Since progenitors of Type Ibc SNe are typically compact and lack an extended envelope, this early peak is commonly attributed to shock cooling emission from circumstellar matter (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. As such, these SNe provide a unique opportunity to constrain the pre-explosion activity of Type Ibc SN progenitors. We present the first systematic study of this Type Ibc SN population that uses hydrodynamic modelling. We simulated Type Ibc SNe exploding in a CSM using the multi-group radiation-hydrodynamics code STELLA, exploring a range of SN and CSM properties. By comparing the resulting theoretical multi-band light curves to a sample of seven Type Ibc SNe with early peaks, we constrained their CSM properties. Assuming a wind-like density distribution for the CSM, we found CSM masses of $10^{-2} - 10^{-1} \ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and CSM radii of $(1 - 5) \times 10^3 \ \mathrm{R}_\odot$. While the masses were roughly consistent with a previous estimate obtained using an analytical model, the radii were significantly different, likely due to our assumption of spatially spread out CSM. We infer that the progenitors could have created CSM via late-time binary mass transfer or pulsational pair instability. We also estimate that, in the planned ULTRASAT high-cadence survey, $\sim 30$ shock cooling peaks from Type Ibc SNe will be observed.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic diagnostics of high-temperature plasma in stellar corona using Fe XXIV--XXVI K-shell lines with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The RS CVn type binary star GT Mus was observed during its quiescence using the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer onboard XRISM. The main and satellite lines of the Fe XXIV--XXVI K-shell transitions were resolved for the first time from stellar sources. We conducted line ratio analysis to investigate any deviations from collisional onization equilibrium (CIE) and Maxwell electron energy distribution with a single-temperature. By using five combinations of direct excitation lines and dielectronic recombination satellite lines in three line complexes (Fe He$\alpha$, Ly$\alpha$, and He$\beta$), we found that the plasma is well characterized by two-temperature thermal plasmas with temperatures of 1.7 and 4.3 keV, which is consistent with a thermal broadening of Fe XXV and the broadband fitting results in the 1.7--10 keV band. Other forms of deviation from a single-temperature plasma, such as different ionization and electron temperatures or the $\kappa$ distribution for the electron energy distributions, are not favored, which is reasonable for stellar coronae at quiescence. This study demonstrates the utility of the Fe K-shell line ratio diagnostics to probe plasma conditions using X-ray microcalorimeters.</description>

Abstract: Highly magnified stars ($\mu$ $&gt;$ 100) are now outinely identified as transient events at cosmological distances thanks to microlensing by intra-cluster stars near the critical curves of galaxy clusters. Using the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) in combination with the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST), we outline here an analytical framework that is applied to the Warhol arc (at $z=0.94$) in the MACS 0416 galaxy cluster (at $z=0.396)$ where over a dozen microlensed stars have been detected to date. This method is general and can be applied to other lensed arcs. Within this lensed galaxy we fit the spatially resolved SED spanned by eight JWST-NIRCam filters combined with three ACS filters, for accurate lensed star predictions in 2D. With this tool we can generate 2D maps of microlensed stars for well resolved arcs in general, including dependence on wavelength and limiting apparent magnitude, for comparison with with planned cadenced campaigns for JWST and Hubble, for constraining directly the IMF and the level of dark matter substructure.</description>

      <title>Unveiling two deeply embedded young protostars in the S68N Class 0 protostellar core with JWST/NIRSpec</title>

Abstract: The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 -- 5.3 $\mu$m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.95 $\pm$ 0.15 cm s$^{-2}$. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 $\mu$m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast $C$-type shocks ($\geq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), with high pre-shock density ($\geq$ $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3--10, where $B = b\,\times\,\sqrt{\textrm{n}_{\textrm{H}} (\textrm{cm}^{-3})}\,\mu\textrm{G}$) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH$^{+}$ ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.</description>

      <title>Characterizing planetary material accreted by cool helium atmosphere white dwarfs using an exponentially decaying disc model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) observations and model atmosphere analysis for two nearby, cool, helium-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that have been polluted by accretion: WD J1927-0355 and WD J2141-3300. Detected elements common to both white dwarfs are Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni, with additional detections of Na, Al, Si and Sr in WD J2141-3300. We present an approach for inferring the composition of the accreted material, by adopting a physically motivated model in which the mass accretion rate decays exponentially with time, which provides constraints on the time since the start of the accretion event. The accretion events were most likely to have began at least 1 Myr ago, however the characteristic disc lifetime could not be constrained due to degeneracies. Both white dwarfs were found to have accreted bulk planetary material with compositions similar to that of both bulk Earth and chondritic meteorites. The parent bodies causing pollution in both cases were inferred to be the mass of a small moon or dwarf planet.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Enhanced multiplicity of early B-type dwarfs and giants at $Z=0.2\,{\rm Z}_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems, as evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity dependence in the close-binary (a&gt;10 au) fraction or orbital-period distributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\odot$) and that of the LMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor environments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity classes III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch spectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous works, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant radial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction of $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\pm3\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $f_{mult}=80\pm8\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV distribution ($\Delta{\rm RV}_{\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction of $f_{mult}=78\pm5\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation between metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC multiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC and MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may have broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More frequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of exotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and sustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation. Theoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will provide a key test of our results.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Neutrino Magnetic Moments on the Evolution of the Helium Flash and Lithium-Rich Red Clump Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of the neutrino magnetic moment (NMM,$\mu_v$) is one of the most significant challenges in physics. The additional energy loss due to NMM can significantly influence the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. Using the MESA code, we investigated the impact of NMM on the He flash evolution in low-mass stars. We found that NMM leads to an increase in both the critical He core mass required for the He flash and the luminosity of TRGB. For a typical $Z = 1 Z_{\odot}$ , $M$ = 1.0 $M_{\odot}$, and $\mu_v = 3 \times 10^{-12} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ model, the He core mass increases by $\sim 5\%$, and the TRGB luminosity increases by $\sim 35\%$ compared to the model without NMM. However, contrary to previous conclusions, our model indicates that the He flash occurs earlier, rather than delayed, with increasing NMM values. This is because the additional energy loss from NMM accelerates the contraction of the He core, releases more gravitational energy that heats the H shell and increases the hydrogen burning rate, thereby causing the He core to reach the critical mass faster and advancing the He flash. An increase in NMM results in a higher peak luminosity for the first He flash, a more off-center ignition position, and sub-flashes with higher luminosities, shorter intervals, and higher frequency. We found that the internal gravity wave (IGW) mixing generated by the He flash can induce sufficient mixing in the radiative zone, turning the overshoot region into a low-Dmix bottleneck within the stellar interior. The increase in NMM in the model narrows the overshoot bottleneck region, enabling Li to enter the surface convection zone more quickly, thereby enhancing the enrichment effect of IGW mixing on surface Li. For models incorporating both NMM and IGW mixing, the reduction in the overshoot bottleneck region allows them to effectively produce super Li-rich red clump star samples.</description>

      <title>The Local Group Symbiotic Star Population and its Tenuous Link with Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are gravitationally bound stellar systems where the evolution of each component can significantly influence the evolution of its companion and the system as a whole. In certain cases, the evolution of these systems can lead to the formation of a red giant-white dwarf system, which may exhibit symbiotic characteristics. The primary goal of this work is to contribute in a statistical way to the estimation of the symbiotic system (SySt) population in the Milky Way and in the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group (LG). Additionally, we aim to infer the maximum contribution of SySt to Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) events. Given the significant discrepancies in previous estimates, we propose two distinct approaches to constrain the expected SySt population: one empirical and another theoretical. These approaches are designed to provide a robust estimation of the SySt population. For the Milky Way, we utilized position and velocity data of known SySts to determine their distribution. Based on these properties, we constrained the lower limit for the Galactic SySt population in the range of 800-4,100. Our theoretical approach, which relies on the properties of zero-age main-sequence binaries and known binary evolutionary paths, suggests a SySt population of $(53\pm6)\times10^3$ SySt in the Galaxy. The statistical SySt populations for LG dwarf galaxies are one to four orders of magnitude lower, primarily dependent on the galaxies' bolometric luminosity and, to a lesser extent, their binary fraction and metallicity. In this work, the contribution of the single-degenerate channel of SNe Ia from symbiotic progenitors is estimated to be of the order of 1% for the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution modeling for a newly-formed white dwarf resulting from binary white dwarf merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Merger of two white dwarfs (WDs) has been proposed to form an isolated WD having high magnetization and rapid rotation. We study the influence of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind on spin evolution of the newly-formed merger product. We consider the scenario that the merger product appears as a giant-star-like object with a radius of $&gt; 10^{10}$ cm and a luminosity of the order of an Eddington value. We solve a structure of the merger product under the hydrostatic equilibrium and identify the position of the slow-point in the hot envelope. It is found that if such a giant-star-like object is spinning with an angular speed of the order of the Keplerian value, the MHD wind can be produced. The mass-loss rate is estimated to be of the order of $\sim 10^{20-21}~\mathrm{g~s^{-1}}$, and the timescale of the spin down is $\sim 10\text{-}10^{3}$ years, which depends on stellar magnetic field. We discuss that the final angular momentum when the MHD wind is terminated is related to the magnetic flux and initial radiation luminosity of the merger product. We apply our model to three specific magnetic WD sources ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, and PG 1031+234 by assuming that those WDs were as a result of the merger product. We argue that the current periods of ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 and PG 1031+234 that are strongly magnetized WDs are related to the initial luminosity at the giant phase. For SDSS J221141.8+113604.4, which is mildly magnetized WD, its angular momentum was almost determined when the spin-down timescale due to MHD wind is comparable to the cooling timescale in the giant phase.</description>

      <title>Measuring the asymmetric expansion of the Fe ejecta of Cassiopeia A with XRISM/Resolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expansion structure of supernova remnants (SNRs) is important for understanding not only how heavy elements are distributed into space, but also how supernovae explode. The ejecta expansion structure of the young core-collapse SNR Cas A is investigated, with Doppler parameter mapping of the Fe-K complex by the Resolve microcalorimeter onboard the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission, XRISM. It is found that the Fe ejecta are blueshifted in the southeast (SE) and redshifted in the northwest (NW), indicating an incomplete shell structure, similar to the intermediate mass elements (IMEs), such as Si and S. The Fe has a velocity shift of $\sim1400$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the NW and $\sim2160$ km~s$^{-1}$ in the SE region, with the error range of a few 100s km~s$^{-1}$. These values are consistent with those for the IMEs in the NW region, whereas larger than those for the IMEs in the SE region, although the large error region prevented us from concluding which component has significantly higher velocity. The line broadening is larger in the center with values of $\sim$2000--3000~km~s$^{-1}$, and smaller near the edges of the remnant. The radial profiles of the Doppler shift and broadening of the IMEs and Fe indicate that the Fe ejecta may expand asymmetrically as IME ejacta, although the large error regions do not allow us to conclude it. Moreover, we see little bulk Doppler broadening of the Fe lines in the northeastern jet region whereas the IME lines exhibit significant broadening. No such narrow lines are detected in the NW region. These findings suggest an asymmetric expansion of the ejecta potentially driven by large-scale asymmetries originating from the supernova explosion. This interpretation aligns with the large-scale asymmetries predicted by models of neutrino-driven supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>H, He-like recombination spectra VI: Quadrupole $l$-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>
