      <title>$B_{n-1}$-orbits on the flag variety and the Bruhat graph for $S_{n}\times S_{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=G_{n}=GL(n)$ be the $n\times n$ complex general linear group and embed $G_{n-1}=GL(n-1)$ in the top left hand corner of $G$. The standard Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices $B_{n-1}$ of $G_{n-1}$ acts on the flag variety of $G$ with finitely many orbits. In this paper, we show that each $B_{n-1}$-orbit is the intersection of orbits of two Borel subgroups of $G$ acting on the flag variety of $G$. This allows us to give a new combinatorial description of the $B_{n-1}$-orbits by associating to each orbit a pair of Weyl group elements. The closure relations for the $B_{n-1}$-orbits can then be understood in terms of the Bruhat order on the Weyl group, and the Richardson-Springer monoid action on the orbits can be understood in terms of the classical monoid action of the Weyl group on itself. This approach makes the closure relation more transparent than in earlier work of Magyar and the monoid action significantly more computable than in our earlier papers, and also allows us to obtain new information about the orbits including a simple formula for the dimension of an orbit.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory of General Linear Supergroups in Characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop representation theory of general linear groups in the category $\text{Ver}_4^+$, the simplest tensor category which is not Frobenius exact. Since $\text{Ver}_4^+$ is a reduction of the category of supervector spaces to characteristic $2$ (by a result of Venkatesh, arXiv:1507.05142), these groups may be viewed as general linear supergroups in characteristic $2$. More precisely, every object in $\text{Ver}_4^+$ has the form $m\mathbf{1}+nP$ where $P$ is the indecomposable projective, and $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ is the reduction to characteristic $2$ of $\text{GL}(m+n|n)$. We explicitly describe the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(P)$ and then use this description to classify the irreducible representations of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ for general $m,n$. We also define some subgroups of $\text{GL}(m\mathbf{1}+nP)$ and classify their irreducible representations. Finally, we conjecture a Steinberg tensor product theorem for $\text{Ver}_4^+$ involving the square of the Frobenius map.</description>

      <title>An infinite-rank Lie algebra associated to SL$(2,\mathbb R)$ and SL$(2,\mathbb R)/U(1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a generalised notion of Kac-Moody algebras using smooth maps from the non-compact manifolds ${\cal M}=$SL$(2,\mathbb R)$ and ${\cal M}=$ SL$(2,\mathbb R)/U(1)$ to a finite-dimensional simple Lie group $G$. This construction is achieved through two equivalent ways: by means of the Plancherel Theorem and by identifying a Hilbert basis within $L^2(\mathcal{M})$. We analyse the existence of central extensions and identify those in duality with Hermitean operators on $\cal M$. By inspecting the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$, we derive the Lie brackets characterising the corresponding generalised Kac-Moody algebras. The root structure of these algebras is identified, and it is shown that an infinite number of simultaneously commuting operators can be defined. Furthermore, we briefly touch upon applications of these algebras within the realm of supergravity, particularly in scenarios where the scalar fields coordinatize the non-compact manifold $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})/U(1)$.</description>

      <title>Matched pairs and Yetter-Drinfeld braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is proven that a matched pair of actions on a Hopf algebra $H$ is equivalent to the datum of a Yetter-Drinfeld brace, which is a novel structure generalising Hopf braces. This improves a theorem by Angiono, Galindo and Vendramin, originally stated for cocommutative Hopf braces. These Yetter-Drinfeld braces produce Hopf algebras in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over $H$, through an operation that generalises Majid's transmutation. A characterisation of Yetter-Drinfeld braces via 1-cocycles, in analogy to the one for Hopf braces, is given.
  Every coquasitriangular Hopf algebra $H$ will be seen to yield a Yetter-Drinfeld brace, where the additional structure on $H$ is given by the transmutation. We compute explicit examples of Yetter-Drinfeld braces on the Sweedler's Hopf algebra, on the algebras $E(n)$, on $\mathrm{SL}_{q}(2)$, and an example in the class of Suzuki algebras.</description>

      <title>Matrix units in the simple components of rational group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the rational group algebra $\mathbb{Q}G$ of a finite group $G$, we provide an effective method to compute a complete set of matrix units and, in particular, primitive orthogonal idempotents in a simple component of $\mathbb{Q}G$, which is realized by a generalized strongly monomial character and has a prime Schur index. We also provide some classes of groups $G$ where this method can be successfully applied. The application of the method developed is also illustrated with detailed computations.</description>

      <title>Heaps, crystals, and preprojective algebra modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a simply-laced semisimple Lie algebra. We study the crystal $ B(n\lambda)$, were $\lambda$ is a dominant minuscule weight and $n$ is a natural number. On one hand, $B(n\lambda)$ can be realized combinatorially by height $n$ reverse plane partitions on a heap associated to $\lambda$. On the other hand, we use this heap to define a module over the preprojective algebra of the underlying Dynkin quiver. Using the work of Saito and Savage-Tingley, we realize $B(n\lambda)$ via irreducible components of the quiver Grassmannian of $n$ copies of this module. In this paper, we describe an explicit bijection between these two models for $B(n\lambda)$ and prove that our bijection yields an isomorphism of crystals. Our main geometric tool is Nakajima's tensor product quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>Duality for generalized Gan-Gross-Prasad relevant pairs for $p$-adic $\mathrm{GL}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to formulate a notion, called a generalized GGP relevant pair, governing the quotient branching law for $p$-adic general linear groups. Such notion relies on a commutation relation between derivatives (from Jacquet functors) and integrals (from parabolic inductions), for which we provide both representation-theoretic and combinatorial perspectives. Our main result proves a duality on those relevant pairs, which is compatible with a dual restriction in branching law.</description>

      <title>Companion points and locally analytic socle conjecture for Steinberg case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will modify the Breuil-Hellmann-Schraen's (more generally, resp.,Breuil-Ding's) local model for the trianguline variety (resp.,Bernstein paraboline variety) to certain semistable (resp., potentially semistable) non-crystalline point with regular Hodge-Tate weights. Then we deduce several local-global compatibility results, including a classicality result, and the existence of expected companion points on the (definite) eigenvariety and locally analytic socle conjecture for certain semistable non-crystalline Galois representations (in other words, the so-called Steinberg case), under some wild hypothesis on on trianguline variety and the usual Taylor-Wiles assumptions.</description>

      <title>Modified double brackets and a conjecture of S. Arthamonov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Around 20 years ago, M. Van den Bergh introduced double Poisson brackets as operations on associative algebras inducing Poisson brackets under the representation functor. Weaker versions of these operations, called modified double Poisson brackets, were later introduced by S. Arthamonov in order to induce a Poisson bracket on moduli spaces of representations of the corresponding associative algebras. Moreover, he defined two operations that he conjectured to be modified double Poisson brackets. The first case of this conjecture was recently proved by M. Goncharov and V. Gubarev motivated by the theory of Rota-Baxter operators of nonzero weight. We settle the conjecture by realising the second case as part of a new family of modified double Poisson brackets.</description>
