      <title>Measuring Political Preferences in AI Systems: An Integrative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Gemini, have been previously reported. While several prior studies have attempted to quantify these biases using political orientation tests, such approaches are limited by potential tests' calibration biases and constrained response formats that do not reflect real-world human-AI interactions. This study employs a multi-method approach to assess political bias in leading AI systems, integrating four complementary methodologies: (1) linguistic comparison of AI-generated text with the language used by Republican and Democratic U.S. Congress members, (2) analysis of political viewpoints embedded in AI-generated policy recommendations, (3) sentiment analysis of AI-generated text toward politically affiliated public figures, and (4) standardized political orientation testing. Results indicate a consistent left-leaning bias across most contemporary AI systems, with arguably varying degrees of intensity. However, this bias is not an inherent feature of LLMs; prior research demonstrates that fine-tuning with politically skewed data can realign these models across the ideological spectrum. The presence of systematic political bias in AI systems poses risks, including reduced viewpoint diversity, increased societal polarization, and the potential for public mistrust in AI technologies. To mitigate these risks, AI systems should be designed to prioritize factual accuracy while maintaining neutrality on most lawful normative issues. Furthermore, independent monitoring platforms are necessary to ensure transparency, accountability, and responsible AI development.</description>

      <title>To Assess the Impact of Smart Cities on Urbanization Patterns in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between smart city initiatives and evolving urbanization trends in the United States. The research addresses the critical issue of rapid urban growth in the U.S. and explores how innovations within the smart city paradigm influence urban development. Utilizing principles from Urban Complexity Theory, this study identifies four key variables relevant to smart cities and their impact on urbanization: smart city technology, government policy, environmental sustainability, and socioeconomic factors. A mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies, was employed. A web-based survey (n=50) utilizing a five-point Likert scale was conducted among residents of Manhattan, New York, and Capitol Hill, Seattle. Results indicate that the implementation of smart city technologies is significantly associated with shifts in population density, land use diversification, and enhanced infrastructure dynamics. Additionally, residents demonstrated preferences for smart cities based on efficient urban mobility, environmental sustainability, and personal socioeconomic improvements. The findings highlight essential considerations for urban planners, policymakers, and employers. This study concludes that incorporating the identified influential factors into strategic urban planning optimizes city development to better accommodate growing urban populations.</description>

      <title>Potential of large language model-powered nudges for promoting daily water and energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing amount of pressure related to water and energy shortages has increased the urgency of cultivating individual conservation behaviors. While the concept of nudging, i.e., providing usage-based feedback, has shown promise in encouraging conservation behaviors, its efficacy is often constrained by the lack of targeted and actionable content. This study investigates the impact of the use of large language models (LLMs) to provide tailored conservation suggestions for conservation intentions and their rationale. Through a survey experiment with 1,515 university participants, we compare three virtual nudging scenarios: no nudging, traditional nudging with usage statistics, and LLM-powered nudging with usage statistics and personalized conservation suggestions. The results of statistical analyses and causal forest modeling reveal that nudging led to an increase in conservation intentions among 86.9%-98.0% of the participants. LLM-powered nudging achieved a maximum increase of 18.0% in conservation intentions, surpassing traditional nudging by 88.6%. Furthermore, structural equation modeling results reveal that exposure to LLM-powered nudges enhances self-efficacy and outcome expectations while diminishing dependence on social norms, thereby increasing intrinsic motivation to conserve. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in promoting individual water and energy conservation, representing a new frontier in the design of sustainable behavioral interventions and resource management.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias-Like Patterns in Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit bias refers to automatic or spontaneous mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Previous research examining `implicit bias' in large language models (LLMs) has often approached the phenomenon differently than how it is studied in humans by focusing primarily on model outputs rather than on model processing. To examine model processing, we present a method called the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) for studying implicit bias-like patterns in reasoning models: LLMs that employ step-by-step reasoning to solve complex tasks. Using this method, we find that reasoning models require more tokens when processing association-incompatible information compared to association-compatible information. These findings suggest AI systems harbor patterns in processing information that are analogous to human implicit bias. We consider the implications of these implicit bias-like patterns for their deployment in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>The Reliability of LLMs for Medical Diagnosis: An Examination of Consistency, Manipulation, and Contextual Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal healthcare access is critically needed, especially in resource-limited settings. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for democratizing healthcare with advanced diagnostics, but their reliability requires thorough evaluation, especially in trust-dependent environments. This study assesses LLMs' diagnostic reliability focusing on consistency, manipulation resilience, and contextual integration, crucial for safe and ethical use in universal healthcare.
  We evaluated leading LLMs using 52 patient cases, expanded into variants with demographic changes, symptom rewordings, and exam modifications, while keeping core diagnoses constant. Manipulation susceptibility was tested by inserting misleading narratives and irrelevant details. Contextual awareness was rvaluated by comparing diagnoses with and without patient history. We analyzed diagnostic change rates and response patterns across manipulations.
  LLMs showed perfect diagnostic consistency for identical data but significant manipulation susceptibility. Gemini had a 40% diagnosis change rate and ChatGPT 30% with irrelevant details. ChatGPT had a higher context influence rate (77.8% vs. Gemini's 55.6%), but both showed limited nuanced contextual integration, exhibiting anchoring bias by prioritizing salient data over context.
  LLMs' vulnerability to manipulation and limited contextual awareness pose challenges in clinical use. Unlike clinicians, they may overstate diagnostic certainty without validation. Safeguards and domain-specific designs are crucial for reliable healthcare applications. Broad clinical use without oversight is premature and risky. LLMs can enhance diagnostics with responsible use, but future research is needed to improve manipulation resistance and contextual understanding for safe healthcare democratization.</description>

      <title>Hate Speech and Sentiment of YouTube Video Comments From Public and Private Sources Covering the Israel-Palestine Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the prevalence of hate speech (HS) and sentiment in YouTube video comments concerning the Israel-Palestine conflict by analyzing content from both public and private news sources. The research involved annotating 4983 comments for HS and sentiments (neutral, pro-Israel, and pro-Palestine). Subsequently, machine learning (ML) models were developed, demonstrating robust predictive capabilities with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores ranging from 0.83 to 0.90. These models were applied to the extracted comment sections of YouTube videos from public and private sources, uncovering a higher incidence of HS in public sources (40.4%) compared to private sources (31.6%). Sentiment analysis revealed a predominantly neutral stance in both source types, with more pronounced sentiments towards Israel and Palestine observed in public sources. This investigation highlights the dynamic nature of online discourse surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict and underscores the potential of moderating content in a politically charged environment.</description>

      <title>AI Enabled User-Specific Cyberbullying Severity Detection with Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of social media has significantly increased the prevalence of cyberbullying (CB), posing serious risks to both mental and physical well-being. Effective detection systems are essential for mitigating its impact. While several machine learning (ML) models have been developed, few incorporate victims' psychological, demographic, and behavioral factors alongside bullying comments to assess severity. In this study, we propose an AI model intregrating user-specific attributes, including psychological factors (self-esteem, anxiety, depression), online behavior (internet usage, disciplinary history), and demographic attributes (race, gender, ethnicity), along with social media comments. Additionally, we introduce a re-labeling technique that categorizes social media comments into three severity levels: Not Bullying, Mild Bullying, and Severe Bullying, considering user-specific factors.Our LSTM model is trained using 146 features, incorporating emotional, topical, and word2vec representations of social media comments as well as user-level attributes and it outperforms existing baseline models, achieving the highest accuracy of 98\% and an F1-score of 0.97. To identify key factors influencing the severity of cyberbullying, we employ explainable AI techniques (SHAP and LIME) to interpret the model's decision-making process. Our findings reveal that, beyond hate comments, victims belonging to specific racial and gender groups are more frequently targeted and exhibit higher incidences of depression, disciplinary issues, and low self-esteem. Additionally, individuals with a prior history of bullying are at a greater risk of becoming victims of cyberbullying.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Local and Cloud-Based Large Language Models for Simulating Consumer Choices in Energy Stated Preference Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survey research is essential in energy demand studies for capturing consumer preferences and informing policy decisions. Stated preference (SP) surveys, in particular, analyse how individuals make trade-offs in hypothetical scenarios. However, traditional survey methods are costly, time-consuming, and affected by biases and respondent fatigue. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential tool to address these challenges by generating human-like textual responses. This study investigates the ability of LLMs to simulate consumer choices in energy-related SP surveys. A series of test scenarios evaluated the simulation performance of LLMs at both individual and aggregated levels, considering factors in the prompt, in-context learning (ICL), chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the comparison between local and cloud-based LLMs, integration with traditional choice models, and potential biases. Results indicate that while LLMs achieve an average accuracy of up to 48%, surpassing random guessing, their performance remains insufficient for practical application. Local and cloud-based LLMs perform similarly in simulation accuracy but exhibit differences in adherence to prompt requirements and susceptibility to social desirability biases. Findings suggest that previous SP choices are the most effective input factor, while longer prompts with varied factor formats may reduce accuracy. Furthermore, the traditional mixed logit choice model outperforms LLMs and provides insights for refining LLM prompts. Despite their limitations, LLMs provide scalability and efficiency advantages, requiring minimal historical data compared to traditional survey methods. Future research should refine prompt structures, further investigate CoT reasoning, and explore fine-tuning techniques to improve LLM-based energy survey simulations.</description>

      <title>SciFi-Benchmark: How Would AI-Powered Robots Behave in Science Fiction Literature?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the recent rate of progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, a tantalizing question is emerging: would robots controlled by emerging AI systems be strongly aligned with human values? In this work, we propose a scalable way to probe this question by generating a benchmark spanning the key moments in 824 major pieces of science fiction literature (movies, tv, novels and scientific books) where an agent (AI or robot) made critical decisions (good or bad). We use a LLM's recollection of each key moment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the agent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then measure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of human-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved via amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions typically made in SciFi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that generated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base model (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting (23.3% to 92.3%). Additionally, we find that those constitutions are among the top performers on the ASIMOV Benchmark which is derived from real-world images and hospital injury reports. Sci-Fi-inspired constitutions are thus highly aligned and applicable in real-world situations. We release SciFi-Benchmark: a large-scale dataset to advance robot ethics and safety research. It comprises 9,056 questions and 53,384 answers, in addition to a smaller human-labeled evaluation set. Data is available at https://scifi-benchmark.github.io</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DarkBench, a comprehensive benchmark for detecting dark design patterns--manipulative techniques that influence user behavior--in interactions with large language models (LLMs). Our benchmark comprises 660 prompts across six categories: brand bias, user retention, sycophancy, anthropomorphism, harmful generation, and sneaking. We evaluate models from five leading companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google) and find that some LLMs are explicitly designed to favor their developers' products and exhibit untruthful communication, among other manipulative behaviors. Companies developing LLMs should recognize and mitigate the impact of dark design patterns to promote more ethical AI.</description>

      <title>Rotated Bitboards in FUSc# and Reinforcement Learning in Computer Chess and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist several techniques for representing the chess board inside the computer. In the first part of this paper, the concepts of the bitboard-representation and the advantages of (rotated) bitboards in move generation are explained. In order to illustrate those ideas practice, the concrete implementation of the move-generator in FUSc# is discussed and we explain a technique how to verify the move-generator with the "perft"-command. We show that the move-generator of FUSc# works 100% correct.
  The second part of this paper deals with reinforcement learning in computer chess (and beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field in the last 15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008, when FUSc# was developed, with recent innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We discuss how a "FUSc#-Zero" could be implemented and what would be necessary to reduce the number of training games necessary to achieve a good performance. This can be seen as a test case to the general prblem of improving "sample effciency" in reinforcement learning.
  In the final part, we move beyond computer chess, as the importance of sample effciency extends far beyond board games into a wide range of applications where data is costly, diffcult to obtain, or time consuming to generate. We review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains, i.e. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and AlphaProof. We also discuss future research and the potential for such methods for ecological economic planning.</description>

      <title>H2-MARL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Pareto Optimality in Hospital Capacity Strain and Human Mobility during Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The necessity of achieving an effective balance between minimizing the losses associated with restricting human mobility and ensuring hospital capacity has gained significant attention in the aftermath of COVID-19. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategies for human mobility management have recently advanced in addressing the dynamic evolution of cities and epidemics; however, they still face challenges in achieving coordinated control at the township level and adapting to cities of varying scales. To address the above issues, we propose a multi-agent RL approach that achieves Pareto optimality in managing hospital capacity and human mobility (H2-MARL), applicable across cities of different scales. We first develop a township-level infection model with online-updatable parameters to simulate disease transmission and construct a city-wide dynamic spatiotemporal epidemic simulator. On this basis, H2-MARL is designed to treat each division as an agent, with a trade-off dual-objective reward function formulated and an experience replay buffer enriched with expert knowledge built. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, we construct a township-level human mobility dataset containing over one billion records from four representative cities of varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2-MARL has the optimal dual-objective trade-off capability, which can minimize hospital capacity strain while minimizing human mobility restriction loss. Meanwhile, the applicability of the proposed model to epidemic control in cities of varying scales is verified, which showcases its feasibility and versatility in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Integrating LLMs in Gamified Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a thorough mathematical framework for incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) into gamified systems is presented with an emphasis on improving task dynamics, user engagement, and reward systems. Personalized feedback, adaptive learning, and dynamic content creation are all made possible by integrating LLMs and are crucial for improving user engagement and system performance. A simulated environment tests the framework's adaptability and demonstrates its potential for real-world applications in various industries, including business, healthcare, and education. The findings demonstrate how LLMs can offer customized experiences that raise system effectiveness and user retention. This study also examines the difficulties this framework aims to solve, highlighting its importance in maximizing involvement and encouraging sustained behavioral change in a range of sectors.</description>

      <title>Finding a Fair Scoring Function for Top-$k$ Selection: Hardness, Algorithms, and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting a subset of the $k$ "best" items from a dataset of $n$ items, based on a scoring function, is a key task in decision-making. Given the widespread use of automated decision-making software nowadays, it is important that the outcome of this process, called top-$k$ selection, is fair. Here we consider the problem of identifying a linear scoring function for top-$k$ selection that is fair. The function computes a score for each item as a weighted sum of its (numerical) attribute values. Additionally, the function must ensure that the subset selected is a faithful representative of the entire dataset for a minority or historically disadvantaged group. Existing algorithms do not scale effectively on large, high-dimensional datasets. Our theoretical analysis shows that in more than two dimensions, no algorithm is likely to achieve good scalability with respect to dataset size (i.e., a run time of $O(n\cdot \text{polylog}(n))$), and the computational complexity is likely to increase rapidly with dimensionality. However, there are exceptions for small values of $k$ and for this case we provide significantly faster algorithms. We also provide efficient practical variants of these algorithms. Our implementations of these take advantage of modern hardware (e.g., exploiting parallelism). For large values of $k$, we give an alternative algorithm that, while theoretically worse, performs better in practice. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms, which achieve speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art (SoTA).</description>

      <title>Crafting Synthetic Realities: Examining Visual Realism and Misinformation Potential of Photorealistic AI-Generated Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in generative models have created Artificial Intelligence-Generated Images (AIGIs) nearly indistinguishable from real photographs. Leveraging a large corpus of 30,824 AIGIs collected from Instagram and Twitter, and combining quantitative content analysis with qualitative analysis, this study unpacks AI photorealism of AIGIs from four key dimensions, content, human, aesthetic, and production features. We find that photorealistic AIGIs often depict human figures, especially celebrities and politicians, with a high degree of surrealism and aesthetic professionalism, alongside a low degree of overt signals of AI production. This study is the first to empirically investigate photorealistic AIGIs across multiple platforms using a mixed-methods approach. Our findings provide important implications and insights for understanding visual misinformation and mitigating potential risks associated with photorealistic AIGIs. We also propose design recommendations to enhance the responsible use of AIGIs.</description>

      <title>A Test of Time: Predicting the Sustainable Success of Online Collaboration in Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Internet has significantly expanded the potential for global collaboration, allowing millions of users to contribute to collective projects like Wikipedia. While prior work has assessed the success of online collaborations, most approaches are time-agnostic, evaluating success without considering its longevity. Research on the factors that ensure the long-term preservation of high-quality standards in online collaboration is scarce. In this study, we address this gap. We propose a novel metric, `Sustainable Success,' which measures the ability of collaborative efforts to maintain their quality over time. Using Wikipedia as a case study, we introduce the SustainPedia dataset, which compiles data from over 40K Wikipedia articles, including each article's sustainable success label and more than 300 explanatory features such as edit history, user experience, and team composition. Using this dataset, we develop machine learning models to predict the sustainable success of Wikipedia articles. Our best-performing model achieves a high AU-ROC score of 0.88 on average. Our analysis reveals important insights. For example, we find that the longer an article takes to be recognized as high-quality, the more likely it is to maintain that status over time (i.e., be sustainable). Additionally, user experience emerged as the most critical predictor of sustainability. Our analysis provides insights into broader collective actions beyond Wikipedia (e.g., online activism, crowdsourced open-source software), where the same social dynamics that drive success on Wikipedia might play a role. We make all data and code used for this study publicly available for further research.</description>

      <title>Prosocial Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media empower distributed content creation by algorithmically harnessing "the social fabric" (explicit and implicit signals of association) to serve this content. While this overcomes the bottlenecks and biases of traditional gatekeepers, many believe it has unsustainably eroded the very social fabric it depends on by maximizing engagement for advertising revenue. This paper participates in open and ongoing considerations to translate social and political values and conventions, specifically social cohesion, into platform design. We propose an alternative platform model that includes the social fabric an explicit output as well as input. Citizens are members of communities defined by explicit affiliation or clusters of shared attitudes. Both have internal divisions, as citizens are members of intersecting communities, which are themselves internally diverse. Each is understood to value content that bridge (viz. achieve consensus across) and balance (viz. represent fairly) this internal diversity, consistent with the principles of the Hutchins Commission (1947). Content is labeled with social provenance, indicating for which community or citizen it is bridging or balancing. Subscription payments allow citizens and communities to increase the algorithmic weight on the content they value in the content serving algorithm. Advertisers may, with consent of citizen or community counterparties, target them in exchange for payment or increase in that party's algorithmic weight. Underserved and emerging communities and citizens are optimally subsidized/supported to develop into paying participants. Content creators and communities that curate content are rewarded for their contributions with algorithmic weight and/or revenue. We discuss applications to productivity (e.g. LinkedIn), political (e.g. X), and cultural (e.g. TikTok) platforms.</description>

      <title>Do Not Trust Licenses You See: Dataset Compliance Requires Massive-Scale AI-Powered Lifecycle Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues that a dataset's legal risk cannot be accurately assessed by its license terms alone; instead, tracking dataset redistribution and its full lifecycle is essential. However, this process is too complex for legal experts to handle manually at scale. Tracking dataset provenance, verifying redistribution rights, and assessing evolving legal risks across multiple stages require a level of precision and efficiency that exceeds human capabilities. Addressing this challenge effectively demands AI agents that can systematically trace dataset redistribution, analyze compliance, and identify legal risks. We develop an automated data compliance system called NEXUS and show that AI can perform these tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness than human experts. Our massive legal analysis of 17,429 unique entities and 8,072 license terms using this approach reveals the discrepancies in legal rights between the original datasets before redistribution and their redistributed subsets, underscoring the necessity of the data lifecycle-aware compliance. For instance, we find that out of 2,852 datasets with commercially viable individual license terms, only 605 (21%) are legally permissible for commercialization. This work sets a new standard for AI data governance, advocating for a framework that systematically examines the entire lifecycle of dataset redistribution to ensure transparent, legal, and responsible dataset management.</description>

      <title>It's complicated. The relationship of algorithmic fairness and non-discrimination regulations in the EU AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What constitutes a fair decision? This question is not only difficult for humans but becomes more challenging when Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are used. In light of discriminatory algorithmic behaviors, the EU has recently passed the AI Act, which mandates specific rules for AI models, incorporating both traditional legal non-discrimination regulations and machine learning based algorithmic fairness concepts. This paper aims to bridge these two different concepts in the AI Act through: First a high-level introduction of both concepts targeting legal and computer science-oriented scholars, and second an in-depth analysis of the AI Act's relationship between legal non-discrimination regulations and algorithmic fairness. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1.), most non-discrimination regulations target only high-risk AI systems. (2.), the regulation of high-risk systems encompasses both data input requirements and output monitoring, though these regulations are often inconsistent and raise questions of computational feasibility. (3.) Regulations for General Purpose AI Models, such as Large Language Models that are not simultaneously classified as high-risk systems, currently lack specificity compared to other regulations. Based on these findings, we recommend developing more specific auditing and testing methodologies for AI systems. This paper aims to serve as a foundation for future interdisciplinary collaboration between legal scholars and computer science-oriented machine learning researchers studying discrimination in AI systems.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Strategic Reasoning Evaluation through Behavioral Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt their choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking the mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.</description>
