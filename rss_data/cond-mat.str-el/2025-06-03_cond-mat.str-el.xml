      <title>Holon metal, charge-density-wave and chiral superconductor from doping fractional Chern insulator and SU(3)$_1$ chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiment observed a superconductor proximate to the $\nu_h=-\frac{2}{3}=-1+\frac{1}{3}$ fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator in twisted MoTe$_2$. One critical question is whether the normal state is a Fermi liquid with large Fermi surface, or a strongly correlated metallic state with small carrier density. In this work we develop a theory of possible phases from doping the $\nu=-\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI). We also point out that the problem is dual to doping a SU(3)$_1$ chiral spin liquid(CSL) if we assume that the spin gap is finite. For both problems, a natural phase upon doping is a holon metal with three small Fermi pockets. The pocket is formed by a spinless charge $-e$ holon in the doped CSL case and a charge $-e/3$ fractionalized hole in the doped FCI case. The holon metal is likely unstable to pairing due to gauge field fluctuations, leading to a charge density wave (CDW) metal, but may be stabilized by magnetic field and shows an unusual quantum oscillation period. Two different chiral superconductors are possible, emerging from the CDW metal phase or directly from the holon metal. We note that a superconductor directly from anyon gas seems unlikely if the cheapest anyon is the elementary one with $e/3$ charge.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-deformed toric codes and the quantum dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent introduction of a $U(1)$-symmetric toric code model, we investigate symmetry-based deformations of topological order by systematically deconstructing the Gauss-law-enforcing star terms of the toric code (TC) Hamiltonian. This "term-dropping" protocol introduces global symmetries that go beyond the alternative framework of "ungauging" topological order in symmetry-deformed models and gives rise to models such as the $U(1)$TC or $XY$TC. These models inherit (emergent) subsystem symmetries (from the original 1-form symmetry of the TC) that can give rise to (subextensive) ground-state degeneracies, which can still be organized by the eigenvalues of Wilson loop operators. However, we demonstrate that these models do not support topological or fracton order (as has been conjectured in the literature) due to the loss of (emergent) gauge symmetry. An extreme deformation of the TC is the quantum dimer model (QDM), which we discuss along the family of symmetry-deformed models from the perspective of subsystem symmetries, sublattice modulation, and quantum order-by-disorder mechanisms resulting in rich phase diagrams. For the QDM, this allows us to identify an emergent SO(2) symmetry for what appears to be a gapless ground state (by numerical standards) that is unstable to the formation of a plaquette valence bond solid upon sublattice modulation.</description>

      <title>Absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of determinantal anzatzes for neural network wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network wave functions have shown promise as a way to achieve high accuracy on the many-body quantum problem. These wave functions most commonly use a determinant or sum of determinants to antisymmetrize many-body orbitals which are described by a neural network. In previous literature, the spin has been treated as a non-dynamical variable, with each electron assigned a fixed spin label of up or down. Such a treatment is allowed for spin-independent operators; however, it cannot be applied to spin-dependent problems, such as Hamiltonians containing spin-orbit interactions. We provide an extension of neural networks to fully spinor wave functions, which can be applied to spin-dependent problems. We also show that for spin-independent Hamiltonians, a strict upper bound property is obeyed between a traditional Hartree-Fock like determinant, full spinor wave function, and the so-called full determinant wave function of Pfau et al. The relationship between a spinor wave function and the full determinant arises because the full determinant wave function is the spinor wave function projected onto a fixed spin, after which antisymmetry is implicitly restored in the spin-independent case. For spin-dependent Hamiltonians, the full determinant wave function is not applicable, because it is not antisymmetric. Numerical experiments on the H$_3$ molecule and two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas confirm the bounds.</description>

      <title>1D Transition Metal Oxide Chains as a Challenging Model for Ab Initio Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing highly simplified models of strongly correlated electronic systems that challenge {\it ab initio} calculations can serve as a valuable testing ground to improve these methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$, and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard $U$ parameter for DFT+$U$ is determined using the linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima -- primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d-orbitals -- leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+U, and Hartree-Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+$U$ and PBE. We analyze the electronic band structures and find that while the PBE approximation often predicts metallic or half-metallic ground states for the ferromagnetic (FM) state, DFT+$U$ approach successfully opens band gaps, correctly predicting insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+$U$ and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+$U$, suggesting that the Hubbard $U$ parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+$U$ and PBE methods.</description>

      <title>A higher dimensional generalization of the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an exactly solvable model of a four-dimensional Kitaev spin liquid. The lattice structure is orthorhombic and each unit-cell contains six sublattice degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that the Fermi surface of the model is made up of two-dimensional surfaces. Additionally, we evaluate the energy cost of creating visons using scattering theory. The positive bond-flip energy suggests that the system's ground state is flux-free, similar to the two-dimensional Kitaev honeycomb model. Our model sheds light on the realization of high-dimensional fractionalization. high-dimensional fractionalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed remarkable role of a supercell consisting $4\times4$ CuO$_2$ unit cells in the emergence of local nematic state and preformed local Cooper pairs and phase coherent cuprate superconductivity. By employing the numerically exact determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we mimic the effects of experimental Ca vacancy by an external local potential to investigate the charge and spectral properties of the system hosting two doped holes. The model numerically support the role of the $4\times4$ supercell as the building block of hole doped cuprates via the hole density distribution and local spectra around the local potential. Our results might provide a theoretical support on the experimental observations and a platform for investigating local charge order and local Cooper pairs on the $4\times4$ supercell as the plausible route to understanding unconventional cuprate superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Direct probe of magnetic field effects on phonons by ultrasound propagation in a quasi-two-dimensional honeycomb magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phonon behavior of a Co-based honeycomb frustrated magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ under magnetic field applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane. The temperature and field dependence of the sound velocity and sound attenuation unveil prominent spin-lattice coupling in this material, promoting ultrasound as a sensitive probe for magnetic properties. An out-of-plane ferrimagnetic order is determined below the N\'eel temperature $T_N=27$~K. A comprehensive analysis of our data further provides strong evidence for a triple-Q ground state of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. Furthermore, the ultrasound data underscore that the field impact on the thermal conductivity as recently reported is of pure phononic origin.</description>

      <title>Missing link between the 2D Quantum Hall problem and 1D quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses a connection between two important classes of materials, namely quasicrystals and topological insulators as exemplified by the Quantum Hall problem. It has been remarked that the quasicrystal ``inherits" topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall model. We show this explicitly by introducing the Fibonacci-Hall model as a link between a 1D quasicrystal and the magnetic problems. We show here how Chern numbers for bands in periodic approximants of quasicrystals can be computed, along with gap labels. The Chern numbers are thus seen as a consequence of a flux parameter $\phi^S$ induced by the geometry of winding in 2D space of the quasicrystal. We show the existence of lines of Lifshitz transitions in the phase space of the model. These are marked by change of Chern number and disappearance of edge states. The proposed extrapolation method can be generalized to higher dimensional 2D and 3D quasicrystals, where higher order Chern numbers could be computed, and related to experimentally measurable transport quantities.</description>

      <title>Analogs of deconfined quantum criticality for non-invertible symmetry breaking in 1d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to exotic phenomena such as coexistence of order and disorder. Here we explore second-order phase transitions in 1d spin chains between two phases that correspond to distinct patterns of non-invertible symmetry breaking. The critical point shares several features with well-understood examples of deconfined quantum critical points, such as enlarged symmetry and identical exponents for the two order parameters participating in the transition. Interestingly, such deconfined transitions involving non-invertible symmetries allow one to construct a whole family of similar critical points by gauging spin-flip symmetries. By employing gauging and bosonization, we characterize the phase diagram of our model in the vicinity of the critical point. We also explore proximate phases and phase transitions in related models, including a deconfined quantum critical point between invertible order parameters that is enforced by a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Co-3d high- and low-spin states in an Ising spin chain magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of trivalent cobalt oxide compounds are largely influenced by the spin state of the six 3d electrons at each Co site. High-spin Co3+ ions, where orbital angular momentum is only partially quenched, often exhibit significant anisotropy, providing playgrounds for Ising spin systems. However, real-space observations of their orbital states have remained limited. Here, we determine the Co-3d spin and orbital states in an Ising spin chain magnet Ca3Co2O6, where high- and low-spin states alternate along the chain. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and valence electron density (VED) analysis, utilizing the core differential Fourier synthesis (CDFS) method, reveal distinct anisotropic VED distributions around the two Co sites with different symmetries. The VED distribution around the octahedral Co site corresponds to a low-spin state, while the trigonal-prismatic Co site exhibits anisotropic VED that cannot be explained by the crystal electric field (CEF) alone. This anisotropy is better reproduced by a model incorporating CEF, spin-orbit coupling, and on-site 3d-4p orbital hybridization, consistent with a high-spin state exhibiting Ising magnetism. These results provide deeper insight into Co-3d states and highlight the CDFS method's utility in exploring interactions in quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EDIpack is a flexible, high-performance numerical library using Lanczos-based exact diagonalization to solve generic quantum impurity problems, such as those introduced in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to describe extended strongly correlated materials. The library efficiently solves impurity problems allowing for different broken-symmetry solutions, including superconductivity and featuring local spin-orbit coupling and/or electron-phonon coupling. The modular architecture of the software not only provides Fortran APIs but also includes bindings to C/C++, interfaces with Python and Julia or with TRIQS and W2Dynamics research platforms, thus ensuring unprecedented level of inter-operability. The outlook includes further extensions to study quantum materials and cold atoms quantum simulators, as well as quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced coherence and layer-selective charge order in a trilayer cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trilayer cuprates hold the record for the highest superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\text{c}}$), yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES), we uncover a striking interplay between charge order, superconducting gap magnitude, and quasiparticle coherence in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223). This constitutes ARPES-based evidence of charge order on the inner CuO$_2$ plane, as confirmed via resonant x-ray scattering (RXS); in addition, the same inner plane hosts a superconducting gap significantly larger than that of the overdoped outer planes, firmly establishing it as underdoped. Unexpectedly, despite its underdoped nature, the inner plane also exhibits an exceptional degree of quasiparticle coherence; suppressing charge-order fluctuations further enhances this, making it comparable to that of the overdoped outer planes at elevated electronic temperatures. These findings, supported by complementary three-layer single-band Hubbard calculations, reveal a unique interlayer mechanism in which both pairing strength and phase coherence are optimized when interfacing planes with distinct hole concentrations, providing new microscopic insight into the record $T_{\text{c}}$ of Bi2223.</description>

      <title>Eta-pairing states in Hubbard models with bond-charge interactions on general graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Hubbard models with bond-charge interactions on general graphs. For a Hamiltonian \(H\) of such a model, we provide the condition on its parameters under which the \(\eta\)-pairing method can be employed to construct its exact eigenstates. We arrive at this condition by finding that the requirement for the \(\eta\)-pairing state \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\) to be an eigenstate of \(H\) is identical to the requirement for it to be an eigenstate of a Hubbard-type Hamiltonian \(H_m\). When the condition for \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\) to be an eigenstate of the Hubbard-type Hamiltonian \(H_m\) is satisfied, we demonstrate that there are additional states, distinct from \((\eta^\dagger)^N |0\rangle\), which are also exact eigenstates of \(H_m\). Our results enhance the understanding of Hubbard models on general graphs, both with and without bond-charge interactions.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the kagome lattice to improve understanding of ARPES in CoSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic kagome lattices are attracting significant attention as they provide a platform to explore the interplay between topology and magnetism. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) plays a key role in unraveling their electronic structure. However, the analysis is often challenging due to the presence of multiple bands near the Fermi level. Indeed, each orbital generates three bands in a kagome lattice due to its three inequivalent sites, which soon becomes complicated if many orbitals are present. To address this complexity, using ARPES matrix elements can be highly beneficial. First, band symmetry can be determined through selection rules based on light polarization. We emphasize that, in kagome lattices, symmetry is not only determined by the orbital character but also by the relative phase between the three sublattices. Additionally, interference between the three sublattices leads to a strong modulation of ARPES intensity across neighboring Brillouin zones. We show how unfolded band calculations capture these modulations, helping with band identification. We apply these ideas to CoSn, whose simple structure retains the key features of a kagome lattice. Taking advantage of these two effects, we isolate the dispersion of each band and discuss novel correlation effects, selectively renormalizing the bands crossing the Fermi level and shifting the others.</description>

      <title>Realization of broken inversion symmetry in the charge density wave phase in EuAl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EuAl$_4$ exhibits a complex phase diagram, including the development of a charge density wave (CDW) below $T_{CDW} = 145$ K. Below $T_{N}=15.4$ K, a series of antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered phases appear, while non-trivial topological phases, like skyrmion lattices, are stabilized under an applied magnetic field. The symmetries of the variously ordered phases are a major issue concerning the understanding of the stabilization of the ordered phases as well as concerning the interplay between the various types of order. EuAl$_4$ at room temperature has tetragonal symmetry with space group $I4/mmm$. The CDW phase has an incommensurately modulated crystal structure described by the modulation wave vector $\mathbf{q} \approx 0.17\,\mathbf{c}^{*}$. On the basis of various experiments, including elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering, and second-harmonic generation, it has been proposed that the symmetry of the CDW phase of EuAl$_4$ could be centrosymmetric orthorhombic, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic or non-centrosymmetric tetragonal. Here, we report temperature-dependent, single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments that show that the CDW is a transverse CDW with phason disorder, and with non-centrosymmetric symmetry according to the orthorhombic superspace group $F222(0\,0\,\sigma)00s$.Essential for this finding is the availability of a sufficient number of second-order ($2\mathbf{q}$) satellite reflections in the x-ray diffraction data set. The broken inversion symmetry implies that skyrmions might form due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, instead of a more exotic mechanism as it is required for centrosymmetric structures.</description>

      <title>Loop current order on the kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries in kagome materials have unveiled their capacity to harbor exotic quantum states, including intriguing charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Notably, accumulating experimental evidence suggests time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking within the CDW, hinting at the long-pursued loop current order (LCO). Despite extensive research efforts, achieving its model realization and understanding the mechanism through unbiased many-body simulations have remained both elusive and challenging.In this work, we develop a microscopic model for LCO on the spinless kagome lattice with non-local interactions, utilizing unbiased functional renormalization group calculations to explore ordering tendencies across all two-particle scattering channels. At the van Hove filling, we identify sublattice interference to suppress onsite CDW order, leaving LCO, charge bond and nematic CDW state as the main competitors. Remarkably, a $2\times2$ LCO emerges as the many-body ground state over a significant parameter space with strong second nearest-neighbor repulsion, stemming from the unique interplay between sublattice characters and lattice geometry. The resulting electronic model with LCO bears similarities to the Haldane model and culminates in a quantum anomalous Hall state. We also discuss potential experimental implications for kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Neutron diffraction evidence of the 3-dimensional structure of Ba2MnTeO6 and misidentification of the triangular layers within the face-centred cubic lattice"</title>

Abstract: Frustrated magnetism continues to attract significant attention due to its potential to host novel quantum many-body phenomena and associated exotic excitations that transcend existing paradigms. Herein, we present our reply to the comment on our recent thermodynamic and muon spin relaxation studies on a frustrated double perovskite, Ba2MnTeO6 (henceforth BMTO). Previous studies by four independent groups, including our group, suggested a trigonal space group based on single-crystal and polycrystalline samples of BMTO, while the recent comment reports a cubic space group based on polycrystalline samples. We believe that the structure is fairly intricate because of the slight variations between the two space groups, refining the crystal structure of BMTO remains an unresolved problem that needs additional high-resolution XRD and neutron diffraction studies on high-quality single crystals. It is thought, however, that structural assignments will not greatly influence any of the primary findings related to the magnetism and spin dynamics of BMTO. These consist of a magnetic phase transition at around 21 K, the observation of antiferromagnetic magnon excitations exhibiting a gap of 1.4 K beneath the phase transition, the presence of short-range spin correlations well above the antiferromagnetic phase transition, and the persistence of spin dynamics even within the magnetically ordered phase. It is important to note that the magnetization, specific heat, and muon spin relaxation findings that constitute the core of our earlier study are independent; the interpretation of these findings did not rely on any specific space group. Concerning the final allocation of the symmetry of BMTO, a definitive differentiation in certain physical characteristics resulting from the symmetry is still necessary.</description>

      <title>Enhancing van-Hove singularities in SrRuO$_3$ films by vacancy engineerings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat bands, characterized by their localized electronic states and van Hove singularities, provide an ideal platform for exploring many-body physics. However, transition metal oxides hosting flat bands are quite rare. In this study, we investigate the origin of the existing nearly flat bands (NFBs) in SrRuO$_3$ thin films and demonstrate how to increase the number of them through structural modifications. Using a tight-binding model that replicates experimental band structures, we analyze the SrRuO$_3$ monolayer, revealing the origin of its NFBs along the $x$ and $y$ directions. These NFBs arise from destructive interference stabilizing strip-type compact localized states. By introducing periodic Ru-site vacancies, additional NFBs are generated, classified as partial or complete, depending on their Brillouin zone coverage. The compact localized states associated with these NFBs are identified, providing insight into their physical origin. For a 4-layer SrRuO$_3$ multilayer film, we uncover many partial NFBs along the $\Gamma$X and XM directions and reveal the distinct origin of their development. Our findings highlight the potential of engineering flat bands in SrRuO$_3$ films, offering new opportunities for exploring correlated electronic phases and expanding the material platform for flat-band physics.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Hamiltonian Compiler for Hybrid Qubit-Boson Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of the interactions of fermions and bosons -- the fundamental particles of nature -- is essential for modeling complex quantum systems in material science, chemistry and high-energy physics and has been proposed as a promising application of fermion-boson quantum computers, which overcome the overhead encountered in mapping fermions and bosons to qubits. However, compiling the simulation of specific fermion-boson Hamiltonians into the natively available fermion-boson gate set is challenging. In particular, the large local dimension of bosons renders matrix-based compilation methods, as used for qubits and in existing tools such as Bosonic Qiskit or OpenFermion, challenging. We overcome this issue by introducing a novel symbolic compiler based on matrix-free symbolic manipulation of second quantised Hamiltonians, which automates the decomposition of fermion-boson second quantized problems into qubit-boson instruction set architectures. This integration establishes a comprehensive pipeline for simulating quantum systems on emerging qubit-boson and fermion-boson hardware, paving the way for their large-scale usage.</description>

      <title>Resonant interlayer coupling in NbSe$_2$-graphite epitaxial moir{\'e} superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir{\'e} heterostructures, created by stacking two-dimensional (2D) materials together with a finite lattice mismatch or rotational twist, represent a new frontier of designer quantum materials. Typically, however, this requires the painstaking manual assembly of heterostructures formed from exfoliated materials. Here, we observe clear spectroscopic signatures of moir{\'e} lattice formation in epitaxial heterostructures of monolayer (ML) NbSe$_2$ grown on graphite substrates. Our angle-resolved photoemission measurements and theoretical calculations of the resulting electronic structure reveal moir{\'e} replicas of the graphite $\pi$ states forming pairs of interlocking Dirac cones. Interestingly, these intersect the NbSe$_2$ Fermi surface at the $\mathbf{k}$-space locations where NbSe$_2$'s charge-density wave (CDW) gap is maximal in the bulk. This provides a natural route to understand the lack of CDW enhancement for ML-NbSe$_2$/graphene as compared to a more than four-fold enhancement for NbSe$_2$ on insulating support substrates, and opens new prospects for using moir{\'e} engineering for controlling the collective states of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic interactions as a pivotal determinant in stabilizing a novel AgIIAgIIIF5 polymorph with high spin AgIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on theoretical calculations, we introduce a new AgIIAgIIIF5 monoclinic polymorph with a rare high spin AgIII. Our analysis of the experimental xray diffraction data available in the literature reveals that this polymorph was likely prepared in the past in a mixture with the triclinic form of the same compound. Theoretical calculations reproduce very well the lattice parameters of both forms. Calculations suggest that under ambient conditions, the monoclinic form is the more energetically stable phase of Ag2F5. We predict a strong one-dimensional antiferromagnetic superexchange between silver cations of different valences with superexchange constant of minus 207 meV (hybrid functional result). The polymorph with high spin AgIII owes its stability over the one with low spin AgIII, to these magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Robust Charge-Density Wave Correlations in Optimally-Doped YBa2Cu3Oy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-density wave (CDW) order is a key property of high-Tc cuprates, but its boundaries in the phase diagram and potential connections to other phases remain controversial. We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in the prototypical cuprate YBa2Cu3Oy demonstrating that short-range static CDW order remains robust at optimal doping (p=0.165), exhibiting a strength and temperature dependence in the normal state similar to those observed at p=0.11 in the underdoped regime. For an overdoped sample with p=0.184, we detect no static CDW down to T=Tc, though weak CDW order plausibly emerges below Tc. More broadly, we argue that both quenched disorder and competition with superconductivity influence the apparent boundary of the CDW phase, likely causing an underestimation of its intrinsic extent in doping. These findings challenge the view that the CDW phase boundary lies below p*=0.19, widely regarded as the critical doping where the pseudogap phase ends in YBa2Cu3Oy.</description>

      <title>Observation of pseudogap in Cr_{1-x}Y_xN magnetic alloy and its impact on the Seebeck coefficient by ab-initio calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials require high electronic conductivity and low thermal conductivity. CrN has been shown to have low phononic thermal conductivity, making it a potential candidate for thermoelectric applications. In addition, similarities have been observed between YN and ScN suggesting that the CrYN alloy may have interesting thermoelectric properties. As CrYN has not been studied in detail at the level of thermoelectric properties, the first study on CrYN alloy of Seebeck coefficient and zT figure of merit is proposed in this study. For this purpose, cubic special quasirandom structures were constructed at values of x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 in the alloy Cr_{1-x}Y_xN starting from different magnetic structures. After analyzing lattice parameters, Cr magnetic moments, octahedron deformation, second neighbors distribution around metals, density of states and band structures, it was concluded that to obtain high values of Seebeck coefficient and zT, it is necessary the presence of a pseudo gap in both spin channels and it is also necessary that the Fermi level is on a steep decreasing slope of number of states, since due to Motts approximation, the value of this slope is proportional to the Seebeck coefficient. Density of states of all the structures shows a metallic behavior. In structures with x=0.5, the presence of small indirect energy gaps is observed. Although no structure retains the initial magnetic configuration, there is a possible influence of this on the electronic structure. Considerable deformations in octahedra can suppress thermoelectric properties.</description>

Abstract: Topological magnetoelectricity was recently revealed as an emergent topic, which opens a unique route to precisely control magnetoelectric functionality. Here we report the synchronous magnetic-electric-cycle operation of topological magnetoelectric switching in GdMn2O5. Compared with pure magnetic-cycle operation, this topological winding can be accessed in a much broader parameter space, i.e. orientation of magnetic field is not limited to the magic angle and the effect can persist up to the Curie temperature. The fine tuning of free energy landscape is responsible to this topological behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Embedding via Ghost Gutzwiller Approximation for Enhanced Simulations of Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating correlated materials on present-day quantum hardware remains challenging due to limited quantum resources. Quantum embedding methods offer a promising route by reducing computational complexity through the mapping of bulk systems onto effective impurity models, allowing more feasible simulations on pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. This work develops a quantum-classical embedding framework based on the ghost Gutzwiller approximation to enable quantum-enhanced simulations of ground-state properties and spectral functions of correlated electron systems. Circuit complexity is analyzed using an adaptive variational quantum algorithm on a statevector simulator, applied to the infinite-dimensional Hubbard model with increasing ghost mode numbers from 3 to 5, resulting in circuit depths growing from 16 to 104. Noise effects are examined using a realistic error model, revealing significant impact on the spectral weight of the Hubbard bands. To mitigate these effects, the Iceberg quantum error detection code is employed, achieving up to 40% error reduction in simulations. Finally, the accuracy of the density matrix estimation is benchmarked on IBM and Quantinuum quantum hardware, featuring distinct qubit-connectivity and employing multiple levels of error mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>Persistence of charge ordering instability to Coulomb engineering in the excitonic insulator candidate TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TiSe$_2$ has long been considered one of the best candidate materials to host the elusive excitonic insulator (EI) phase. However, a finite coupling to the lattice can generically be expected, while a lack of "smoking-gun" signatures for the importance of the electron-hole interaction in driving the phase transition has rendered it challenging to distinguish the EI from the conventional charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. Here, we demonstrate a new approach, exploiting the susceptibility of excitons to dielectric screening. We combine mechanical exfoliation with molecular-beam epitaxy to fabricate ultra-clean van der Waals heterostructures of monolayer (ML-)TiSe$_2$/graphite and ML-TiSe$_2$/hBN. We observe how the modified substrate screening environment drives a renormalisation of the quasi-particle band gap of the TiSe$_2$ layer, signifying its susceptibility to Coloumb engineering. The temperature-dependent evolution of its electronic structure, however, remains unaffected, indicating that excitons are not required to drive the CDW transition in TiSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Orbital Magnetism in Graphene-based Fractional Chern Insulators</title>

Abstract: Orbital magnetism in graphene originates from correlation-driven spontaneous valley symmetry breaking1-7. It can lead to various anomalous transport phenomena such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects8-11. In general, the in-plane magnetic field B|| primarily couples to the spin degrees of freedom in graphene and has long been presumed to have a negligible effect on orbital magnetism due to the ultra-weak spin-orbit coupling12-18. In this work, we report multiple unconventional orbital magnetic phenomena that are highly sensitive to the B|| field in graphene/hBN superlattices hosting both integer and fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). We observed chirality-switching behaviors of the Chern insulator at moir\'e filling factor {\nu} = 1 under a finite B_par, demonstrating that both the C = +-1 states are permissible ground states at zero perpendicular magnetic field B_per. For the FCI at {\nu} = 2/3, we observed topological phase transitions between two states characterized by Hall resistivity \r{ho}xy = +-3h/2e2 under both B_per and B_par fields. In-plane B|| field can effectively suppress the FCI state at zero B_per field and enhance the FCI state with the opposite chirality, as resolved in Landau fan diagrams. Moreover, we observed rich phase transitions at 1 &lt; {\nu} &lt; 2, accompanied by intervalley coherence and anomalous Hall effects (AHE) that can be triggered by sweeping either B_per or B_par. Our work has unveiled new properties of orbital magnetism, providing a new knob for engineering various AHE in graphene.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Superconducting Pairing Symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$: from the Perspective of Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high $T_{c}$ and unconventional pairing mechanism. High-pressure experiments have demonstrated that the emergence of the superconducting phase is associated with a transition to a higher-symmetry structure. Motivated by this observation, we investigate superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure from the perspectives of symmetry and topology. Based on a bilayer two-orbital model with Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals, we systematically examine all symmetry-allowed multi-orbital superconducting pairings at the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field level, including terms up to next-nearest neighbors. By solving the self-consistent gap equations and analyzing the BdG condensation energies, we find that the $A_{1g}$ pairing channel is the most probable one. The dominant pairing is $s_{\pm}$-wave, originating from the intra-orbital interaction of the bilayer Ni-$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ orbital, while the subdominant pairing is $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave, arising from the inter-orbital interactions between the $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals. Furthermore, we implement the theory of symmetry indicator to reveal the topological characteristics of each pairing channel, demonstrating that the pairing symmetries can be identified by their distinct topological features.</description>

      <title>Infinite symmetry prevents disorder-induced localization in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that 2D gapped many-body quantum states are constrained by an infinite-dimensional symmetry which renders them transparent to weak disorder. This prevents disorder-induced localization when interactions are strong enough to open a gap. Using purely algebraic methods we derive all possible quantum states near the superconductor-to-insulator (SIT) transition and we compute the meson spectrum of superinsulators.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gaps revealed by STM measurements on La2PrNi2O7 thin films at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelate systems has generated tremendous interests in the field of superconductivity. The superconducting transition temperature above 80 K in La3Ni2O7 under pressure and the coexisting spin excitations certainly categorize the nickelate superconductors as unconventional. The core issue to understand the superconductivity mechanism is about the superconducting gap and its symmetry. By using the substrate of SrLaAlO4(00l), we have successfully synthesized the superconducting thin film of La2PrNi2O7 with Tc(onset) = 41.5 K. Superconducting tunneling spectra are successfully measured on the terraces after we remove the surface layer and expose the superconducting layer by using the tip-excavation technique. The spectrum shows a two-gap structure with Delta1 = 19 meV, Delta2 = 6 meV, and fittings based on the Dynes model indicate that the dominant gap should have an anisotropic s-wave structure, and the pure d-wave model fails to fit the data. Thus, our data put the priority in selecting the s+- among the two arguable pairing models: s+- and d-wave. Assuming the dominant interlayer superconducting gap, we obtain its magnitude to be Delta(perp) = 13 meV, while the intralayer gap Delta(para) is about 6 meV. Our results shed new light in understanding the mystery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Proximity-Induced Rashba Spin-Orbit Interaction in BaMnO$_\text{3}|$KTaO$_\text{3}$ Heterostructure for Antiferromagnetic Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of Rashba-like spin-orbit interaction in the antiferromagnetic BaMnO$_3|$KTaO$_3$ oxide heterostructure using density functional theory (DFT). The analysis of our charge transfer model based on electrostatic potential reveals a type-I band alignment and establishes the conditions under which the interface becomes conducting. Our calculations uncover pronounced linear Rashba splitting ($\alpha_{(1)}$ = 0.114~eV\AA) in Mn 3$d$ bands near the Fermi level, induced by proximity to Ta 5$d$ orbitals of the KTO substrate. The heterostructure exhibits inversion asymmetry due to polar discontinuities at its $p$-type and $n$-type interfaces. Using three-dimensional band dispersions and projected spin textures along with isoenergetic contours obtained from DFT calculations, we confirm the linear Rashba nature of the spin-orbit coupling. Employing Monte Carlo simulations based on DFT-derived magnetic exchange interactions, we estimate a N\'{e}el temperature of approximately $\sim 54 \mathrm{~K}$. Our results demonstrate a viable route to engineering strong spin-orbit coupling in centrosymmetric antiferromagnets for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose SineKAN, the NQS ansatz based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \sk wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the 1D Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the SineKAN model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state ans\"atze, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFCN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations in the $SU(3)$ triangular-lattice $t$-$J$ model at finite doping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation platforms have become powerful tools for investigating strongly correlated systems beyond the capabilities of classical computation. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms and molecules now enable experimental realizations of SU(N)-symmetric Fermi-Hubbard models, yet theoretical understanding of these systems, particularly at finite doping remains limited. Here we investigate the strong-coupling limit of the $SU(3)$ symmetric Fermi-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with dimensions up to $9\times9$ lattice sites across the full doping range. Using a three-flavor extension of Gutzwiller-projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS), a neural network based variational ansatz, we analyze two- and three-point spin-spin and spin-spin-hole correlations of the $SU(3)$ Cartan generators. We further study binding energies for large periodic systems, and compare our results to the paradigmatic $SU(2)$ square lattice equivalent, finding strikingly similar magnetic correlations, but enhanced binding energies. Our results provide a foundation for future exploration of doped SU(N) Mott insulators, providing valuable insights for both theoretical developments and quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Violation of Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis in $W_3$ Conformal Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a large central charge conformal field theory with $W_3$ symmetry exhibits violation of the conjectured operator growth bound if the Liouvillian is modified to incorporate $W_3$ generators. We get 23 classes of Lanczos coefficients, obtained by the action of the Liouvillian on a descendant state. Among these, 10 classes of Lanczos coefficients violate the conjectured upper bound by exhibiting a faster than linear growth with descendant level $N$. Two classes of them have asymptotic growth saturating at $N^2$.</description>

Abstract: Topological holography is a holographic principle that describes the generalized global symmetry of a local quantum system in terms of a topological order in one higher dimension. This framework separates the topological data from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points, and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories. The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories. This framework provides a simple physical picture to understand conformal boundary states and also uncovers the nature of the gapped phases corresponding to the boundary states.</description>

      <title>Merons, hedgehogs and magnetoelectric switching in spiral multiferroics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spiral multiferroics, magnetism induces ferroelectricity, thus holding a promise for novel memory devices where an electric field switches magnetic bits. However, such a switching process, in which magnetic domain walls are moved electrically, is still poorly understood. We find multiferroic domain walls containing arrays of meron (half-skyrmion) strings with a plethora of topological defects, which profoundly affect wall dynamics. Minimum energy walls have alternating meron topological charges and move as relativistic massive particles, with velocity limited by the magnon speed. During domain nucleation, walls with non-alternating meron charges appear. Such defects result in a peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, and the wall mobility is suppressed. Meron strings possess 0D hedgehog defects, analogous to Bloch points, that pin the wall to the lattice. This fascinating interplay of magnetoelectric switching with a variety of topological defects and non-local spin dynamics opens a new playground for the electric manipulation of spins.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

      <title>Efficient conversion from fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermionic Gaussian states are eigenstates of quadratic Hamiltonians and are widely used in quantum many-body problems. We propose a highly efficient algorithm that converts fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states. It can be formulated for finite-size systems without translation invariance, but becomes particularly appealing when applied to infinite systems with translation invariance. If the ground states of a topologically ordered system on infinite cylinders are expressed as matrix product states, then the fixed points of the transfer matrix can be harnessed to filter out the anyon eigenbasis, also known as minimally entangled states. This allows for efficient computation of universal properties, such as the entanglement spectrum and modular matrices. The potential of our method is demonstrated by numerical calculations in two chiral spin liquids that have the same topological orders as the bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states, respectively. The anyon eigenbasis for the first one has been worked out before and serves as a useful benchmark. The anyon eigenbasis of the second one is, however, not transparent, and its successful construction provides a nontrivial corroboration of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exact solutions for excited states in non-integrable quantum Hamiltonians have revealed novel dynamical phenomena that can occur in quantum many-body systems. This work proposes a method to analytically construct a specific set of volume-law-entangled zero-energy exact excited eigenstates in a large class of spin Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that all spin chains that satisfy a simple set of conditions host exact volume-law zero-energy eigenstates in the middle of their spectra. Examples of physically relevant spin chains of this type include the transverse-field Ising model, PXP model, spin-$S$ $XY$ model, and spin-$S$ Kitaev chain. Although these eigenstates are highly atypical in their structure, they are thermal with respect to local observables. Our framework also unifies many recent constructions of volume-law entangled eigenstates in the literature. Finally, we show that a similar construction also generalizes to spin models on graphs in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the use of finite-size fermionic projected entangled pair states, in conjunction with variational Monte Carlo, to perform accurate simulations of the ground-state of the 2D Hubbard model. Using bond dimensions of up to $D=28$, we show that we can surpass state-of-the-art DMRG energies that use up to $m=32000$ SU(2) multiplets on 8-leg ladders. We further apply our methodology to $10\times 16$, $12\times 16$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices at $1/8$ hole doping and observe the dimensional crossover between stripe orientations. Our work shows the power of finite-size fermionic tensor networks to resolve the physics of the 2D Hubbard model and related problems.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Stability Switches from Attractive to Repulsive at 2d Pomeranchuk/Stoner Instabilities via Field-Theoretical RG</title>

Abstract: We study an interacting two-flavor fermionic system via field-theoretical functional renormalization group (RG). Each flavor, labeled by $\pm$, has a dispersion of $E^{\pm}=c k^{2\alpha}-\mu^\pm$ with tunable real exponent $\alpha&gt;0$. The effective theory is parametrized by intra-flavor and inter-flavor interactions, preserving global U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetry, which can be enhanced to U(2). The U(2) symmetric system has a Fermi liquid phase and two possible instabilities, leading to spontaneous spatial rotational or flavor symmetry breaking, known as the Pomeranchuk and Stoner instabilities, respectively. The key discovery of this work is the following. The Stoner instability possesses an RG fixed point that preserves the U(2) symmetry. For $\alpha&lt;1$, this fixed point is attractive, indicating a continuous transition. Conversely, for $\alpha&gt;1$, the fixed point becomes repulsive, and without fine-tuning, there is runaway RG flow, resulting in a discontinuous transition. The U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetric system, with $\mu^+\neq \mu^-$, exhibits richer physics. This system have two Pomeranchuk instabilities. At one of them, a non-trivial RG fixed point switches its nature from attractive to repulsive as $\alpha$ increases across $1$. Notably, the runaway flow at $\alpha&gt;1$ results in the depletion of a Fermi surface at the transition. Collective modes in these Fermi liquids are also investigated. A universal Fermi surface deformation ratio $\delta\mu^+/\delta\mu^-$ is predicted for $\alpha&lt;1$ at the instability as a continuous transition, which can be observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Quantum selection of order and dynamic properties of Kitaev-Heisenberg ferromagnet on a triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent interest in monolayer materials motivated a search for two-dimensional ferromagnets with sizable spin-orbit coupling. Magnetic anisotropy of exchange Hamiltonian, induced by spin-orbit coupling, may not only stabilize long-range order, but also in turn can be a source of frustration and accidental degeneracy, which is the case for the Kitaev-Heisenberg model. Here we present an extensive study of ground state and excitations of ferromagnetic anisotropic-exchange Kitaev-Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice using order-by-disorder and augmented spin-wave theory calculations. It is shown that while bond-dependent terms of the model do not affect the ground state classically, quantum fluctuations select preferred magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic state and significantly alter classical phase diagram. Anisotropic terms of the magnetic Hamiltonian also give rise to magnon-magnon interactions that lead to spontaneous decay and spectral renormalization, which we illustrate using non-linear spin-wave theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. We address this challenge by introducing a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion as an efficient numerical approach to the DSF for arbitrary lattices. We focus on the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model and spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We present a user-friendly numerical implementation and provide comprehensive benchmarks on spin chains. As applications we treat a variety of frustrated two- and three dimensional antiferromagnets. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for a S=1 pyrochlore material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. The resulting analysis leads to an expression for the ground state correlation energy that is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hall Conductivities in Local Commuting Projector Models: Generalized Symmetries and Protected Surface Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hall conductivities are important characterizations of phases of matter. It is known that nonzero Hall conductivities are difficult to realize in local commuting projector lattice models due to no-go theorems in (2+1)D. In this work we construct local commuting projector models in (2+1)D and (3+1)D with nonzero generalized Hall conductivities for ordinary and higher-form continuous symmetries on tensor product Hilbert space of finite local dimension. The model is given by a standard $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, but the symmetries do not admit expression in terms of onsite charge operators. The symmetry do not have local charges or currents on the lattice in the absence of boundaries, but there is still notion of Hall conductivities that coincide with the continuum field theories. We construct protected gapless boundaries of the lattice models using modified Villain formalism. The generalized Hall conductivities are computed by surface currents as well as bulk flux insertion and many body Chern number.</description>

      <title>Robustness of topological edge states in alternating spin chains against environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both the Haldane spin-$1$ chain and dimerized chains of
  spin-$1/2$ exhibit topologically protected edge states that
  are robust against specific perturbations. Recently, such spin
  chains have been specifically assembled on surfaces and we
  investigate here the robustness of these edge states against
  coupling to the surface. Since no physical system can be considered perfectly isolated, it
  is crucial to examine whether topological robustness is maintained in the
  presence of environmental coupling.
  We apply exact diagonalization to a Lindblad master equation that couples an
  alternating Heisenberg spin chain based on spins $1/2$ to a surface via
  various jump operators. The robustness of topological states is assessed via the
  time evolution of quantities such as the ground-state degeneracy, correlation
  function, entropy, and magnetization of edge states.
  We investigate chains built from dimers with antiferromagnetic and
  ferromagnetic intra-dimer coupling, which resemble
  Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Haldane models, resp., and assess the
  impact of $z$-axis anisotropy and longer-ranged couplings. Generally,
  we find that signatures of topological properties are
  more robust in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like chains than in
  Haldane-like chains.</description>

      <title>The index of lattice Dirac operators and $K$-theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We mathematically show an equality between the index of a Dirac operator on a flat continuum torus and the $\eta$ invariant of a lattice Dirac operator known as the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass when the lattice spacing is sufficiently small. Unlike the standard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We prove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the corresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of the $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated by the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\eta$ invariant at a finite mass, are proved to be equal.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Spin-Splitting Magnetoresistance in Altermagnetic RuO2 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Nevertheless, the altermagnetism of RuO2, one of the earliest-discovered altermagnets, is currently under intense debate. Here we try to resolve this controversy by demonstrating an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) effect that is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. Compared to the spin Hall magnetoresistance induced by a conventional relativistic spin current, the SSMR is characterized by unusual angular dependence with a phase-shift feature underpinned by the Neel-vector orientation and pronounced temperature dependence caused by its susceptibility to electron scattering. Through systematical investigations on the magnetoresistance of (101)-RuO2/Co bilayers, we disentangle a sizable SSMR and hence unveil a Neel vector along [001] direction. Our work not only demonstrates a simple electric avenue to probing the Neel vector of altermagnets, but also indicates long-range magnetic order in thin films of RuO2.</description>

      <title>Entanglement as a topological marker in harmonically confined attractive Fermi-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the single-site von Neumann entropy along a harmonically confined superfluid chain, as described by the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with strongly attractive interactions. We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of \emph{interlayer} interaction terms in the competition between different superconducting gap symmetries in the bilayer nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under high pressure. We study a two-layer, two-orbital electron model that encompasses both intra- and interlayer Coulomb interaction terms within the matrix random-phase approximation. We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum field theories with global symmetry, we can study the behavior of the partition function with the background gauge field to diagnose different quantum phases. For the case of discrete symmetries, we find that the symmetry-twisted partition function works as an order parameter that discriminates spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states, and symmetry-enriched topological (SET) states. We then consider its application to the case of 4d Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matters to understand the relation between the twisted partition function and the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. We also study its behavior for the spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry and interpret the result from the viewpoint of the mixed anomaly with the emergent solitonic symmetry.</description>
