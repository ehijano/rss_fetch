      <title>Fully Automated OCT-based Tissue Screening System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a groundbreaking optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging system dedicated for high-throughput screening applications using ex vivo tissue culture. Leveraging OCT's non-invasive, high-resolution capabilities, the system is equipped with a custom-designed motorized platform and tissue detection ability for automated, successive imaging across samples. Transformer-based deep learning segmentation algorithms further ensure robust, consistent, and efficient readouts meeting the standards for screening assays. Validated using retinal explant cultures from a mouse model of retinal degeneration, the system provides robust, rapid, reliable, unbiased, and comprehensive readouts of tissue response to treatments. This fully automated OCT-based system marks a significant advancement in tissue screening, promising to transform drug discovery, as well as other relevant research fields.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Proton Therapy Using CBCT-Guided Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a digital twin (DT) framework to enhance adaptive proton stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer. Prostate SBRT has emerged as a leading option for external beam radiotherapy due to its effectiveness and reduced treatment duration. However, interfractional anatomy variations can impact treatment outcomes. This study seeks to address these uncertainties using DT concept, with the goal of improving treatment quality, potentially revolutionizing prostate radiotherapy to offer personalized treatment solutions. Our study presented a pioneering approach that leverages DT technology to enhance adaptive proton SBRT. The framework improves treatment plans by utilizing patient-specific CTV setup uncertainty, which is usually smaller than conventional clinical setups. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of prostate radiotherapy, with ultimate goals of improving patient outcomes and life quality.</description>

      <title>Current Views on Mechanisms of the FLASH Effect in Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is a new modality of radiotherapy by delivering doses with ultra-high dose rates. FLASH-RT has the ability to suppress tumor growth while sparing normal tissues, known as the FLASH effect. Although FLASH effect has proved valid in various models by different ionizing radiations, the exact underlying mechanism is still unclear. This article summarizes mainstream hypotheses of FLASH effect at physicochemical and biological levels, including oxygen depletion and free radical reactions, nuclear and mitochondria damage, as well as immune response. These hypotheses contribute reasonable explanations to the FLASH effect, and are interconnected according to the chronological order of the organism's response to ionizing radiation. By collating the existing consensus, evidence, and hypotheses, this article provides a comprehensive overview of potential mechanisms of FLASH effect and practical guidance for future investigation in the field of FLASH-RT.</description>

      <title>Scaling convolutional neural networks achieves expert-level seizure detection in neonatal EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Neonatal seizures are a neurological emergency that require urgent treatment. They are hard to diagnose clinically and can go undetected if EEG monitoring is unavailable. EEG interpretation requires specialised expertise which is not widely available. Algorithms to detect EEG seizures can address this limitation but have yet to reach widespread clinical adoption.
  Methods: Retrospective EEG data from 332 neonates was used to develop and validate a seizure-detection model. The model was trained and tested with a development dataset ($n=202$) that was annotated with over 12k seizure events on a per-channel basis. This dataset was used to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) using a modern architecture and training methods. The final model was then validated on two independent multi-reviewer datasets ($n=51$ and $n=79$).
  Results: Increasing dataset and model size improved model performance: Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and Pearson's correlation ($r$) increased by up to 50% with data scaling and up to 15% with model scaling. Over 50k hours of annotated single-channel EEG was used for training a model with 21 million parameters. State-of-the-art was achieved on an open-access dataset (MCC=0.764, $r=0.824$, and AUC=0.982). The CNN attains expert-level performance on both held-out validation sets, with no significant difference in inter-rater agreement among the experts and among experts and algorithm ($\Delta \kappa &lt; -0.095$, $p&gt;0.05$).
  Conclusion: With orders of magnitude increases in data and model scale we have produced a new state-of-the-art model for neonatal seizure detection. Expert-level equivalence on completely unseen data, a first in this field, provides a strong indication that the model is ready for further clinical validation.</description>

      <title>Effects of skull properties on transcranial focused ultrasound transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the brain in a minimally invasive manner for a variety of clinical applications. However, acoustic inhomogeneities within the skull cause significant wave interactions, leading to difficulties in predicting the energy delivered to the target. We present a comprehensive examination of intracranial acoustic fields generated by focused ultrasound transducers and assess the characteristics of cranial bone that affect acoustic transmission. Acoustic field maps were generated at 88 regions of interest across 10 historical and 2 Thiel-embalmed human skull specimens with sonication at frequencies of 220 kHz, 650 kHz, and 1000 kHz. The average peak pressure attenuation was $3.1 \pm 1.4$ dB, $9.0 \pm 1.7$ dB, and $14.6 \pm 4.1$ dB, respectively. The average power attenuation was $5.0 \pm 2.4$ dB, $14.9 \pm 3.2$ dB, and $24.1 \pm 6.3$ dB, respectively. The effect of skull thickness, skull density ratio, and skull curvature on intracranial peak pressure and power was investigated and linear fits produced. Our results demonstrate that Thiel-embalmed samples fall within the confidence intervals of fits for historical samples. The effects of angulation and spacing between the transducer and the skull were also investigated. Results indicate that wave superposition resulting from skull and transducer spacing could lead to a 30-40% uncertainty in peak recorded intracranial pressure.</description>
