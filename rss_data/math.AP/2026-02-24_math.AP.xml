      <title>A new family of solitons for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing boundary conditions in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In space dimensions $N \geq 4$, we introduce a new minimization procedure to construct traveling wave solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing boundary conditions at spatial infinity. We denote the family of solitons obtained using this construction by $\mathscr{J}$. Mari\c{s} (Ann. of Math. 178:107-182, 2013) obtained a family of solitons by minimizing the action functional subject to a Pohozaev constraint; we use $\mathscr{P}$ to denote this family of solitons. Chiron and Mari\c{s} (Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 226:143-242, 2017) used minimizing energy at fixed momentum to obtain a family of solitons; we denote this family of solitons by $\mathscr{Q}$. We show that, under some conditions, we have $\mathscr{Q} \subset \mathscr{J} \subset \mathscr{P}$. In addition, we show that $\mathscr{P} \subset \mathscr{J}$ under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>Green representations and global H\"older continuity for solutions of elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N\in\mathbb{N}$ and $u$ be a weak solution of equation $\displaystyle Lu\equiv - \sum_{i,j=1}^{N}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}}(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{i}}b^{ij})= f$ in $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$. We obtain functions $G$ and $H_{l}$ on $\Omega\times \Omega$ for every $l\in\{1,\cdots,N\}$ having following properties: if $f$ is in $L^{1}(\Omega)$, then $\int_{\Omega}G(x,y)f(x)dx = u(y)$, $\int_{\Omega}H_{l}(x,y)f(x)dx = -\frac{\ \partial u}{\partial x_{l}}(y)\quad a.e~y\in \Omega, \forall~l\in\{1,\cdots,N\}.$</description>

      <title>Statistical Error Bounds for Generative Solvers of Chaotic PDEs: Wasserstein Stability, Generalization, and Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical solutions of incompressible Euler describe turbulent dynamics as time-parameterized laws on $L^2$ whose multi-point correlations satisfy an infinite hierarchy of weak identities. Modern generative samplers for PDE forecasting (flow matching, rectified flows, diffusion via probability-flow ODEs) are measure-transport mechanisms and therefore induce Markov operators on laws. We develop a law-level analysis compatible with the correlation-measure framework of Lanthaler--Mishra--Par\'es-Pulido (LM): convergence in $d_T(\mu,\nu)=\int_{0}^{T} W_{1}\!\bigl(\mu_t,\nu_t\bigr)\,\mathrm{d}t$, compactness controlled by structure functions, and identification of limits through hierarchy identities.
  Quantitatively, we prove a $W_2$ stability estimate whose growth rate is a distance-weighted average strain under optimal couplings, and a one-step error decomposition into a resolved mismatch term and an unavoidable high-frequency coverage tail controlled by structure-function (spectral) bounds. These inputs propagate through multi-step rollouts via a discrete Gr\"onwall recursion with amplification governed by the average-strain exponent rather than a worst-case Lipschitz constant. On the qualitative side, sampler-native path controls yield LM time regularity; together with uniform energy and structure-function bounds this gives precompactness in $d_T$ and strong convergence of LM-admissible observables. If hierarchy residuals vanish along a sequence, every limit is an LM statistical solution, with residuals bounded by training-native drift/score regression errors. Finally, we show how common finite-grid diagnostics--proper distributional scores and likelihood-style certificates--admit principled interpretations as resolved observables within the same statistical-solution framework.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on half spaces and Orthants: Best constants, Optimizers and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though the sharp Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle has been extensively studied in the entire Euclidean spaces, the counterpart on the half spaces or more general orthants has been missing in the literature. We investigate the sharp Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on orthants by computing explicitly the optimal constant and determining all possible extremal functions. Moreover, we establish several stability estimates of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle on the half spaces and orthants.</description>

      <title>Steady states and dynamics of a higher dimensional thin film equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a higher-dimensional thin film equation that incorporates competitive effects between aggregation and repulsion, where repulsion is modeled by fourth-order diffusion and aggregation by backward second-order degenerate diffusion, with a degenerate diffusion exponent $m&gt;0$. We first conduct a systematic analysis of the existence and geometric properties of steady-state solutions for all $m&gt;0$, revealing a critical threshold $m^*=(d+2)/(d-2)$ for variational compactness and solution structure. For $0 &lt; m &lt; m^*$, we then prove that, under natural regularity constraints, radially decreasing steady states coincide with both the extremals of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality and the global minimizers of the free energy. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of such steady states for $m \neq 1 + 2/d$. Furthermore, in the supercritical regime $1 + 2/d &lt; m &lt; m^*$, we identify a sharp threshold given by the $L^{m+1}$ norm of the unique radial steady-state solution, which distinguishes between global existence for initial data below the threshold and finite-time blow-up for initial data above the threshold. The main contribution of this work is to use steady-state solutions as a theoretical pivot to construct a unified analytical framework that connects parameter classification, variational structure and dynamic behavior. This framework elucidates how the regularity barrier prevents infinite energy descent and selects stable equilibrium states, and thus predicts the global evolution of the system, thereby providing a unified variational principle for understanding steady-state selection and dynamic bifurcations in such higher-order degenerate diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Slow-fast system in Rosales-Majda combustion model with fractional order kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider traveling wave solutions of a one-dimensional model for detonation waves derived by Rosales and Majda, when the reaction order $\alpha$ belongs to $[0,1)$. The chemical kinetics is a simplified Arrhenius law or a Heaviside function. The model in the reaction zone is a slow-fast dynamical system for a vector representing temperature and mass fraction, which depends on the velocity $c$ and small viscosity $\beta$. Our goal in this paper is to study the bifurcation diagram in the $(\beta,c)$ parameter space and identify the nature of the trajectories corresponding to viscous shock waves. The demonstrations are based on a variety of techniques including the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem and the Fenichel theory. Theoretical results are confirmed by numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Multiple positive bound states for NLS equations on noncompact metric graphs with an attractive potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of bounded states and geometrically distinct solutions for the subcritical NLS equation with attractive potential on metric graphs $\mathcal{G}$ when the mass $\mu$ is large enough.We show that the NLS equation exists at least as many bound states of mass $\mu$ as the number of bounded edges of $\mathcal{G}$ if the attractive potential satisfies some suitable assumptions.It is worth noting that this is different from the case of ground state, which on some graphs may fail to exist for every value of $\mu$.</description>

      <title>A unified duality framework for barotropic, quantum and Korteweg fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a dual variational formulation, in the spirit of Brenier, for several compressible fluid models: the compressible barotropic Euler system, the quantum Euler system, and the Euler-Korteweg system. We identify a unified abstract framework encompassing all three systems, which enables a simultaneous analysis. By introducing time-adaptive weights, we establish the consistency of the duality scheme on large time intervals. We prove the existence of variational dual solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problems for continuous, vacuum-free initial data in spaces of finite Radon measures, and establish the absence of a duality gap. As an application, we formulate and prove a 'Dafermos principle' for these models: no subsolution can dissipate the total entropy earlier or at a faster rate than the corresponding strong solution on its interval of existence. We also discuss connections between our abstract consistency result and Brenier's shock-free substitutes for entropy solutions of Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>A generalized Helmholtz-type decomposition of symmetric tensor fields and applications to ray transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a solenoidal-potential type decomposition of a symmetric $m$-tensor field in $\Rb^2$, and its implications to injectivity questions for the momentum and elastic ray transforms. For symmetric tensor fields, a general decomposition with a restriction on the dimension and order of the decomposition was proved in~\cite{Rohit_Suman}. We extend the result to dimension $2$ under a mean-zero assumption. We use the decomposition in $2$ dimensions to prove the injectivity of the momentum and elastic ray transforms. We also prove a connection between the two integral transforms for $2$-tensors.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis for a doubly degenerate parabolic equation: Application to the Richards equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical analysis of a doubly degenerate parabolic equation and its application to the Richards equation using a bounded auxiliary variable. We establish the existence of weak solutions using semi-implicit time discretization combined with maximal monotone operator theory. The analysis is conducted within weighted Sobolev spaces, allowing for a rigorous treatment of the equation's strict degeneracy and strong nonlinearities. A key feature of this study is the derivation of convergence results without imposing strictly positive lower bounds on the diffusivity or requiring high regularity of the solution. Furthermore, we prove that the Richards equation using the introduced auxiliary variable preserves the physical bounds of the saturation and demonstrate the unconditional linear convergence of the L-scheme linearization to the semi-discrete solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish radial symmetry for positive weak solutions of a class of mixed local-nonlocal equations with possibly singular nonlinearity via the moving plane method. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative version of Gidas-Ni-Nirenberg type theorem for mixed local-nonlocal equations. To this regard, we establish a weak Harnack-type inequality and an analogue of the Alexandroff-Bakelman-Pucci inequality in the mixed nonhomogeneous setting with a lower order term, which appear to be new. To the best of our knowledge, this paper initiates the study of the quantitative properties of solutions to mixed problems.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of smooth solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations on torus $\TTT^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local well-posedness theory for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\BMO^{-1}$ has attracted considerable attention over the past two decades. In a recent breakthrough, Coiculescu and Palasek (Invent. Math., 2025) settled the three-dimensional case by demonstrating the existence of two distinct global solutions, both smooth for $t&gt;0$, evolving from a common initial datum in ${\rm BMO}^{-1}(\mathbb{T}^3)$. However, the two-dimensional case remains open. In this paper, we solve the two-dimensional problem. Unlike its three-dimensional counterpart, the two-dimensional setting presents additional difficulties stemming from the geometric intersections of two-dimensional Mikado flows. To overcome these difficulties, we develop a heat-dominated Fourier mode flow built upon steady two-dimensional Euler flows, and present the proof using a new iterative scheme.</description>

      <title>A unified theory for diffusion with memory and delay via measure-valued kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a diffusion equation that incorporates historical effects, in which the memory-delay mechanism is represented by a nonnegative Borel measure $\mu$ on the interval $(0, \mathfrak T]$. The diffusion component is characterised by a coercive bilinear form $a_0$, while the historical term is modelled as a measure-induced convolution operator $\mathcal K_\mu$, derived from a bounded non-negative form $a_1$. This framework includes the memory-free parabolic problem ($\mu=0$), distributed-memory Volterra models ($d\mu(s)=k(s)\,ds$), discrete-delay models with atomic measures, and mixed kernels. For general finite measures $\mu$, we establish well-posedness over finite time horizons and derive stability bounds that remain applicable in the presence of delays. Subsequently, we identify a positive-type condition under which the memory term is dissipative, leading to a refined energy inequality. For absolutely continuous kernels, we provide verifiable sufficient conditions, including complete monotonicity, and an internal-variable representation that elucidates the decay mechanism.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spatially inhomogeneous non-cutoff Boltzmann equation with hard potentials in the non-perturbative setting. For initial data with polynomial decay in the velocity variable, we establish the local-in-time existence and uniqueness of weak solutions, conditional to pointwise bounds on the hydrodynamic quantities (mass, energy, and entropy). Compared to the soft potential case, the key challenge for full-range hard potentials lies in the more severe loss of velocity moments. The proof combines a hypoelliptic estimate with interpolation inequalities to handle the moment-loss terms.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of Nonscattering Wavenumbers for Herglotz Incident Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the study initiated in [30] on nonscattering phenomena for inhomogeneous media. We investigate star-shaped domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and establish finiteness results for nonscattering wavenumbers associated with Herglotz incident waves of fixed density. First, for ellipses with constant medium coefficient $q\in(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)$, we prove that there exist at most finitely many nonscattering wavenumbers. This generalizes and strengthens the corresponding results in [30], in particular removing additional geometric restrictions in the case $q&gt;1$. Second, for admissible $C^2$ star-shaped domains with $q\in(0,1)$, we establish analogous finiteness results under broader geometric assumptions on the radius function.

      <title>High-order long-time asymptotics for small solutions to the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global well-posedness and modified scattering for the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with gauge-invariant polynomial nonlinearity. For small localized initial data of finite energy in a low-regularity class, we establish global existence of solution together with persistence of the localization of the associated profile. We further provide a rigorous derivation of the asymptotic expansion at arbitrary order of such solutions, taking into account long-range effects induced by the cubic component of the nonlinearity. Our analysis relies on the space-time resonance method.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Second-Order Elliptic PDEs in Spectral Barron Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a regularity theorem for second-order elliptic PDEs on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ in spectral Barron spaces. Under mild ellipticity and smallness assumptions, the solution gains two additional orders of Barron regularity. As a corollary, we identify a class of PDEs whose solutions can be approximated by two-layer neural networks with cosine activation functions, where the width of the neural network is independent of the spatial dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian on Lipschitz domains. This is motivated by the recent postings by Amrouche and Moussaoui which purport to contradict known area integral estimates of Dahlberg and known Sobolev space estimates of Jerison and Kenig. We explain the fatal gap in the reasoning in these postings and give a self-contained proof of a special case of the results of Dahlberg. We then show that this is sufficient to disprove the central conclusions of these postings. We also provide two further proofs of the results of Dahlberg, adapted from work of Kenig and of Dahlberg-Kenig-Pipher-Verchota. Other proofs are in the original paper by Dahlberg and in work by Fabes-Mendez-Mitrea.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an inverse random source problem for the stochastic fractional Helmholtz equation. The source is modeled as a centered, complex-valued, microlocally isotropic generalized Gaussian random field whose covariance and relation operators are described by classical pseudo-differential operators. For sufficiently large wavenumbers, we first establish the well-posedness of the direct problem in the distributional sense by analyzing the corresponding Lippmann--Schwinger integral equation. For the inverse problem, we show that the principal symbols of both the covariance and relation operators can be uniquely determined, with probability one, from the far-field patterns generated by a single realization of the random source. The approach employs a combination of the Born linearization, asymptotic expansions of the fractional Helmholtz Green kernel at high wavenumbers, and microlocal analysis of associated Fourier integral operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homogenization of the Poisson equation in randomly perforated domains and obtain the strange term effect in the homogenized equation. The perforations are modeled by rescaled germ-grain processes, and the main assumption is stationarity of the capacities of the holes. We emphasize that the potential in the homogenized equation is constant, despite the possibly nonstationary spatial distribution of the holes. We also establish corrector results.</description>

      <title>Gradual smoothing: strong hypercontractivity and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of a gradual improvement as time progresses of the regularity of solutions to evolution problems of parabolic type driven by L\'evy operators, not necessarily translation invariant. In the course of our analysis we study the equivalence between general smoothing effects and a family of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. This equivalence allows us to identify a new type of regularization, strong hypercontractivity, characterized by the existence of a time at which solutions belong to every $L^p$ space with $p$ finite. It can also be used to prove logarithmic Sobolev inequalities in a context not previously seen in the literature. We then show that any purely nonlocal L\'evy operator whose kernel is comparable to that of $\log(I-\Delta)$ is strongly hypercontractive, but fails to be supercontractive and, consequently, also fails to be ultracontractive. Finally, in the translation-invariant case, we also prove that solutions get bounded eventually.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian approach for prescribed mass solutions of cubic-quintic Schr\"odinger equations and $L^2$-supercritical problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of radially symmetric solutions of the following nonlinear scalar field equations in $\mathbb R^N$ ($N \geq 2$):
  $$ (*)_m \quad - \Delta u + \mu u = g(u) \quad \text{in}\ {\mathbb R}^N, \quad {1\over 2} \int_{{\mathbb R}^N} u^2\, dx = m,$$
  where $g(s) \in C({\mathbb R},{\mathbb R})$, $m &gt; 0$ and $\mu \in {\mathbb R}$ is an unknown Lagrangian multiplier. We take an approach using a Lagrangian formulation of $(*)_m$:
  $$J_m(\mu,u)={1\over 2}\int_{{\mathbb R}^N} |\nabla u|^2\,dx -\int_{{\mathbb R}^N} G(u)\,dx +\mu\left({1\over 2}\int_{{\mathbb R}^N} u^2\, dx-m\right) \in C^1((0,\infty)\times H_r^1({\mathbb R}^N), {\mathbb R})$$
  and we give new general existence results through the function:
  $$ b_m:\, (0,\infty) \to {\mathbb R};\ \mu \mapsto \text{Mountain Pass minimax value for}\ (u\mapsto J_m(\mu,u)).$$
  We will show the existence of solutions of $(*)_m$ related to local minima and local maxima of $b_m(\mu)$. As applications, we study cubic-quintic type equations and $L^2$-supercritical problems. In particular, when $N=2,3$, we show new existence results of normalized solutions without assuming global Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz type conditions, which partially improve the preceding results due to Jeanjean [24] and Jeanjean-Lu [26, 28].</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of strong solutions to the non-isentropic compressible primitive equations with vertical diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the absence of dynamical equation in the vertical momentum component of the primitive equations (PEs) of atmospheric dynamics, the vertical component of the velocity can be recovered only from the information on the other physical quantities, while utilizing the hydrostatic balance. This causes one spatial derivative loss while leads to a stronger nonlinearity, comparing to the classic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, the mathematical analysis on the compressible primitive equations is mathematically more challenging than that on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem to the non-isentropic compressible primitive equations with only vertical diffusion for the temperature, but without gravity. Local existence and uniqueness as well as the continuous dependence on the initial data of strong solutions are established for any suitably regular initial data. The initial velocity and pressure are assumed here to be of one order derivative higher regularity than that of the initial density.</description>

      <title>Sharp non-uniqueness for the Navier-Stokes equations in scaling critical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that uniqueness of mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations holds in the critical class $C([0,T);L^n(\mathbb{R}^n))$ for $n \geqslant 3$. In this paper, we prove that this result is sharp in the sense that uniqueness fails if $L^n(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is replaced by some scaling critical spaces that are even slightly larger. We achieve this through a complete classification for every pair $(p,q)$ of whether uniqueness of mild solutions in the critical Besov class $C([0,T);\dot{B}_{p,q}^{n/p-1}(\mathbb{R}^n))$ holds or not. Our non-uniqueness mechanism produces infinitely many global solutions emanating even from zero initial state, whose large-time asymptotics are governed by non-trivial stationary flow. To the best of our knowledge, such non-unique solutions provide the first examples of non-dissipative unforced Navier-Stokes flow with critical regularity.</description>

      <title>Stability and Finite-Time Blow-Up for a Fractionally Damped Nonlinear Plate Equation: Numerical and Analytical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a nonlinear plate equation with internal fractional damping and a time-delay term, driven by a polynomial-type nonlinear source. Such a model arises naturally in the description of viscoelastic and feedback-controlled elastic structures. We first establish the local existence and uniqueness of weak solutions using semigroup theory. The long-time behavior of solutions is then analyzed by constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional, from which stability and energy decay results are obtained. Moreover, by applying the concavity method, we prove that solutions associated with negative initial energy blow up in finite time. These results highlight the competing effects of fractional damping and delayed feedback on the qualitative behavior of the system. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to confirm the analytical results and to illustrate both stability and blow-up dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Infinite: An Expository Journey Through Interpolation Theory, Lorentz Spaces, and Dispersive PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This expository article explores the vital role of interpolation theory and Lorentz spaces in the rigorous analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs). While classical Lebesgue spaces ($L_{p}$) successfully measure the magnitude of functions, they frequently fail to bound linear and non-linear evolution operators at critical endpoints of $p=1$ or $p = \infty$ because they conflate a function's amplitude with its spatial spread. To resolve this analytic bottleneck, we introduce distribution functions and decreasing rearrangements, culminating in the construction of Lorentz spaces ($L_{p, q}$). By utilizing the Complex (Riesz-Thorin) and Real (Peetre's K-functional) methods of interpolation, these highly sensitive intermediate spaces act as geometric bridges between endpoint extremes. We apply this framework to two distinct physical models: deriving the continuous smoothing decay of the parabolic Heat equation, and establishing the foundational dispersive Strichartz estimates for the hyperbolic free Schr\"odinger equation. Ultimately, interpolation theory is shown to be the essential mathematical language for quantifying both thermal diffusion and quantum dispersion.</description>

Abstract: We consider the compressible Magnetic Relaxation Equations on the three-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^{3}$. The system is derived from compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by replacing the acceleration term with a Darcy-type friction. Under planar symmetry, we establish three main results: (1) local well-posedness for smooth initial data, (2) magnetic relaxation for smooth perturbations of constant steady states, and (3) the absence of vacuum states or implosions prior to and at the time of a potential singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing inhomogeneities by performing a finite number of scattering measurements of acoustic type in the time-harmonic setting. We set up the reconstruction as a fully discrete variational problem with regularization. Such a problem depends on a variety of parameters, that is, the number of measurements, the regularization parameter and the discretization parameter, namely the size of the mesh on which we discretize the unknown coefficients of the Helmholtz type equation modelling our physical system. We show, through a convergence analysis, that one can carefully choose these parameters in such a way that the solution to this discrete regularized minimum problem is a good approximation of the looked-for solution to the inverse problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a scattering matrix with operator valued entries describing solutions to the 1+1 wave equation where permittivities has memory and depends on time and space. It is the analogue of the scattering matrix for spatially localised perturbations where the entries are functions of frequency and appear as Fourier multipliers in solutions of the wave equation. This provides a mathematical explanation of the numerical construction in the recent paper by Horsley et al. The appendix by Zhen Huang and Maciej Zworski presents a numerical scheme for solving the wave equation considered in this article.</description>

      <title>Global and local properties of solutions of elliptic equations with a nonlinear term involving the product of the function and its gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global and local properties of positive solutions to the quasi-linear elliptic equation:
  \d u+|\nabla u|^q u^p=0,\quad x\in \O\subset \mathbb{R}^n,\nonumber where $q\ge 0$ and $p\in\mathbb{R}$. Our contributions are twofold: 
  1. Based on an optimal and new identity for the modulus squared of the logarithmic gradient, we establish optimal and improved Liouville theorems for global positive solutions, and generalize these findings to the framework of Riemannian manifolds.
  2. Based on a newly discovered mutual control relationship of two nonlinear iterms, for all index pairs \( (p, q) \) where the Liouville theorem holds, we derive several optimal gradient estimates for local positive solutions. As a direct corollary, we obtain the corresponding Harnack inequality.
  These results strengthen the related conclusions in Bidaut-V\'eron--Garc\'ia-Huidobro--V\'eron \cite {BGV} from both global and local perspectives.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for incompressible fluid-Koiter shell interactions with Navier slip boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction problem describing the motion of an incompressible, viscous fluid coupled with a deformable elastic shell of Koiter type that forms part of the fluid boundary. The fluid motion is governed by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations posed on a time-dependent domain, while the shell evolution is described by a nonlinear elastic model. At the fluid-structure interface, we impose Navier slip boundary conditions, allowing for tangential slip penalized by friction. Our main result establishes the global-in-time existence of weak solutions up to the first possible self-intersection of the shell, for arbitrarily large initial data with finite energy. The analysis is carried out in a fully three-dimensional setting and addresses the major mathematical challenges arising from the moving domain, the geometric nonlinearity of the shell, and the reduced regularization induced by the slip boundary condition. The proof relies on a careful construction of suitable approximation schemes, novel compactness arguments adapted to the slip framework, and a new extension operator for divergence-free test functions compatible with the fluid-shell coupling. As a further contribution, we provide a direct approach to the strong convergence of second-order spatial derivatives of the shell displacement, which allows us to treat nonlinear Koiter shell models within the same framework.</description>

      <title>A Liouville-type theorem for $2$-Monge-Amp\`ere equation in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every entire solution with quadratic growth, lying in a suitable cone, to the 2-Monge-Amp\`ere equation on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a quadratic polynomial. The proof proceeds by first establishing a concavity inequality, and then deriving a Pogorelov-type interior $C^2$ estimate.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of a single vortex ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global-in-time dynamics of vortex rings for the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations, under the assumption of axisymmetric flows without swirl.
  For a broad class of initial data sharing only the macroscopic invariants with a thin vortex ring, we prove that the vorticity remains sharply concentrated and propagates along the symmetry axis with leading-order speed given by the Kelvin--Hicks formula, providing the first global-in-time validation of the vortex filament conjecture for a single vortex ring arising from generic initial data.
  We further identify a universal filamentation mechanism driven by the competition between rapid core translation and slower local induction. This mechanism gives linear-in-time stretching of the vortex support under very general assumptions on the data, yielding dynamical instability of any thin vortex ring configurations in the $W^{2,\infty}$ norm.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of explicit formulas for $L^2$ solutions to the Benjamin-Ono and continuum Calogero-Moser equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By developing discrete counterparts to recent advances in nonlinear integrability, and in particular to the discovery of explicit formulas, we design and analyze fully-discrete approximations to the Benjamin-Ono (BO) and continuum Calogero-Moser (CCM) equations on the torus. We build on the key observation that discretizing such explicit formulas yields schemes that are exact in time (requiring only spatial discretization) and have a computational cost independent of the final time $T$. In this work, we first generalize the fully-discrete schemes of arXiv:2412.13480 to include numerical approximations with better structure preservation properties, including the conservation of mass and momentum in the case of the (BO) equation. Secondly, building on recent analyses of the corresponding Lax operators, we extend the convergence results to this class of schemes for rough solutions $u(t)$ merely belonging to $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ for (BO) and $L^2_{+}(\mathbb{T})$ for (CCM), the latter of which is precisely the scaling-critical regularity. Our main theorem states that the $L^2(\mathbb{T})$-norm of the error goes to zero as the truncation parameters go to infinity, uniformly on any bounded time interval $[-T,T]$. As an example, we apply our scheme to the (BO) equation with a square-wave initial profile, and obtain the first numerical evidence of the Talbot effect for (BO) supported by a rigorous convergence result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative stability of Kantorovich potentials on metric measure spaces with lower Ricci curvature bound, thereby confirming a recent conjecture of Kitagawa, Letrouit and M\'erigot. Our proof, which employs the heat kernel-regularized $c$-transform, does not rely on linear structure or sectional curvature bounds. As a corollary, we get a quantitative stability of optimal transport maps on Alexandrov spaces with lower curvature bound.</description>

      <title>The Burgers Transform: From Holomorphic Functions to Rigid Elliptic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Burgers transform $\mathcal{B}$, a nonlinear bijection between holomorphic functions $f\colon U\to\mathbb{C}^+$ and rigid variable elliptic structures on the plane, defined implicitly by $\lambda = f(y-\lambda x)$. The output automatically satisfies the conservative complex Burgers equation $\lambda_x+\lambda\lambda_y=0$.
  Our main result is that holomorphicity of the seed $f$ is necessary, not merely sufficient, for rigidity: any $C^1$ function whose implicit solution satisfies $\lambda_x+\lambda\lambda_y=0$ must be holomorphic. This closes a gap in the existing literature and identifies $\operatorname{Hol}(U,\mathbb{C}^+)$ as the maximal seed space compatible with rigidity. The obstruction formula $H|_{x=0} = 2i\,(\operatorname{Im} f)\,f_{\bar{w}}$ quantifies the cost of non-holomorphicity at the level of the initial data.
  The transform establishes a hierarchy we call $f$-analytics: standard complex analysis ($f=i$), $p(x)$-analytics ($f\colon U\to i\mathbb{R}_+$), and the full rigid class ($f\colon U\to\mathbb{C}^+$ holomorphic), in which rigidity -- absent from the real diameter of $\mathbb{D}$ -- emerges as a genuinely complex phenomenon. We characterise the domain of $\mathcal{B}$ through shock formation, its interaction with affine automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^+$, and the infinitesimal structure: the propagator $\mathcal{P}_f = D\mathcal{B}_f$ satisfies a Jacobian-twisted multiplicativity that deforms the seed algebra by the density of characteristics. Four worked examples -- affine, exponential, inverse, and trigonometric seeds -- show that the complexity class of a seed and that of the resulting structure are generically unrelated.</description>

      <title>The extremely-tilted fluid regime near asymptotically Kasner big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the relativistic Euler equations with a linear barotropic equation of state on a large class of background spacetimes with Kasner big bang asymptotics. Building on previous work in the asymptotically non-tilted regime, which applies when the speed of sound of the fluid is large in comparison to the Kasner exponents, we now consider the asymptotically extremely-tilted regime when the speed of sound is small. We solve the Cauchy problem for the Euler equations towards the big bang singularity and prove, without any symmetry assumptions or smallness conditions on the Cauchy data, that the solutions exist globally in time provided the mean curvature of the initial hypersurface is sufficiently large. Finally, we prove that the solutions exhibit the asymptotics expected from standard heuristic arguments in this regime; in particular, fluid particles are driven towards the speed of light in the direction of the largest Kasner exponent as the big bang singularity is approached.</description>

      <title>Optimal Error Estimates of a new Multiphysic Finite Element Method for Nonlinear Poroelasticity model with Hencky-Mises Stress Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new multiphysics finite element method for a nonlinear poroelastic model with Hencky-Mises stress tensor. By introducing some new notations, we reformulate the original model into a fluid-fluid coupling problem, which is viewed as a generalized nonlinear Stokes sub-problem combined with a reaction-diffusion sub-problem. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for the reformulated problem, and propose a stable, fully discrete multiphysics finite element method which employs Lagrangian finite element pairs for spatial discretization and a backward Euler scheme for temporal discretization. By ensuring the parameters $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_3$ remain bounded and non-zero even as $\lambda$ tends to infinity, the proposed method maintains stability for a wide range of Lagrangian element pairs. Based on the continuity and monotonicity of the nonlinear term $\mathcal{N}(\varepsilon(\mathbf{u}_h^{n}))$, we give the stability analysis and derive optimal error estimates for the displacement vector $\mathbf{u}$ and the pressure $p$ in both $L^2$-norm and $H^1$-norm. In particular, the $L^2$-norm error estimate for the displacement $\mathbf{u}$, which was not present in previous literature, is established here through an auxiliary problem and a Poincar$\acute{e}$ inequality. Also, we present numerical tests to verify the theoretical analysis, and the results confirm the optimal convergence rates. Finally, we draw conclusions to summarize the work.</description>

      <title>Schauder estimates for germs of distributions on smooth manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss germs of distributions on $d-$dimensional smooth Riemannian manifolds and, in particular, we derive \emph{multi-level Schauder estimates} without making any further assumptions on the underlying geometry. As a preliminary step, we define the notions of coherence and homogeneity for germs of distributions on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \ge 1$. Subsequently, we formulate both the reconstruction theorem, cf., [CZ20], and the Schauder estimates, cf., [BCZ24], in this setting. Leveraging the properties of the exponential map, we extend these results to Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we devise a counterpart of the reconstruction theorem previously established in the literature [RS21], while additionally proving the regularity of the reconstructed distribution in suitable H\"older-Zygmund spaces. Finally, by introducing a novel concept of $\beta$-regularizing kernels on Riemannian manifolds, we establish Schauder estimates for coherent and homogeneous germs in this context.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Estimates on the Topology and Singular Set of Prescribed Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative topological and singularity properties for (certain) prescribed mean curvature (PMC) hypersurfaces $V^n$ in Riemannian manifolds $(N^{n+1},h)$. Indeed, if $V$ has area at most $A&gt;0$ with PMC given by a $C^{1,\alpha}$ function $g:N\to \mathbb{R}$ with the bound $|g|_{C^{1,\alpha}}\leq \Gamma$, we show that there exists a constant $C$ depending only on $n,h,A,\Gamma$ and geometric quantities such that: \[\sum^n_{i=0}b^i(V) \leq C(1+\text{index}(V)) \quad \text{if }3\leq n+1\leq 7;\] \[M^{*n-7}(\text{sing}(V)) \leq C(1+\text{index}(V)) \quad \text{if }n+1\geq 8.\] Here, $b^i$ denote the Betti numbers over any field, $M^{*n-7}$ denotes the upper $(n-7)$-dimensional Minkowski content, and $\text{sing}(V)$ is the singular set of $V$. The first inequality extends the work of Song from the minimal hypersurface setting to the PMC hypersurface setting, whilst the second extends work of the authors. Our results apply to the PMC hypersurfaces constructed recently through min-max techniques by Bellettini--Wickramasekera.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic optimal design problems for elliptic partial differential equations in divergence form, where the coefficients represent mixtures of two conducting materials. The objective is to minimize a generalized risk measure of the system response, incorporating uncertainty in the loading through probability distributions. We establish existence of relaxed optimal designs via homogenization theory and derive first-order stationarity conditions satisfied by the optima. Based on these conditions, we develop an optimality criteria algorithm for numerical computations. The stochastic component is treated using a truncated Karhunen--Lo\`eve expansion, allowing evaluation of the value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) contributions arising from the sensitivity analysis and featured in the algorithm. The method is illustrated for an example involving CVaR-based compliance minimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the spacetime positive mass theorem to include multiple time dimensions. In particular, we show that the mass remains nonnegative in the sense that the energy $E$ is bounded from below by the trace norm of the linear momenta $J^1,...,J^m$. Equality in this energy inequality implies a foliation by flat submanifolds of a generalized initial data set. Moreover, under an additional umbilicity assumption, we find that the initial data set isometrically embeds into a generalized pp-wave.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis of cell aggregates: morphology and dynamics of migrating active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological tissues have been observed to display emergent fluid-like properties, owing to physical interactions between cells. However, it remains unclear in general how these fluid-like properties affect tissue structure and function. Here, we are motivated by recent experiments in which cell aggregates were observed to behave as active droplets during collective migration along chemical gradients, or chemotaxis. To understand this process, we develop a minimal model of a growing thin active droplet driven by a self-generated chemical gradient. In broad agreement with the experiments, dynamic simulations reveal that chemotacting droplets exhibit proliferation-driven morphological transitions. To fully characterise these transitions, we perform a multiple scales analysis to show that the droplet dynamics follow a sequence of travelling wave solutions defined by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem parametrised by the slowly increasing droplet volume. Our analysis reveals that morphological transitions can occur continuously or through a discontinuous bifurcation. Further asymptotic analysis of the travelling wave problem reveals that these morphological transitions arise from exponentially small ("beyond-all-orders") asymptotic terms that originate from the rear and front contact lines. Moreover, we show that the nature of the transitions is fully determined by two key dimensionless parameters, which quantify the internal stress balance within the droplet and the strength of the coupling between the droplet migration dynamics and the external chemical field. Overall, our results provide a complete characterisation of the morphodynamics of a class of migrating active thin droplets, with implications in a range of biological systems where cell aggregates exhibit fluid-like behaviour.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-scalar field conformal constraint equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works by the second author and Dilts et al. have shown that the Einstein-scalar field conformal constraint equations are highly complex and generally intractable, even in the vacuum case. In this article, to gain a clearer understanding and offer a new perspective, we study these equations under special assumptions: the manifold $(M,g)$ is harmonic and data is radial.
  In this setting, the system reduces to a single nonlinear equation and is completely resolved in the standard cases. In particular, on the sphere, our results reveal phenomena that contrast with the well-known achievements on compact manifolds without conformal Killing vector fields, including nonexistence of solutions in the near-CMC regime and instability when the mean curvature is non-constant. By contrast, on Euclidean or hyperbolic manifolds, the equations are always solvable, with all expected properties of solutions satisfied. These findings support the view that, although the conformal method appears to present some drawbacks on compact manifolds, it remains a promising tool for parametrizing solutions to the constraint equations on asymptotically flat and hyperbolic manifolds in arbitrary mean curvature regimes.
  In this article, we also investigate the sign of mass, showing that the ADM and asymptotically hyperbolic mass can take arbitrary sign when the decay rate of symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor $k$ at infinity is critical. Finally, most solution classes in our framework are explicit, providing a variety of models in general relativity and offering insights into the structure and behavior of initial data, particularly in numerical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every $p,q\geq 1$, we construct minimal embeddings of $\mathbb{S}^p \times \mathbb{S}^q \times \mathbb{S}^1$ in $\mathbb{S}^{p + q + 2}$ by doubling the links of free-boundary minimal cones in $\mathbb{R}^{p+q+3}$ with bi-orthogonal symmetry. This solves problems posed by Hsiang-Lawson and Hsiang-Hsiang. The equivariance reduces the minimal surface equation to an ODE, and we prove the existence of capillary minimal cones for every contact angle. We obtain free-boundary solutions as limits of capillary surfaces via a singular shooting problem with infinite initial slope. As the contact angle degenerates to $0$, rescalings of the capillary cones converge to a homogeneous solution of the one-phase Bernoulli problem, further illustrating the connection between one-phase free boundaries and minimal surfaces through the capillary functional.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an Intra-host Diffusive Pathogen Infection Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.05058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a diffusive pathogen infection model with general incidence rate which incorporates cell-to-cell transmission. By applying the theory of monotone dynamical systems, we prove that the model admits the global threshold dynamics in terms of the basic reproduction number ($\mathcal{R}_{0}$), which is defined by the spectral radius of the next generation operator. Then, we derive a discrete counterpart of the continuous model by nonstandard finite difference scheme. The results show that the discrete model preserves the positivity and boundedness of solutions in order to ensure the well-posedness of the problem. Moreover, this method preserves all equilibria of the original continuous model. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals for both models, we show that the global threshold dynamics is completely determined by the basic reproduction number. Further, with the help of sensitivity analysis we also have identified the most sensitive parameters which effectively contribute to change the disease dynamics. Finally, we conclude the paper by an example and numerical simulations to improve and generalize some known results.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial absolutely continuous part of anomalous dissipation measures in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We positively answer Question 2.2 and Question 2.3 in [Bru\`e, De Lellis, 2023] in dimension $4$ by building new examples of solutions to the forced $4d$ incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which exhibit anomalous dissipation, related to the zeroth law of turbulence [K41]. We also prove that the unique smooth solution $v_\nu$ of the $4d$ Navier--Stokes equations with time-independent body forces is $L^\infty$-weakly* converging to a solution of the forced Euler equations $v_0$ as the viscosity parameter $\nu \to 0$. Furthermore, the sequence $\nu |\nabla v_\nu|^2$ is weakly* converging (up to subsequences), in the sense of measure, to $\mu \in \mathcal{M} ((0,1) \times \mathbb{T}^4)$ and $\mu_T = \pi_{\#} \mu $ has a non-trivial absolutely continuous part where $\pi$ is the projection onto the time variable. Moreover, we also show that $\mu$ is close, up to an error measured in $H^{-1}_{t,x}$, to the Duchon--Robert distribution $\mathcal{D}[v_0]$ of the solution to the $4d$ forced Euler equations. Finally, the kinetic energy profile of $v_0$ is smooth in time. Our result relies on a new anomalous dissipation result for the advection--diffusion equation with a divergence free $3d$ autonomous velocity field and the study of the $3+\frac{1}{2} $ dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. This study motivates some open problems.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase high frequency solutions to Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations in Lorenz gauge in (3+1) Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a 1-parameter family (A{\lambda}, {\Phi}{\lambda}){\lambda} of multi-phase high frequency solutions to Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations in Lorenz gauge in the (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. This family is based on an initial ansatz. We prove that for {\lambda} small enough the family of solutions exists on an interval uniform in {\lambda} only function of the initial ansatz. These solutions are close to an approximate solution constructed by geometric optics. The initial ansatz needs to be regular enough, to satisfy a polarization condition and to satisfy the constraints for Maxwell null-transport in Lorenz gauge, but there is no need for smallness of any kind. The phases need to interact in a coherent way. We also observe that the limit (A0, {\Phi}0) is not solution to Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations but to a Klein-Gordon-Maxwell null-transport type system.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical limit for Klein-Gordon equation toward relativistic Euler equations via an adapted modulated energy method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the convergence of the solutions to the massive nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation toward solutions to a relativistic Euler with potential type system in the semi-classical limit. In particular, the momentum and the density of Klein-Gordon converge to the the momentum and the density of the relativistic Euler system in Lebesgue norms. The relativistic Euler with potential is equivalent to the usual relativistic Euler with pressure up to a rescaling. The proof relies on the modulated energy method adapted to the wave equation and the relativistic setting: a modulated stress-energy method.</description>

      <title>Fractional $p$-Laplace systems with critical Hardy nonlinearities: Existence and Multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded open set containing zero, $s \in (0,1)$ and $p \in (1, \infty)$. In this paper, we first deal with the existence, non-existence and some properties of ground-state solutions for the following class of fractional $p$-Laplace systems \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s u= \frac{\alpha}{q} \frac{|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}}{|x|^m} \;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s v= \frac{\beta}{q} \frac{|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}}{|x|^m}\;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;u=v=0\, \mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^d\setminus \Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $d&gt;sp$, $\alpha + \beta = q$ where $p \leq q \leq p_{s}^{*}(m)$ where $p_{s}^{*}(m) = \frac{p(d-m)}{d-sp}$ with $0 \leq m \le sp$. Additionally, we establish a concentration-compactness principle related to this homogeneous system of equations. Next, the main objective of this paper is to study the following non-homogenous system of equations \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s u = \eta |u|^{r-2}u + \gamma \frac{\alpha}{p_{s}^{*}(m)} \frac{|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}}{|x|^m} \;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s v = \eta |v|^{r-2}v + \gamma \frac{\beta}{p^{*}_{s}(m)} \frac{|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}}{|x|^m}\;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;u=v=0\, \mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^d\setminus \Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $\eta, \gamma &gt; 0$ are parameters and $p \leq r &lt; p_{s}^{*}(0)$. Depending on the values of $\eta, \gamma$, we obtain the existence of a non semi-trivial solution with the least energy. Further, for $m=0$, we establish that the above problem admits at least $\text{cat}_{\Omega}({\Omega})$ nontrivial solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a solute-solvent-structure mutually coupled system of equations given by an Oldroyd-type model for a two-dimensional dilute corotational polymer fluid with solute diffusion and damping that is interacting with a one-dimensional viscoelastic shell. Firstly, we give the rate at which its solution decays exponentially in time to the equilibrium solution, independent of the choice of the initial datum. Secondly, as the polymer relaxation time goes to infinity (or, equivalently, the center-of mass diffusion goes to zero), we show that any family of strong solutions of the system described above, that is parametrized by the relaxation time, converges to an essentially bounded weak solution of a corotational polymer fluid-structure interaction system whose solute evolves according to the convected time derivative of its extra stress tensor. A consequence of this is a weak-strong uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the Majda-Biello system in the resonant case on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the following Majda-Biello system in the case $\alpha=4$, where the resonance effect is the most significant, on the real line. \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl}
  u_{t} + u_{xxx} &amp; = &amp; - v v_x,
  v_{t} + \alpha v_{xxx} &amp; = &amp; - (uv)_{x},
  (u,v)|_{t=0} &amp; = &amp; (u_0,v_0) \in H^{s}(\mathbb{R}) \times H^{s}(\mathbb{R}), \end{array} \right. \quad x \in \mathbb{R}, \, t \in \mathbb{R}. \] For Sobolev regularity $s\in[\frac34, 1)$, we establish global well-posedness by refining the I-method. Previously, the critical index for local well-posedness was known to be $\frac34$, while global well-posedness was only obtained for $s\geq 1$. Our global well-posedness result bridges the gap and matches the threshold in the local theory. The main novelty of our approach is to introduce a pair of distinct $I$-operators, tailored to the resonant structure of the Majda-Biello system with $\alpha=4$. This dual-operator framework allows for pointwise control of the multipliers in the modified energies constructed via the multilinear correction technique. These modified energies are almost conserved and provide effective control over the Sobolev norm of the solution for all time. This new approach has potential applications to other coupled dispersive systems exhibiting strong resonant interactions.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of weak solutions for the following quasilinear elliptic system: \[ \begin{cases} -\mathrm{div}(A_1(x,u_1)\nabla u_1) + \displaystyle\frac{1}{2} D_{u_1}A_1(x,u_1)\nabla u_1 \cdot \nabla u_1 = \lambda_1 u_1 + g_{\beta,1}(u) &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\[3mm] -\mathrm{div}(A_2(x,u_2)\nabla u_2) + \displaystyle\frac{1}{2} D_{u_2}A_2(x,u_2)\nabla u_2 \cdot \nabla u_2 = \lambda_2 u_2 + g_{\beta,2}(u) &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\[2mm] u_1 = u_2 = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega, \end{cases} \] where $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 &lt; \mu_1$, the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian, and $\Omega$ is a bounded domain. The nonlinearity derives from a potential $G_\beta$ with subcritical growth.
  Due to the lack of differentiability of the associated energy functional, we employ nonsmooth critical point theory and variational methods based on the concept of weak slope. We prove the existence of least energy solutions in both the cooperative ($\beta &gt; 0$) and competitive ($\beta &lt; 0$) regimes.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Monotone Analysis for a Coupled Sublinear Lane--Emden--Fowler System on Bounded Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14246v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a coupled system of elliptic equations of Lane--Emden--Fowler type on a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ ($n \geq 1$) with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The system is characterized by sublinear power-law reaction terms $0 &lt; \alpha, \beta &lt; 1$ and includes a fidelity regularization component. Due to the non-gradient structure of the coupling, we employ the method of sub- and supersolutions and a monotone iteration scheme to establish the existence of positive solutions. We prove that the system admits a unique positive solution $(u,v) \in C^{1,\gamma}(% \overline{\Omega}) \times C^{1,\gamma}(\overline{\Omega})$ for some $\gamma \in (0,1)$, and we demonstrate the continuous dependence of the solution on the data. For the discrete case, we establish the monotone convergence of a fixed-point algorithm by verifying the conditions of Krasnosel'ski\u{\i}'s theorem for monotone sub-homogeneous operators. This work provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for coupled reaction-diffusion models where traditional variational minimization is not directly applicable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a two-component generalization of the Novikov equation with cubic nonlinearity -- an integrable system whose solutions may develop strong nonlinear phenomena such as gradient blow-up and interactions between peakon-like structures. Our study has two main objectives: first, to analyze the generic regularity of global conservative solutions; and second, to construct a new metric that guarantees the Lipschitz continuity of the flow. Building on the geometric framework developed by Bressan and Chen for quasilinear second-order wave equations, we prove that the solution retains $C^k$ regularity away from a finite number of piecewise $C^{k-1}$ characteristic curves. Furthermore, we provide a description of the solution behavior in the vicinity of these curves. By introducing a Finsler norm on tangent vectors in the space of solutions, expressed in the transformed Bressan-Constantin variables, we introduce a Lipschitz metric representing the minimal energy transportation cost between two solutions.</description>

      <title>Travelling Waves in a Mathematical Model for Oncolytic Virotherapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) is a promising cancer treatment strategy in which engineered viruses selectively infect and destroy tumor cells. Motivated by the biological mechanisms underlying viral spread and tumor invasion into the tissue, we analyze a non-cooperative reaction-diffusion model capturing the invasion of tumor tissue by oncolytic viruses. Using carefully constructed upper and lower solutions together with Schauder's fixed point theorem, we establish the existence of positive travelling-wave solutions. In particular, we identify a minimal wave speed value $\bar c$ such that positive travelling waves exist for all $c \geq \bar c$ . Our analysis also highlights parameter regions where the existence of travelling waves remains ambiguous, suggesting new mathematical questions about the propagation of viral treatments through tumor environments.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of solutions of parabolic equations related to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the log-concavity of the kernel for the parabolic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator in a bounded, convex domain. Consequently, we get the preservation of the log-concavity of the initial datum by the related flow. As an application, we give another proof of a Brunn-Minkowski type inequality for the first eigenvalue of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator and of the log-concavity of the related first eigenfunction (both results have been proved in [9], by different methods).</description>

      <title>Local smoothing estimates for bilinear Fourier integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a local smoothing conjecture for bilinear Fourier integral operators in every dimension $d \ge 2,$ derived from the celebrated linear case due to Sogge, which we refer to as the \emph{bilinear smoothing conjecture}. We show that the linear local smoothing conjecture implies this bilinear version. As a consequence of our approach and due to the recent progress on the subject, we establish local smoothing estimates for Fourier integral operators in dimension $d=2,$ that is, on $\mathbb{R}^2_x \times \mathbb{R}_t$. Also, a partial progress is presented for the high-dimensional case $d\geq 3.$ In particular, our method allows us to deduce that the bilinear local smoothing conjecture holds for all odd dimensions $d$.</description>

      <title>Stability of the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e inequality for the Lebesgue and Gaussian probability measures with explicit geometric dependence and applications to spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain stability results for the $L^p$-Poincar\'e inequality for both Lebesgue and Gaussian probability measures (Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.12) that involve explicit dependence on the geometry of the domain. As a byproduct, the explicit constant allows us to recover an important result of Yu, Zhong and Smits (Corollary 3.8), related to the fundamental gap conjecture of the Laplacian (resolved by Andrews and Clutterbuck), thereby providing an alternative proof. Moreover, we extend this spectral gap result to the $p$-Laplacian (Corollary 3.6). Our approach relies on properties of the first eigenfunction of the (Gaussian) $p$ Laplacian operator and weighted Poincar\'e inequalities for log-concave measures on convex domains.</description>

      <title>Weak-strong uniqueness for bi-fluid compressible system with algebraic closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a real two-fluid system of compressible viscous fluids with a common velocity field and algebraic closure for the pressure law. The constitutive relation involves densities of both fluids through an implicit function. The existence of global-in-time finite energy weak solutions to this system is known since the work of Novotn\'{y} and Pokorn\'{y} [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 2020]. On the other hand, existence of local-in-time strong solutions is due to Piasecki and Zatorska [J. Math Fluid Mech., 2022]. In this paper, we establish the weak-strong uniqueness principle using the relative entropy method. In sharp contrast to the two-phase model of Baer-Nunziato type, the volume fraction of phase $+$ obeys a transport equation with an additional nonlinear term. This gives rise to troublesome terms in the relative entropy inequality. We are able to close the estimate by making an elaborate use of the structure of the system.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of symmetric flows with viscous inflow boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a channel $\Omega=(0,L)\times(0,H)$ with small viscosity $\varepsilon\ll1$, an $\varepsilon$-Navier slip condition on the horizontal walls, and a viscous inflow condition for the perturbation stream function. For a broad class of symmetric base profiles $u_0(y)$ vanishing on the walls, we construct an exact steady solution $(u_s,v_s)$ that is $O(\varepsilon^{1/3})$-close to the shear $(u_0,0)$. We then develop a new weighted vorticity energy method to prove uniform linear stability and exponential decay: perturbations decay exponentially in a weighted $L^2$ norm on the time scale $O(\varepsilon^{-1/3})$. In the short-channel regime $L\ll1$, the method yields nonlinear asymptotic stability with threshold $O(\varepsilon^{2/3})$. In the long-channel regime, assuming concavity together with a spectral condition, we introduce a quantity \textit{Rayleigh vorticity} to control the non-favorable terms and obtain nonlinear stability with threshold $O(\varepsilon^{5/6+})$.</description>

      <title>Derivation of variational membrane models in the context of anisotropic nonlocal hyperelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the analysis of thin structures, we study the variational dimension reduction of hyperelastic energies involving nonlocal gradients to an effective membrane model. When rescaling the thin domain, isotropic interaction ranges naturally become anisotropic, leading to the development of a theory for anisotropic nonlocal gradients with direction-dependent interaction ranges. Unlike existing nonlocal derivatives with finite horizon, which are defined via interaction kernels supported on balls of positive radius, our formulation is based on ellipsoidal interaction regions whose principal radii may vanish independently. This yields a unified framework that interpolates between fully nonlocal, partially nonlocal, and purely local models. Employing these tools, we present a $\Gamma$-convergence analysis for the nonlocal thin-film energies. The limit functional retains the structural form of the classical membrane energy, and the classical local model is recovered precisely when all interaction radii vanish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Hardy spaces for Fourier integral operators to obtain bounds for spherical maximal functions in $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, $n\geq2$, where the radii of the spheres are restricted to a compact interval in $(0,\infty)$. These bounds extend to general hypersurfaces with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, to the complex spherical means, and to geodesic spheres on compact manifolds. We also obtain improved maximal function bounds and pointwise convergence statements for wave equations, both on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and on compact manifolds. The maximal function bounds are essentially sharp for all $p\in[1,2]\cup [\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1},\infty)$, for each such hypersurface, every complex spherical mean, and on every manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for turning a numerical simulation of a gap soliton in the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation into a rigorous mathematical proof of its existence. These nonlinear localized solutions play a central role in the study of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We reformulate the problem of proving their existence as the search for homoclinic orbits in a dynamical system. We then apply computer-assisted proof techniques to obtain verifiable conditions under which a numerically approximated trajectory corresponds to a true homoclinic orbit. This work also presents the first examples of computer-assisted proofs of gap solitons in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on non-perturbative parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Cohomology for linearized Ricci curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish solvability and uniqueness conditions for the linearized Ricci curvature equations on compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary, obtained without imposing restrictions on the interior geometry. The proof recasts the problem in cohomological terms by means of a generalized Hodge theory, based on the Boutet de Monvel calculus. The first cohomology, obstructing uniqueness, is always finite dimensional, whereas the second cohomology, obstructing solvability, is finite dimensional if the boundary is empty or the dimension is three. Through the Bochner technique, we prove vanishing theorems for these cohomologies; for the second cohomology, the argument also uses stress potentials and the sharp Poincar\'e inequality on spheres.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Galerkin Method and Hierarchical Preconditioning for PDE-constrained Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop efficient hierarchical preconditioners for optimal control problems governed by partial differential equations with uncertain coefficients. Adopting a discretize-then-optimize framework that integrates finite element discretization, stochastic Galerkin projection, and advanced time-discretization schemes, the approach addresses challenges of scaling large and ill-conditioned linear systems arising in uncertainty quantification. By exploiting sparsity of linear systems in stochastic Galerkin method, we formulate hierarchical preconditioners based on truncated stochastic expansion that strike an effective balance between computational cost and preconditioning quality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed preconditioners significantly accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers compared to existing methods, providing robust and efficient solvers for both steady-state and time-dependent optimal control problems under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>On the Numerical Treatment of an Abstract Nonlinear System of Coupled Hyperbolic Equations Associated with the Timoshenko Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work addresses the Cauchy problem for an abstract nonlinear system of coupled hyperbolic equations associated with the Timoshenko model in a real Hilbert space. Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>
