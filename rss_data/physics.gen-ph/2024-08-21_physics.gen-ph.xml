      <title>Entanglement and Generalized Berry Geometrical Phases in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new formalism is introduced describe the physical and geometric content of quantum spacetime. It is based in the Minimum Group Representation Principle. New results for entanglement and geometrical/topological phases are found and implemented in cosmological and black hole space-times. Our main results here are: (i) The Berry phases for inflation, for the cosmological perturbations, and its expression in terms of observables, as the spectral scalar and tensor indices, $n_S$ an $n_T$, and their ratio $r$. The Berry phase for de Sitter inflation is imaginary, its sign describing the exponential acceleration. (ii) The pure entangled states in the minimum group (metaplectic) $Mp(n)$ representation for quantum de Sitter space-time and black holes are found. (iii) For entanglement, the relation between the Schmidt type representation and the physical states of the $Mp(n)$ group is found: This is a new non-diagonal coherent state representation complementary to the known Sudarshan diagonal one. (iv) The mean $Mp(2)$ generator values are related to the space-time topological charge. (v) The basic even and odd $n$ -sectors of the Hilbert space are intrinsic to the quantum spacetime and its discrete levels (continuum for $n \rightarrow \infty$) and are it entangled. (vi) The gravity or cosmological domains on one side and another of the Planck scale are entangled. Examples: The primordial quantum trans-Planckian de Sitter vacuum and the late classical gravity de Sitter vacuum today; the central quantum reqion and the external classical region of black holes. The classical and quantum dual gravity regions of the space-time are entangled. (vii) The general classical-quantum gravity duality is associated to the Metaplectic $Mp(n)$ group symmetry which provides the complete full covering of the phase space and of the quantum space-time mapped from it.</description>

      <title>Finite mathematics as the most general (fundamental) mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explain at the simplest possible level why finite mathematics based on a finite ring of characteristic $p$ is more general (fundamental) than standard mathematics. The belief of most mathematicians and physicists that standard mathematics is the most fundamental arose for historical reasons. However, simple {\it mathematical} arguments show that standard mathematics (involving the concept of infinities) is a degenerate case of finite mathematics in the formal limit $p\to\infty$: standard mathematics arises from finite mathematics in the degenerate case when operations modulo a number are discarded. Quantum theory based on a finite ring of characteristic $p$ is more general than standard quantum theory because the latter is a degenerate case of the former in the formal limit $p\to\infty$.</description>
