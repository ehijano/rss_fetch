      <title>Density functional Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory for superconductors implemented in the SIESTA code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SIESTA-BdG, an implementation of the simultaneous solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) problem in SIESTA, a first-principles method and code for material simulations which uses pseudopotentials and a localized basis set. This unified approach describes both conventional and unconventional superconducting states, and enables a description of inhomogeneous superconductors and heterostructures. We demonstrate the validity, accuracy, and efficiency of SIESTA-BdG by computing physically relevant quantities (superconducting charge density, band structure, superconducting gap features, density of states) for conventional singlet (Nb, Pb) and unconventional (FeSe) superconductors. We find excellent agreement with experiments and results obtained within the KKR-BdG computational framework. SIESTA-BdG forms the basis for modelling quantum transport in superconducting devices and including - in an approximate fashion - the superconducting DFT potential of Oliveira, Gross, and Kohn.</description>

      <title>Fermion-fermion interaction driven phase transitions in the rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of the rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated by virtue of the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With the help of the detailed numerical analysis, we notice that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct kinds of fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$ and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. Such fixed points principally dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime, which are always associated with some instabilities with specific symmetry breakings and thus accompanied by certain phase transitions. In order to judge the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we bring out a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, it is determined that the dominant states correspond to a spin-singlet superconductivity, a spin-triplet pair-density-wave, and a spin-triplet superconductivity for approaching the fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These results would be helpful to further reveal the low-energy properties of the rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum colored strings in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stripe phase, an intertwined order observed in high-temperature superconductors, is regarded as playing a key role in elucidating the underlying mechanism of superconductivity, especially in cuprates. Following Jan Zaanen's early scenario, the full-filled charge stripe can be taken as the interactive elastic quantum strings of holes, stabilized by $\pi$-phase shifts between neighboring magnetic domains. However, this scenario is challenging to explain, particularly in terms of electron pairing, which necessitates hole pairs. In this work, we propose a new effective model for describing the stripe phase in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model. With respect to the antiferromagnetic background, the model comprises three types of color-labeled point-defects coupling to {an effective} spin field. Comparing with numerical results from large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find semi-quantitative agreement in local hole density, magnetic moment, and the newly proposed spectrum features of the {effective} spin field. By systematically analyzing the hole-density distribution and the scaling of groundstate energy at different system sizes, we determine the effective core radius and the effective hopping amplitude of the quantum string. Furthermore, the local pinning field can be finely adjusted to drag the quantum string, offering a potential method for detecting it in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers with intrinsic separation of pump and signal tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers achieve ultra-low-noise amplification through the nonlinear kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. One of the main challenges to the operation of these devices is the separation of the strong pump tone from the signal tone after amplification has been achieved. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a pump separation method based on operating a half-wave superconducting resonator amplifier behind a cryogenic circulator. Our pump separation scheme does not involve post-amplification interference, and thereby avoids the delicate phase matching of two different pump paths. We demonstrate the scheme using two-port half-wave resonator amplifiers based on superconducting NbN thin-films. We present measurements of gain profiles and degrees of pump separation for amplifiers having different coupling quality factors. On an amplifier having a coupling quality factor of $\sim2000$, we measured a peak signal gain of $15\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst achieving pump separation of $12\,\mathrm{dB}$. The amplifier was stable for continuous measurements, and the gain drift was measured to be $0.15\,\mathrm{dB}$ over an hour. The same amplifier was operated at $3.2\,\mathrm{K}$ and achieved a peak signal gain of $11\,\mathrm{dB}$ whilst having a pump separation factor of $10.5\,\mathrm{dB}$. The pump separation scheme, and these promising results, will advance the development of superconducting resonator amplifiers as an important technology in quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Superconducting magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene hosts competing magnetic order and moir\'e inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic mechanism of superconductivity in the magic-angle twisted graphene family, including magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG), is poorly understood. Properties of MATTG, like Pauli limit violation, suggest unconventional superconductivity. Theoretical studies propose proximal magnetic states in the phase diagram, but direct experimental evidence is lacking. We show direct evidence for an in-plane magnetic order proximal to the superconducting state using two complementary electrical transport measurements. First, we probe the superconducting phase by using statistically significant switching events from superconducting to the dissipative state of MATTG. The system behaves like a network of Josephson junctions due to lattice relaxation-induced moir\'e inhomogeneity in the system. We observe non-monotonic and hysteretic responses in the switching distributions as a function of temperature and in-plane magnetic field. Second, in normal regions doped slightly away from the superconducting regime, we observe hysteresis in magnetoresistance with an in-plane magnetic field; showing evidence for in-plane magnetic order that vanishes $\sim$900 mK. Additionally, we show a broadened Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition due to relaxation-induced moir\'e inhomogeneity. We find superfluid stiffness $J_{\mathrm{s}}$$\sim$0.15 K with strong temperature dependence. Theoretically, the magnetic and superconducting order arising from the magnetic order's fluctuations have been proposed - we show direct evidence for both. Our observation that the hysteretic magnetoresistance is sensitive to the in-plane field may constrain possible intervalley-coherent magnetic orders and the resulting superconductivity that arises from its fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higgs modes emerge in superconductors as collective excitations of the order parameter amplitude when periodically driven by electromagnetic radiation. In this work, we develop a Floquet approach to study Higgs modes in superconductors under time-periodic driving, where the dynamics of the order parameter is captured by anomalous Floquet Green's functions. We show that the Floquet description is particularly powerful as it allows one to exploit the time-periodic nature of the driving, thus considerably reducing the complexity of the time-dependent problem. Interestingly, the Floquet approach is also enlightening because it naturally offers a physical explanation for the renormalized steady-state order parameter as a result of photon processes between Floquet sidebands. We demonstrate the usefulness of Floquet engineering Higgs modes in time-periodic $s$-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Case studies on time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations for superconducting applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The macroscopic electromagnetic properties of type II superconductors are primarily influenced by the behavior of microscopic superconducting flux quantum units. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations provide an elegant and powerful tool for describing and examining both the statics and dynamics of these superconducting entities. They have been instrumental in replicating and elucidating numerous experimental results over the past decades.This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the progress in TDGL simulations, focusing on three key aspects of superconductor applications. The initial section delves into vortex rectification in superconductors described within the TDGL framework. We specifically highlight the superconducting diode effect achieved through asymmetric pinning landscapes and the reversible manipulation of vortex ratchets with dynamic pinning landscapes. The subsequent section reviews the achievements of TDGL simulations concerning the critical current density of superconductors, emphasizing the optimization of pinning sites, particularly vortex pinning and dynamics in polycrystalline Nb$_3$Sn with grain boundaries. The third part concentrates on numerical modeling of vortex penetration and dynamics in superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities, including a discussion of superconductor insulator superconductor multilayer structures. In the last section, we present key findings, insights, and perspectives derived from the discussed simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of nonunitary triplet superconductors: application to UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that the heavy fermion material UTe$_2$ is a spin-triplet superconductor, possibly manifesting time-reversal symmetry breaking, as measured by Kerr effect and muon spin resonance experiments below the critical temperature, in some samples. Such signals can arise due to a chiral orbital state, or possible nonunitary pairing. Although experiments at low $T$ appear to be consistent with point nodes in the spectral gap, the detailed form of the order parameter and even the nodal positions are not yet determined. Thermal conductivity measurements can extend to quite low temperatures, with varying heat current direction can therefore provide information on the order parameter structure. Here we derive a general expression for the thermal conductivity of a spin triplet superconductor, and use it to compare the low-temperature behavior of various states proposed for UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Inverse spin-Hall effect and spin-swapping in spin-split superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a spin-splitting field is introduced to a thin film superconductor, the spin currents polarized along the field couples to energy currents that can only decay via inelastic scattering. We study spin and energy injection into such a superconductor where spin-orbit impurity scattering yields inverse spin-Hall and spin-swapping currents. We show that the combined presence of a spin-splitting field, superconductivity, and inelastic scattering gives rise to a strong enhancement of the ordinary inverse spin-Hall effect, as well as unique inverse spin-Hall and spin-swapping signals orders of magnitude stronger than the ordinary inverse spin-Hall signal. These can be completely controlled by the orientation of the spin-splitting field, resulting in a long-range charge and spin accumulations detectable much further from the injector than in the normal-state. While the enhanced inverse spin-Hall signals offer a major improvement in spin detection sensitivity, the unique spin-swap signals can be utilized for designing devices where both the spin and current directions are controlled and altered throughout the geometry.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality of nodal $d$-wave superconductivity, N\'eel order, and charge order on the square lattice at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a SU(2) lattice gauge theory on the square lattice, with a single fundamental complex fermion and a single fundamental complex boson on each lattice site. Projective symmetries of the gauge-charged fermions are chosen so that they match with those of the spinons of the $\pi$-flux spin liquid. Global symmetries of all gauge-invariant observables are chosen to match with those of the particle-hole symmetric electronic Hubbard model at half-filling. Consequently, both the fundamental fermion and fundamental boson move in an average background $\pi$-flux, their gauge-invariant composite is the physical electron, and eliminating gauge fields in a strong gauge-coupling expansion yields an effective extended Hubbard model for the electrons. The SU(2) gauge theory displays several confining/Higgs phases: a nodal $d$-wave superconductor, and states with N\'eel, valence-bond solid, charge, or staggered current orders. There are also a number of quantum phase transitions between these phases which are very likely described by 2+1 dimensional deconfined conformal gauge theories, and we present large flavor expansions for such theories. These include the phenomenologically attractive case of a transition between a conventional insulator with a charge gap and N\'eel order, and a conventional $d$-wave superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles at 4 nodal points in the Brillouin zone. We also apply our approach to the honeycomb lattice, where we find a bicritical point at the junction of N\'eel, valence bond solid (Kekul\'e), and Dirac semi-metal phases.</description>

      <title>Investigation of spin excitations and charge order in bulk crystals of the infinite-layer nickelate LaNiO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent x-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed spin excitations and charge density waves in thin films of infinite-layer (IL) nickelates. However, clarifying whether the origin of these phenomena is intrinsic to the material class or attributable to impurity phases in the films has presented a major challenge. Here we utilize topotactic methods to synthesize bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$ with crystallographically oriented surfaces. We examine these crystals using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ni $L_3$-edge to elucidate the spin and charge correlations in the bulk of the material. While we detect the presence of prominent spin excitations in the crystals, fingerprints of charge order are absent at the ordering vectors identified in previous in thin-film studies. These results contribute to the understanding of the bulk properties of LaNiO$_2$ and establish topotactically synthesized crystals as viable complementary specimens for spectroscopic investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of electronic correlation effect [M. Corasaniti \textit{et al}., Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, L121112 (2021)] and topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations [N. Drucker \textit{et al}., Nat. Commun. \textbf{14}, 5182 (2023)] in the noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate CeAlGe, we performed systematic studies on the local static and dynamic spin susceptibilities by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance. Due to the large spin susceptibility from Ce-$4f$ electrons, the theoretically predicted responses from Weyl fermions are overwhelmed. A Knight-shift anomaly is observed below $T^*\sim50$ K, a signature of the onset of coherent Kondo coupling. In addition, an anomalous peak is found in $1/T_1T$ near 15 K, well above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_N \approx 5$ K, which probably is a consequence of topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations. These results highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, magnetism and band topology in this family of Kondo Weyl semimetals.</description>
