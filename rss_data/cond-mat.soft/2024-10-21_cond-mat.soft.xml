      <title>Explosive rigidity percolation in origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami, the traditional art of paper folding, has revolutionized science and technology in recent years and has been found useful in various real-world applications. In particular, origami-inspired structures have been utilized for robotics and mechanical information storage, in both of which the rigidity control of origami plays a crucial role. However, most prior works have only considered the origami design problem using purely deterministic or stochastic approaches. In this paper, we study the rigidity control of origami using the idea of explosive percolation. Specifically, to turn a maximally floppy origami structure into a maximally rigid origami structure, one can combine a random sampling process of origami facets and some simple selection rules, which allow us to exploit the power of choices and significantly accelerate or delay the rigidity percolation transition. We further derive simple formulas that connect the rigidity percolation transition effects with the origami pattern size and the number of choices, thereby providing an effective way to determine the optimal number of choices for achieving prescribed rigidity percolation transition accuracy and sharpness. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the rigidity control of mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Additive design of 2-dimensional scissor lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an additive approach for the design of a class of transformable structures based on two-bar linkages ("scissor mechanisms") joined at vertices to form a two dimensional lattice. Our discussion traces an underlying mathematical similarity between linkage mechanisms, origami, and kirigami and inspires our name for these structures: karigami. We show how to design karigami which unfold from a one dimensional collapsed state to two-dimensional surfaces of single and double curvature. Our algorithm for growing karigami structures is provably complete in providing the ability to explore the full space of possible mechanisms, and we use it to computationally design and physically realize a series of examples of varying complexity.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced transitions from contractile to extensile active stress in isotropic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tissues of living cells are a prime example of active fluids. There is experimental evidence that tissues generate extensile active stress even though their constituting cells are contractile. Fluctuating forces that could result from cell-substrate interactions have been proposed to be able to induce a transition from contractile to extensile active stress. Through analytic calculations and numerical computations, we show that in isotropic active fluids, nonlinearities and a coupling between fluctuating forces and fluid density are necessary for such a transition to occur. Here, both transitions from extensile to contractile and vice versa are possible.</description>

      <title>Experimental studies on collision between self-propelling liquid crystal droplets in quasi-two-dimensional geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active droplets undergoing micellar solubilization can self-propel themselves by emitting filled micelles from their surface and are by nature anti-chemotactic. These droplets get repelled by their own trail of filled micelles or by other neighbouring droplets. We experimentally study the various types of scattering events between two such active droplets. We define different collision parameters to characterize the scattering events and monitor the time evolution of these parameters about the closest approach between the droplets. For generic oblique collisions of the droplets, we find four major types of scattering events in our experimental studies depending on the initial angle of approach, the initial Peclet numbers, the delay time, and the initial distance between the droplets. For higher Peclet number droplets, the existence of a bound state was also found.</description>

      <title>Onset and impact of plastic deformation in granular compaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of plastic deformation in the high-pressure compaction of granular material is investigated using bonded particle model simulations. Grains are discretized into a set of computational particles connected by pairwise bonds. Bonds are harmonic up to a plastic onset strain $\epsilon_p$ above which they yield, capping out at a maximum force and producing an elastic-perfectly-plastic-like mechanical response in grains. Packings containing over one thousand monodisperse spherical grains are isotropically compacted to different packing fractions to quantify how decreasing $\epsilon_p$ softens the rise in pressure and impacts effective elastic properties of the confined system. By isolating the relative decrease in pressure due to plasticity, we find data can be collapsed across a wide range of values of $\epsilon_p$ suggesting that relatively simple mathematical descriptions may capture plasticity's effect in granular compaction. Lastly, we study the microscopic statistics of local strains in grains and connect their evolution to the observed macroscopic behavior.</description>

      <title>Impact of the electrode material on the performance of light-emitting electrochemical cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are promising candidates for fully solution-processed lighting applications because they can comprise a single active-material layer and air-stable electrodes. While their performance is often claimed to be independent of the electrode material selection due to the in-situ formation of electric double layers (EDLs), we demonstrate conceptually and experimentally that this understanding needs to be modified. Specifically, the exciton generation zone is observed to be affected by the electrode work function. We rationalize this finding by proposing that the ion concentration in the injection-facilitating EDLs depends on the offset between the electrode work function and the respective semiconductor orbital, which in turn influences the number of ions available for electrochemical doping and hence shifts the exciton generation zone. Further, we investigate the effects of the electrode selection on exciton losses to surface plasmon polaritons and discuss the impact of cavity effects on the exciton density. We conclude by showing that the measured electrode-dependent LEC luminance transients can be replicated by an optical model that considers these electrode-dependent effects to calculate the attained light outcoupling of the LEC stack. As such, our findings provide rational design criteria considering the electrode materials, the active-material thickness, and its composition in concert to achieve optimum LEC performance.</description>

      <title>Impacts of packed bed polydispersity and deformation on fine particle transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static granular packings play a central role in numerous industrial applications and natural settings. In these situations, fluid or fine particle flow through a bed of static particles is heavily influenced by the narrowest passage connecting the pores of the packing, commonly referred to as pore throats or constrictions. Existing studies predominantly assume monodisperse rigid particles, but this is an oversimplification of the problem. In this work, we illustrate the connection between pore throat size, polydispersity, and particle deformation. Simple analytical expressions are provided to link these properties of the packing, followed by examples from Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of fine particle percolation demonstrating the impact of polydispersity and particle deformation. Our intent is to emphasize the substantial impact of polydispersity and particle deformation on constriction size, underscoring the importance of accounting for these effects in particle transport in granular packings.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric limit cycles within Lorenz chaos induce anomalous mobility for a memory-driven active particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On applying a small bias force, non-equilibrium systems may respond in paradoxical ways such as with giant negative mobility (GNM) -- a large net drift opposite to the applied bias, or giant positive mobility (GPM) -- an anomalously large drift in the same direction as the applied bias. Such behaviors have been extensively studied in idealized models of externally driven passive inertial particles. Here, we consider a minimal model of a memory-driven active particle inspired from experiments with walking and superwalking droplets, whose equation of motion maps to the celebrated Lorenz system. By adding a small bias force to this Lorenz model for the active particle, we uncover a dynamical mechanism for simultaneous emergence of GNM and GPM in the parameter space. Within the chaotic sea of the parameter space, a symmetric pair of coexisting asymmetric limit cycles separate and migrate under applied bias force, resulting in anomalous transport behaviors that are sensitive to the active particle's memory. Our work highlights a general dynamical mechanism for the emergence of anomalous transport behaviors for active particles described by low-dimensional nonlinear models.</description>

      <title>Growth and shrinkage of tissue sheets on substrates: buds, buckles, and pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many tissues take the form of thin sheets, being only a single cell thick, but millions of cells wide. These tissue sheets can bend and buckle in the third dimension. In this work, we investigated the growth and shrinkage of suspended and supported tissue sheets using particle-based simulations. We construct a minimum model, combining particle-based tissue growth and meshless membrane models, to simulate the growth of tissue sheets with mechanical feedback. Free suspended growing tissues exhibit wrinkling when growth is sufficiently fast. Conversely, tissues on a substrate form buds when the adhesion to the substrate is weak and/or when the friction with the substrate is strong. These buds undergo a membrane-mediated attraction and subsequently fuse. The complete detachment of tissues from the substrate and straight buckled bump formation are also obtained at very weak adhesion and/or fast growth rates. In the tissue shrinkage, tissue pores grow via Ostwald ripening and coalescence. The reported dynamics can also be applied in research on the detachment dynamics of different tissues with weakened adhesion.</description>
