      <title>Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$, where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a local superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We present how this scenario can fit most of the available data and propose additional experimental tests which can distinguish our proposal from the Meissner flux exclusion scenario. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. More broadly, this work provides a new mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coulomb drag mediated by cotunneling of fluxons and Cooper pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict two novel quantum drag effects which can occur in macroscopically quantum coherent Josephson circuits. We demonstrate that biasing one resistively shunted Josephson junction by an external current one can induce a non-zero voltage drop across another such junction capacitively coupled to the first one. This quantum Coulomb drag is caused by cotunneling of magnetic flux quanta across both junctions which remain in the "superconducting" regime. Likewise, Cooper pair cotunneling across a pair of connected in series Josephson junctions in the "insulating" regime is responsible for another -- dual -- quantum Coulomb drag effect.</description>

      <title>Evolution of pairing symmetry in {\FSS} as probed by uniaxial-strain tuning of $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), the interplay between electronic nematicity and superconductivity is essential for understanding the exotic superconducting ground state. In the nematic regime, uniaxial-strain ($\varepsilon$) tuning of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ [$\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)=\alpha\varepsilon+\beta\varepsilon^2$] offers a unique approach to investigating the evolution of pairing symmetry if both $s$ and $d$ wave pairing instabilities are relevant. Here, we employ uniaxial strain to tune the $T_c$ of {\FSS}, in which both nematicity and superconductivity undergo significant changes with doping. While $T_c$ is usually suppressed quadratically with $\varepsilon$ in optimally doped {\BFA}, $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)$ in {\FSS} dominated by $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)=\beta\varepsilon^2$ changes its sign from $\beta$ &lt; $0$ in FeSe to $\beta$ &gt; $0$ in {\FSS} ($x\gtrsim0.10$), indicating an evolution of the pairing symmetry from an $s_{\pm}$ state towards an $s+d$ wave state. These findings highlight the $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)$ as a powerful probe for elucidating the superconducting pairing symmetry in the nematic regime of FeSCs and provide new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry in FeSCs.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Digital Image Correlation as a Probe of Strain in Iron-Based Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniaxial strain is a powerful tuning parameter that can control symmetry and anisotropic electronic properties in iron-based superconductors. However, accurately characterizing anisotropic strain can be challenging and complex. Here, we utilize a cryogenic optical system equipped with a high-spatial-resolution microscope to characterize surface strains in iron-based superconductors using the digital image correlation method. Compared with other methods such as high-resolution X-ray diffraction, strain gauge, and capacitive sensor, digital image correlation offers a non-contact, full-field measurement approach, acting as an optical virtual strain gauge that provides high spatial resolution. The results measured on detwinned {\BFA} are quantitatively consistent with the distortion measured by X-ray diffraction and neutron Larmor diffraction. These findings highlight the potential of cryogenic digital image correlation as an effective and accessible tool for probing the isotropic and anisotropic strains, facilitating the application of uniaxial strain tuning in the study of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Suppressed paramagnetism in amorphous Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ oxides and its link to superconducting qubit performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced transmon qubit $T_1$ coherence times have been linked to the amorphous oxide layers formed by thin film capacitors during processing. Because Ta or Ta capped Nb capacitors exhibit overall superior qubit performance to those fabricated with Nb capacitors, it has been hypothesized that the amorphous, non-stoichiometric Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ oxide is less lossy than its Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ counterpart. The origins of what makes amorphous Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ less susceptible to accepted decoherence channels is unknown. Here we establish the microscopic features of amorphous Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ and Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ using a combination of \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations. Our simulations establish that oxygen deficiency is less likely to occur in amorphous Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ than in Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ for $0\le x \le 0.25$ and that at a given level of oxygen deficiency the formation of metal Ta-Ta bonds is enhanced. These bonds, which are accommodated by structural flaws in the amorphous network, capture electrons better than in amorphous Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$. These thermochemical differences quench or highly suppress magnetic moments in amorphous Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$ and eliminate a potential source of quasiparticles and magnetic flux noise. Our calculations also show that hyperfine couplings between Nb nuclei and local magnetic moments in Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ could form "two-level systems" (TLS) or "two-level fluctuators" (TLF) with energy splittings of 100-1000 MHz or higher. This reveals a new TLS mechanism in amorphous Nb$_2$O$_{5-x}$ oxide layers that is unlikely in Ta$_2$O$_{5-x}$. Our work provides fundamental understanding of the materials chemistry and limitations imposed by native oxides of superconducting qubits, which can be used to guide materials selection and processing.</description>

      <title>Effects of frequency mixing on Shapiro-step formations in sliding charge-density-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) is driven to slide by a dc electric field, carrying an electric current. In an additional ac field with frequency ${\omega}_{\mathrm{ex}}$, it is known that the sliding CDW can be synchronized to $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$, leading to the occurrence of Shapiro steps in the $I$-$V$ characteristics. Motivated by a recent experiment where ac fields with two frequencies $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}^{\prime}$ are simultaneously applied, we theoretically investigate the effects of frequency mixing on the Shapiro-step formation. Based on the Fukuyama-Lee-Rice model, we show that in addition to the main steps induced by $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$, satellite steps characterized by $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}^{\prime}$ emerge. It is also found that with increasing the ac-field strength for $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}^{\prime}$, each step width first exhibits a damped oscillation as in the one-frequency case, and then, exhibits a non-monotonic behavior. The origin of these behaviors and the relevance to the associated experiment are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Existence of Hebel-Slichter peak in unconventional kagome superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical investigation of the spin susceptibility of unconventional superconductivity on the kagome lattice. Despite the existence of a sign-changing gap structure, which sums to zero over the Fermi surface, we show that such unconventional pairing states may exhibit a Hebel-Slichter peak in the temperature-dependent spin-lattice relaxation rate. It originates from destructive sublattice interference effects. For the same reason, unconventional pairing states on the kagome lattice tend not to exhibit a neutron resonance peak. These results supplement previous theoretical studies of the surprising robustness of sign-changing gap structures to disorder on the kagome lattice. Taken together these findings imply that unconventional superconductivity on the kagome lattice is deceptive in the sense that its properties may appear similar to conventional non-sign-changing superconductivity. These results may be of relevance to the superconducting state of the kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$: K, Rb, Cs) and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect in Quantum Spin Hall Insulator-based Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a magneto-electric phenomenon where an external magnetic field imparts a non-zero center-of-mass momentum to Cooper pairs, either facilitating or hindering the flow of supercurrent depending on its direction. We propose that quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI)-based Josephson junctions can serve as versatile platforms for non-dissipative electronics exhibiting the SDE when triggered by a phase bias and an out-of-plane magnetic field. By computing the contributions from Andreev bound states and the continuum of quasi-particle states, we provide both numerical and analytical results scrutinizing various aspects of the SDE, including its quality Q-factor. The maximum value of the $Q$-factor is found to be universal at low (zero) temperatures, which ties its origin to underlying topological properties that are independent of the junction's specific details. As the magnetic field increases, the SDE diminishes due to the closing of the induced superconducting gap caused by orbital effects. To observe the SDE, the QSHI-based Josephson junction must be designed so that its edges are transport-wise non-equivalent. Additionally, we explore the SDE in a more exotic yet realistic scenario, where the fermionic ground-state parity of the Josephson junction remains conserved while driving a current. In this 4$\pi$-periodic situation, we predict an enhancement of the SDE compared to its 2$\pi$-periodic, parity-unconstrained counterpart.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect in Multiphase Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a new mechanism for the intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) in multiphase superconductors. Using a Ginzburg-Landau and a microscopic two-band model, we find phase transitions into a mixed phase with finite-momentum Cooper pairs and SDE with high (including maximal) diode efficiencies, despite the individual phases exhibiting no SDE and equal inversion parity. We thus show that parity mixing $-$ invoked in previous proposals $-$ is not a crucial ingredient for SDE. The new mechanism may be relevant in a multitude of known multiphase superconductors like UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinetic inductance and superfluid stiffness of two-dimensional superconductors using high-quality transmission-line resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However, their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample, NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Thermoelectric transport has been widely used to study Abrikosov vortex dynamics in unconventional superconductors. However, only a few thermoelectric studies have been conducted near the dimensional crossover that occurs when the vortex-vortex interaction length scale becomes comparable to the sample size. Here we report the effects of finite size on the dissipation mechanisms of the Nernst effect in the optimally doped $\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{CaCu}_{2}\text{O}_{8+x}$ high-temperature superconductor, down to the atomic length limit. To access this regime, we develop a new generation of thermoelectric chips based on silicon nitride microprinted circuit boards. These chips ensure optimized signals while preventing sample deterioration. Our results demonstrate that lateral confinement at the nanoscale can effectively reduce vortex dissipation. Investigating vortex dissipation at the micro- and nano-scale is essential for creating stable, miniaturized superconducting circuits.</description>
