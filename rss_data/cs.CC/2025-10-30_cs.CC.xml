      <title>Geometry Of The Subset Sum Problem -- Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We announce two breakthrough results concerning important questions in the Theory of Computational Complexity. In this expository paper, a systematic and comprehensive geometric characterization of the Subset Sum Problem is presented. We show the existence of a universal geometric structure, comprised of a family of non-decreasing paths in the Cartesian plane, that captures any instance of the problem of size $n$. Inspired by the geometric structure, we provide an unconditional, deterministic and polynomial time algorithm, albeit with fairly high complexity, thereby showing that $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$. Furthermore, our algorithm also outputs the number of solutions to the problem in polynomial time, thus leading to $\mathcal{FP} = \mathcal{\#P}$. As a bonus, one important consequence of our results, out of many, is that the quantum-polynomial class $\mathcal{BQP} \subseteq \mathcal{P}$.
  Not only this, but we show that when multiple solutions exist, they can be placed in certain equivalence classes based on geometric attributes, and be compactly represented by a polynomial sized directed acyclic graph. We show that the Subset Sum Problem has two aspects, namely a combinatorial aspect and a relational aspect, and that it is the latter which is the primary determiner of complexity. We reveal a surprising connection between the size of the elements and their number, and the precise way in which they affect the complexity. In particular, we show that for all instances of the Subset Sum Problem, the complexity is independent of the size of elements, once the difference between consecutive elements exceeds $\lceil{7\log{}n}\rceil$ bits in size.
  We provide some numerical examples to illustrate the algorithm, and also show how it can be used to estimate some difficult combinatorial quantities such as the number of restricted partitions.</description>

      <title>Multiplayer Parallel Repetition Is the Same as High-Dimensional Extremal Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show equivalences between several high-dimensional problems in extremal combinatorics and parallel repetition of multiplayer (multiprover) games over large answer alphabets. This extends the forbidden-subgraph technique, previously studied by Verbitsky (Theoretical Computer Science 1996), Feige and Verbitsy (Combinatorica 2002), and H\k{a}z{\l}a , Holenstein and Rao (2016), to all $k$-player games, and establishes new connections to problems in combinatorics. We believe that these connections may help future progress in both fields.</description>

      <title>Most Juntas Saturate the Hardcore Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a function that is mildly hard for size-$s$ circuits. For sufficiently large $s$, Impagliazzo's hardcore lemma guarantees a constant-density subset of inputs on which the same function is extremely hard for circuits of size $s'&lt;\!\!&lt;s$. Blanc, Hayderi, Koch, and Tan [FOCS 2024] recently showed that the degradation from $s$ to $s'$ in this lemma is quantitatively tight in certain parameter regimes. We give a simpler and more general proof of this result in almost all parameter regimes of interest by showing that a random junta witnesses the tightness of the hardcore lemma with high probability.</description>

      <title>New Limits on Distributed Quantum Advantage: Dequantizing Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we give two results that put new limits on distributed quantum advantage in the context of the LOCAL model of distributed computing. First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\Pi$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.</description>
