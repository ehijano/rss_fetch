      <title>Encoder-Inverter Framework for Seismic Acoustic Impedance Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic acoustic impedance inversion is one of the most challenging tasks in geophysical exploration, facing difficulties such as insufficient well-logging data and non-linear relationships. Most inversion methods rely on strategies such as semi-supervised learning, and their inversion accuracy and stability still need further improvement. In this work, we propose a novel inversion framework that innovatively maps continuous seismic traces into high-dimensional linear features, transforming the entire inversion task into a linear extrapolation or interpolation problem to improve inversion stability. To achieve this goal, we designed two auxiliary networks to train the encoder. Meanwhile, the model adopts a heterogeneous structure to avoid shortcut learning, so as to extract more generalized and effective linear features. We tested our method on the most widely used datasets, and the experiments show that compared with some previous methods, the proposed method achieves higher inversion accuracy and stability. Finally, to ensure the reproducibility of the experiments, we will open-source the data and code.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic studies of Salt Precipitation: Influence of Brine Composition, Interfacial Tension, Flow Conditions, and Chemical Additives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the interfacial tension, fluid mobility, and crystallization behavior of various saline and additive-modified solutions in a microfluidic chip environment, simulating pore-scale processes during CO2 injection. The brine compositions included NaCl solutions at different concentrations, surfactant-modified fluids, alcohol-water mixtures, and ammonia solutions. Microfluidic experiments were performed on a range of flow rates and the dynamics of CO2 breakthrough, brine evaporation, and salt precipitation were analyzed.
  The results show that higher NaCl concentrations accelerate crystallization and increase the final fraction of the crystal, though they also introduce spatial variability and localized precipitation. Additives such as alkylbenzene sulfonate and propan-2-ol reduce interfacial tension, promote greater mobility, and suppress salt accumulation. Ammonia-based solutions demonstrate rapid ammonia bicarbonate crystallization immediately upon CO2 contact, leading to elevated water saturation and frequent chip clogging.
  Despite faster brine evaporation and earlier crystal nucleation at higher CO2 flow rates, no significant impact was observed on initial brine saturation or final crystal coverage. Crystal growth occurs within and outside brine pools, driven by capillary flow, with spatial distributions governed by stochastic breakthrough dynamics. The random nature of the residual brine geometry results in heterogeneous crystal patterns, which were found to be repeatable but not deterministic.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Microphysical Properties of Ice Crystals from Cloud Particle Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view. A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$, relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.</description>
