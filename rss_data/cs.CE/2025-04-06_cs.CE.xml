      <title>Adaptive Finite State Projection with Quantile-Based Pruning for Solving the Chemical Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an adaptive Finite State Projection (FSP) method for efficiently solving the Chemical Master Equation (CME) with rigorous error control. Our approach integrates time-stepping with dynamic state-space truncation, balancing accuracy and computational cost. Krylov subspace methods approximate the matrix exponential, while quantile-based pruning controls state-space growth by removing low-probability states. Theoretical error bounds ensure that the truncation error remains bounded by the pruned mass at each step, which is user-controlled, and does not propagate forward in time. Numerical experiments on biochemical systems, including the Lotka-Volterra and Michaelis-Menten and bi-stable toggle switch models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sizing and Material Choice for Additively Manufactured Compact Plate Heat Exchangers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advancements in additive manufacturing (AM) capabilities, new opportunities arise to design compact heat exchangers (cHEXs) that leverage AM's degrees of freedom (DOFs) to enhance energy and material efficiency. However, excessive size reduction in counterflow cHEXs can compromise effectiveness due to axial heat conduction through the solid material, influenced by thermal conductivity and wall thickness. This study investigates how AM material selection and thin-wall production limitations might constrain the core size of counterflow plate heat exchangers when targeting maximum power density. An optimization framework evaluates power densities for six materials: plastic, austenitic steel, Al2O3, AlN, aluminum, and copper. Evaluations are conducted under constant effectiveness and pressure drop while accounting for AM-specific plate thickness limits and a lower bound on plate spacing to address fouling. Across all scenarios, copper cHEXs exhibit the lowest power density, despite high thermal conductivity. Without constraints on plate thickness and spacing, the optimal plastic cHEX achieves a power density 1800x greater than the steel baseline, while copper decreases by a factor of 0.98. With equal plate thickness of 0.5 mm for all materials, plastic retains the highest power density, 12.2x more than copper. Introducing a fouling constraint of 0.8 mm plate spacing shifts the optimal material to austenitic steel. When material-specific plate thicknesses are considered, the plastic cHEX achieves the highest power density, five times greater than copper, due to superior thin-wall resolution. This study highlights the impact of AM constraints on the energy and material efficiency of cHEXs, and shows that low-conductivity materials like plastic or austenitic steel can outperform high-conductivity materials like copper in compact designs.</description>

      <title>A Unit-Cell Shape Optimization Approach for Maximizing Heat Transfer in Periodic Fin Arrays at Constant Solid Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic fin structures are often employed to enhance heat transfer in compact cooling solutions and heat exchangers. Adjoint-based optimization methods are able to further increase the heat transfer by optimizing the fin geometry. However, obtaining optimal geometries remains challenging in general because of the high computational cost of full array simulations. In this paper, a unit cell optimization approach is presented that starts from recently developed macro-scale models for isothermal solid structures. The models exploit the periodicity of the problem to reduce the computational cost of evaluating the array heat transfer to that of a single periodic unit cell. By combining these models with a geometrically-constrained free-shape optimization approach, optimal fin geometries are obtained for the periodic fin array that maintain a minimal fin distance. Moreover, using an augmented Lagrangian approach, also the average pressure gradient and barycenter of the fin can be fixed. On a fictitious use-case, heat transfer increases up to 104 \% are obtained. When also flow rate is constrained in addition to maintain a high effectiveness, only up to 8 \% heat transfer increase is observed. Finally, the errors of the unit-cell optimization approach are investigated, indicating that with a good choice of cost functional formulation, errors of the approach as low as 1-2 \% can be obtained for the periodically developed part of the array. Finally, the entrance effect to the heat transfer is found to be non-negligible with a contribution of 10-15 \% for the considered fin array. This advocates for further research to extend the unit-cell models towards improved modeling of entrance effects.</description>

      <title>A User-Tunable Machine Learning Framework for Step-Wise Synthesis Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce MHNpath, a machine learning-driven retrosynthetic tool designed for computer-aided synthesis planning. Leveraging modern Hopfield networks and novel comparative metrics, MHNpath efficiently prioritizes reaction templates, improving the scalability and accuracy of retrosynthetic predictions. The tool incorporates a tunable scoring system that allows users to prioritize pathways based on cost, reaction temperature, and toxicity, thereby facilitating the design of greener and cost-effective reaction routes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies involving complex molecules from ChemByDesign, showcasing its ability to predict novel synthetic and enzymatic pathways. Furthermore, we benchmark MHNpath against existing frameworks, replicating experimentally validated "gold-standard" pathways from PaRoutes. Our case studies reveal that the tool can generate shorter, cheaper, moderate-temperature routes employing green solvents, as exemplified by compounds such as dronabinol, arformoterol, and lupinine.</description>

      <title>Stock Price Prediction Using Triple Barrier Labeling and Raw OHLCV Data: Evidence from Korean Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that deep learning models trained on raw OHLCV (open-high-low-close-volume) data can achieve comparable performance to traditional machine learning (ML) models using technical indicators for stock price prediction in Korean markets. While previous studies have emphasized the importance of technical indicators and feature engineering, we show that a simple LSTM network trained on raw OHLCV data alone can match the performance of sophisticated ML models that incorporate technical indicators. Using a dataset of Korean stocks from 2006 to 2024, we optimize the triple barrier labeling parameters to achieve balanced label proportions with a 29-day window and 9\% barriers. Our experiments reveal that LSTM networks achieve similar performance to traditional machine learning models like XGBoost, despite using only raw OHLCV data without any technical indicators. Furthermore, we identify that the optimal window size varies with model hidden size, with a configuration of window size 100 and hidden size 8 yielding the best performance. Additionally, our results confirm that using full OHLCV data provides better predictive accuracy compared to using only close price or close price with volume. These findings challenge conventional approaches to feature engineering in financial forecasting and suggest that simpler approaches focusing on raw data and appropriate model selection may be more effective than complex feature engineering strategies.</description>

      <title>ORLM: A Customizable Framework in Training Large Models for Automated Optimization Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17743v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization modeling plays a critical role in the application of Operations Research (OR) tools to address real-world problems, yet they pose challenges and require extensive expertise from OR experts. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged to streamline and automate such task. However, current research predominantly relies on closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4, along with extensive prompt engineering techniques. This reliance stems from the scarcity of high-quality training datasets for optimization modeling, resulting in elevated costs, prolonged processing times, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, our work is the first to propose a viable path for training open-source LLMs that are capable of optimization modeling and developing solver codes, eventually leading to a superior ability for automating optimization modeling and solving. Particularly, we design the {\sc OR-Instruct}, a semi-automated data synthesis framework for optimization modeling that enables customizable enhancements for specific scenarios or model types. This work also introduces IndustryOR, the first industrial benchmark for evaluating LLMs in solving practical OR problems. We train several 7B-scale open-source LLMs using synthesized data (dubbed ORLMs{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/ORLM}), which exhibit significantly enhanced optimization modeling capabilities, achieving competitive performance across the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Additionally, our experiments highlight the potential of scaling law and reinforcement learning to further enhance the performance of ORLMs. The workflows and human-machine interaction paradigms of ORLMs in practical industrial applications are also discussed in the paper.</description>
