      <title>Unveiling MOA-2007-BLG-192: An M Dwarf Hosting a Likely Super-Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high angular resolution images of the microlensing target MOA-2007-BLG-192 using Keck adaptive optics and the Hubble Space Telescope. The planetary host star is robustly detected as it separates from the background source star in nearly all of the Keck and Hubble data. The amplitude and direction of the lens-source separation allows us to break a degeneracy related to the microlensing parallax and source radius crossing time. Thus, we are able to reduce the number of possible solutions by a factor of ${\sim}2$, demonstrating the power of high angular resolution follow-up imaging for events with sparse light curve coverage. Following Bennett et al. 2023, we apply constraints from the high resolution imaging on the light curve modeling to find host star and planet masses of $M_{\textrm{host}} = 0.28 \pm 0.04M_{\odot}$ and $m_p = 12.49^{+65.47}_{-8.03}M_{\oplus}$ at a distance from Earth of $D_L = 2.16 \pm 0.30\,$kpc. This work illustrates the necessity for the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) to use its own high resolution imaging to inform light curve modeling for microlensing planets that the mission discovers.</description>

      <title>More Realistic Planetesimal Masses Alter Kuiper Belt Formation Models and Add Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform simulations here that include the gravitational effects of the primordial planetesimal belt consisting of ~10^5 massive bodies. In our simulations, Neptune unlocks from resonance with the other giant planets and begins to migrate outward due to interactions with planetesimals before a planetary orbital instability is triggered, and afterward, residual Neptunian migration completes the formation of the modern Kuiper belt. Our present work exhibits a number of notable differences from prior work. First, Neptune's planetary resonance unlocking requires the Neptunian 3:2 mean motion resonance to sweep much of the primordial disk interior to 30 au prior to the giant planet instability. The pre-instability population of planetesimals is consequently lower in semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination, and this effect persists after the instability. Second, direct scattering between Pluto-mass bodies and other small bodies removes material from Neptunian resonances more efficiently than resonant dropout resulting from small changes in Neptune's semimajor axis during scattering between Pluto-mass bodies and Neptune. Thus, the primordial population of Pluto-mass bodies may be as few as ~200 objects. Finally, our simulation end states display a wide variety of orbital distributions, and clear relationships between final bulk Kuiper belt properties and Neptune's migration or initial planetesimal properties largely elude us. In particular, we find that the rapid, stochastic planetary orbital evolution occurring during the giant planet instability can significantly alter final Kuiper belt properties such as its inclination dispersion and the prominence of resonant populations. This complicates using modern Kuiper belt properties to confidently constrain early solar system events and conditions, including planetary orbital migration and the primordial Kuiper belt's characteristics.</description>

      <title>Phobos photometric properties from Mars Express HRSC observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to analyze Phobos' photometric properties using Mars Express mission observations to support the Martian Moons eXploration mission. We analyzed resolved images of Phobos acquired between 2004 and 2022 by the HRSC and the SRC cameras on board the Mars Express spacecraft. We performed photometric analysis using the Hapke model for both integrated and disk-resolved data. The Phobos phase function has a strong opposition effect due to shadow hiding, with an amplitude and a half-width of the opposition surge of 2.28$\pm$0.03 and 0.0573$\pm$0.0001, respectively. Overall, the surface of Phobos is dark, with a geometric albedo of 6.8 % in the green filter and backscattering. We also found a surface porosity of 87\%, indicating the presence of a thick dust mantle or of fractal aggregates on the top surface. The SSA maps revealed high reflectance variability, with the blue unit area in the northeast Stickney rim being up to 65\% brighter than average, while the Stickney floor is among the darkest regions, with reflectance 10 to 20% lower than average. Photometric modeling of the regions of interest selected in the red and blue units indicates that red unit terrains have a stronger opposition effect and a smaller SSA value than the blue ones, but they have similar porosity and backscattering properties. The HRSC data provide a unique investigation of the Phobos phase function and opposition surge, which is valuable information for the MMX observational planning. The Phobos opposition surge, surface porosity, phase integral, and spectral slope are very similar to the values observed for the comet 67P and for Jupiter family comets in general. Based on these similarities, we formulate a hypothesis that the Mars satellites might be the results of a binary or bilobated comet captured by Mars.</description>

      <title>BD-14 3065b (TOI-4987b): from giant planet to brown dwarf: evidence for deuterium burning in old age?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study reports the confirmation of BD-14 3065b, a transiting planet/brown dwarf in a triple-star system, with a mass near the deuterium burning boundary. BD-14 3065b has the largest radius observed within the sample of giant planets and brown dwarfs around post-main-sequence stars. Its orbital period is 4.3 days, and it transits a subgiant F-type star with a mass of $M_\star=1.41 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_\star=2.35 \pm 0.08 R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6935\pm90$ K, and a metallicity of $-0.34\pm0.05$ dex. By combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the TRES and Pucheros+ spectrographs, we measured a mass of $M_p=12.37\pm0.92 M_J$ and a radius of $R_p=1.926\pm0.094 R_J$. Our discussion of potential processes that could be responsible for the inflated radius led us to conclude that deuterium burning is a plausible explanation resulting from the heating of BD-14 3065b's interior. Detection of the secondary eclipse with TESS photometry enables a precise determination of the eccentricity $e_p=0.066\pm0.011$ and reveals BD-14 3065b has a brightness temperature of $3520 \pm 130$ K. With its unique characteristics, BD-14 3065b presents an excellent opportunity to study its atmosphere through thermal emission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Uranus and Neptune as methane planets: producing icy giants from refractory planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranus and Neptune are commonly considered ice giants, and it is often assumed that, in addition to a solar mix of hydrogen and helium, they contain roughly twice as much water as rock. This classical picture has led to successful models of their internal structure and has been understood to be compatible with the composition of the solar nebula during their formation (Reynolds and Summers 1965; Podolak and Cameron 1974; Podolak and Reynolds 1984; Podolak et al. 1995; Nettelmann et al. 2013). However, the dominance of water has been recently questioned (Teanby et al. 2020; Helled and Fortney 2020; Podolak et al. 2022). Planetesimals in the outer solar system are composed mainly of refractory materials, leading to an inconsistency between the icy composition of Uranus and Neptune and the ice-poor planetesimals they accreted during formation (Podolak et al. 2022). Here we elaborate on this problem, and propose a new potential solution. We show that chemical reactions between planetesimals dominated by organic-rich refractory materials and the hydrogen in gaseous atmospheres of protoplanets can form large amounts of methane 'ice'. Uranus and Neptune could thus be compatible with having accreted refractory-dominated planetesimals, while still remaining icy. Using random statistical computer models for a wide parameter space, we show that the resulting methane-rich internal composition could be a natural solution, giving a good match to the size, mass and moment of inertia of Uranus and Neptune, whereas rock-rich models appear to only work if a rocky interior is heavily mixed with hydrogen. Our model predicts a lower than solar hydrogen to helium ratio, which can be tested. We conclude that Uranus, Neptune and similar exoplanets could be methane-rich, and discuss why Jupiter and Saturn cannot.</description>

      <title>Do Temperate Rocky Planets Around M Dwarfs have an Atmosphere ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting an atmosphere on nearby temperate planets is one of the most important scientific objectives of the Webb mission, an endeavour in practice limited to a handful of well-characterized planets: Trappist-1d, e, f, g, LHS1140b, and the mini-Neptune K2- 18b. The first 18 months of atmospheric characterization with JWST have confirmed both its power and versatility to probe exoplanet atmospheres, and have highlighted the challenge of stellar activity in studying those atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy. Assessing the prevalence of atmosphere in temperate planets with a minimal degree of confidence will require a multi-cycle program of order of a few 1000 hours involving both eclipse photometry and transmission spectroscopy, a program that would have to be executed over a significant fraction of JWST's lifetime. The forthcoming 500 hours of Cycle 3 Director Discretionary Time dedicated to exoplanet programs represent a unique opportunity to initiate a deep reconnaissance of habitability of the best keystone temperate planets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point Masses. III. Detecting Haumea's Nonspherical Gravitational Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dwarf planet Haumea is one of the most compelling transneptunian objects (TNOs) to study, hosting two small, dynamically interacting satellites, a family of nearby spectrally unique objects, and a ring system. Haumea itself is extremely oblate due to its 3.9 hour rotation period. Understanding the orbits of Haumea's satellites, named Hi'iaka and Namaka, requires detailed modeling of both satellite-satellite gravitational interactions and satellite interactions with Haumea's nonspherical gravitational field (parameterized here as $J_2$). Understanding both of these effects allows for a detailed probe of the satellites' masses and Haumea's $J_2$ and spin pole. Measuring Haumea's $J_2$ provides information about Haumea's interior, possibly determining the extent of past differentation. In an effort to understand the Haumea system, we have performed detailed non-Keplerian orbit fitting of Haumea's satellites using a decade of new ultra-precise observations. Our fits detect Haumea's $J_2$ and spin pole at $\gtrsim2.5\sigma$ confidence. Degeneracies present in the dynamics prevent us from precisely measuring Haumea's $J_2$ with the current data, but future observations should enable a precise measurement. Our dynamically determined spin pole shows excellent agreement with past results, illustrating the strength of non-Keplerian orbit fitting. We also explore the spin-orbit dynamics of Haumea and its satellites, showing that axial precession of Hi'iaka may be detectable over decadal timescales. Finally, we present an ephemeris of the Haumea system over the coming decade, enabling high-quality observations of Haumea and its satellites for years to come.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point Masses. II. Non-Keplerian Shape Effects are Detectable in Several TNO Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 40 transneptunian binaries (TNBs) have fully determined orbits with about 10 others being solved except for breaking the mirror ambiguity. Despite decades of study almost all TNBs have only ever been analyzed with a model that assumes perfect Keplerian motion (e.g., two point masses). In reality, all TNB systems are non-Keplerian due to non-spherical shapes, possible presence of undetected system components, and/or solar perturbations. In this work, we focus on identifying candidates for detectable non-Keplerian motion based on sample of 45 well-characterized binaries. We use MultiMoon, a non-Keplerian Bayesian inference tool, to analyze published relative astrometry allowing for non-spherical shapes of each TNB system's primary. We first reproduce the results of previous Keplerian fitting efforts with MultiMoon, which serves as a comparison for the non-Keplerian fits and confirms that these fits are not biased by the assumption of a Keplerian orbit. We unambiguously detect non-Keplerian motion in 8 TNB systems across a range of primary radii, mutual orbit separations, and system masses. As a proof of concept for non-Keplerian fitting, we perform detailed fits for (66652) Borasisi-Pabu, possibly revealing a $J_2 \approx 0.44$, implying Borasisi (and/or Pabu) may be a contact binary or an unresolved compact binary. However, full confirmation of this result will require new observations. This work begins the next generation of TNB analyses that go beyond the point mass assumption to provide unique and valuable information on the physical properties of TNBs with implications for their formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point Masses. I. New Non-Keplerian Modeling Tools Applied to Trans-Neptunian Triple (47171) Lempo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many details of the formation and evolution of the solar system are best inferred by understanding the orbital and physical properties of small bodies in the solar system. For example, small body binaries are particularly valuable for measuring masses. By extending the models of small body binaries beyond point masses, new information about the shape and spin orientation becomes available. This is particularly informative for Trans-Neptunian multiples (two or more components) where shapes and spin orientations are poorly understood. Going beyond point masses requires modeling tools that no longer assume fixed Keplerian orbits. To this end, we have developed a new n-quadrupole integrator SPINNY (SPIN+N-bodY) and pair it with a Bayesian parameter inference tool MultiMoon, both of which are publicly available. We describe these tools and how they can be used to learn more about solar system small body multiple systems. We then apply them to the unique Trans-Neptunian hierarchical triple system (47171) Lempo, finding a three-point-mass solution for the first time. This solution has two surprises: unequal densities of the inner components and a dynamical configuration apparently unstable on the age of the solar system.</description>

      <title>Beyond Point Masses. IV. TNO Altjira is Likely a Hierarchical Triple Discovered Through Non-Keplerian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamically studying Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO) binaries allows us to measure masses and orbits. Most of the known objects appear to have only two components, except (47171) Lempo which is the single known hierarchical triple system with three similar-mass components. Though hundreds of TNOs have been imaged with high-resolution telescopes, no other hierarchical triples (or trinaries) have been found among solar system small bodies, even though they are predicted in planetesimal formation models such as gravitational collapse after the streaming instability. By going beyond the point-mass assumption and modeling TNO orbits as non-Keplerian, we open a new window into the shapes and spins of the components, including the possible presence of unresolved ``inner'' binaries. Here we present evidence for a new hierarchical triple, (148780) Altjira (2001 UQ$_{18}$), based on non-Keplerian dynamical modeling of the two observed components. We incorporate two recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, leading to a 17 year observational baseline. We present a new open-source Bayesian Point Spread Function (PSF) fitting code called nPSF that provides precise relative astrometry and uncertainties for single images. Our non-Keplerian analysis measures a statistically-significant ($\sim$2.5-$\sigma$) non-spherical shape for Altjira. The measured $J_2$ is best explained as an unresolved inner binary and an example hierarchical triple model gives the best fit to the observed astrometry. Using an updated non-Keplerian ephemeris (which is significantly different from the Keplerian predictions), we show that the predicted mutual event season for Altjira has already begun with several excellent opportunities for observations through $\sim$2030.</description>

      <title>The environment around young eruptive stars. SPHERE/IRDIS polarimetric imaging of 7 protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eruptive stars are a class of young stellar objects that show an abrupt increase in their luminosity. These burst-like episodes are thought to dominate the stellar accretion process during the class 0/class I stage. We present an overview of a survey of seven episodically accreting protostars aimed at studying their potentially complex circumstellar surroundings. The observations were performed with the instrument SPHERE, mounted at the VLT. We observed the eruptive stars in $H$-band with the near-infrared imager IRDIS and used the polarimeter to extract the polarized light scattered from the stars' surroundings. We produced polarized light images for three FUor objects, Z CMa, V960 Mon, and FU Ori, and four EXor objects, XZ Tau, UZ Tau, NY Ori, and EX Lup. We calculated the intrinsic polarization fraction for all the observed stars. In all systems we registered scattered light from around the primary star. FU Ori and V960 Mon are surrounded by complex structures including spiral-like features. In Z CMa, we detected a point source 0.7 arcsec to the northeast of the primary. Based on the astrometric measurements from archival Keck/NIRC2 data, we find this source to be a third member of the system. Further, Z CMa displays an outflow extending thousands of au. Unlike the other EXor objects in our sample, XZ Tau shows bright, extended scattered light structures, also associated with an outflow on a scale of hundreds of au. The other EXors show relatively faint disk-like structures in the immediate vicinity of the coronagraph. Asymmetric arms were only found around FUor objects, while faint disks seem to predominantly occur around EXors. Importantly, for Z CMa the detection of the faint extended structure questions previous interpretations of the system's dynamic state. The streamer which was associated with a fly-by object turned out to be part of a huge outflow extending 6000 au.</description>

Abstract: Observations of five Y dwarfs with three optical and near-infrared instruments at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias are reported. Deep images of the five targets and a low-resolution far-red optical spectrum for one of the targets were obtained. One of the Y dwarfs, WISE J173835+273258 (Y0), was clearly detected in the optical (z- and i-bands) and another, WISE J182831+265037 (Y2), was detected only in the z-band. We measured the colours of our targets and found that the z-J and i-z colours of the Y dwarfs are bluer than those of mid- and late-T dwarfs. This optical blueing has been predicted by models, but our data indicates that it is sharper and happens at temperatures about 150 K warmer than expected. Likely, the culprit is the K I resonance doublet, which weakens more abruptly in the T- to Y-type transition than expected. We show that the alkali resonance lines (Cs I and K I) are weaker in Y dwarfs than in T dwarfs; the far-red optical spectrum of WISE J173835+273258 is similar to that of late-T dwarfs, but with stronger methane and water features; and we noted the appearance of new absorption features that we propose could be due to hydrogen sulphide. The optical properties of Y dwarfs presented here pose new challenges to understanding grain sedimentation in extremely cool objects. The weakening of the very broad K I resonance doublet due to condensation in dust grains is more abrupt than theoretically anticipated. Consequently, the observed blueing of the z-J and i-z colours of Y dwarfs with respect to T dwarfs is more pronounced than predicted by models and could boost the potential of upcoming deep large-area optical surveys regarding their ability to detect extremely cool objects</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscope of irradiated disks: MUSE observations of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster. I. Sample presentation and ionization front sizes</title>

Abstract: In the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), protoplanetary disks exhibit ionized gas clouds in the form of a striking teardrop shape as massive stars irradiate the disk material. We present the first spatially and spectrally resolved observations of 12 proplyds, using Integral Field Spectroscopy observations performed with the MUSE instrument in Narrow Field Mode (NFM) on the VLT. We present the morphology of the proplyds in seven emission lines and measure the radius of the ionization front of the targets in four tracers, covering transitions of different ionization states for the same element. We also derive stellar masses for the targets. The measurements follow a consistent trend of increasing I-front radius for a decreasing strength of the far-UV radiation as expected from photoevaporation models. By analyzing the ratios of the I-front radii as measured in the emission lines of Ha, [OI] 6300, [OII] 7330, and [OIII] 5007, we observe the ionization stratification, that is, the most ionized part of the flow being the furthest from the disk (and closest to the UV source). The ratios of I-front radii scale in the same way for all proplyds in our sample regardless of the incident radiation. We show that the stratification can help constrain the densities near the I-front by using a 1D photoionization model.
  We derive the upper limits of photoevaporative mass-loss rates by assuming ionization equilibrium, and estimate values decreasing towards lower impinging radiation. We do not find a correlation between Mloss and stellar mass. The highest mass-loss rate is for the proplyd 244-440. These values of Mloss, combined with estimates of the disk mass with ALMA, confirm previous estimates of the short lifetime of these proplyds. This work demonstrates the potential of this dataset and offers a new set of observables to be used to test current and future models of external photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG LV. Multiple molecular species in the atmosphere of HAT-P-11 b and review of the HAT-P-11 planetary system</title>

Abstract: The atmospheric characterisation of hot and warm Neptune-size exoplanets is challenging due to their small radius and atmospheric scale height. The warm-Neptune HAT-P-11b is a remarkable target for such characterisation due to the large brightness of its host star (V=9.46 mag; H=7.13 mag). The aims of this work are to review the main physical and architectural properties of the HAT-P-11 planetary system, and to probe the presence of 8 molecular species in the atmosphere of HAT-P-11b at high spectral resolution in the near-infrared. The planetary system was reviewed by analysing transits and occultations of HAT-P-11b from the Kepler data set as well as HIRES at Keck archival radial-velocity (RV) data. We modelled the latter with Gaussian-process regression and a combined quasi-periodic and squared-exponential kernel to account for stellar variations on both (short-term) rotation and (long-term) activity-cycle timescales. In order to probe the atmospheric composition of HAT-P-11b, we observed 4 transits of this target with GIANO-B at TNG. We find that the long-period ($P\sim9.3$ years) RV signal previously attributed to planet HAT-P-11c is more likely due to the stellar magnetic activity cycle. Nonetheless, the Hipparcos-Gaia difference in the proper-motion anomaly suggests that an outer-bound companion might still exist. For HAT-P-11b, we measure a radius $R_{\rm p}=0.4466\pm0.0059\,R_{\rm J}$, a mass $M_{\rm p}=0.0787\pm0.0048\,M_{\rm J}$, and an eccentricity $e=0.2577^{+0.0033}_{-0.0025}$, in accordance with values in the literature. Probing its atmosphere, we detect $NH_3$ (S/N$=5.3$, significance$=5.0\sigma$) and confirm the presence of $H_2O$ (S/N$=5.1$, significance$=3.4\sigma$). We also tentatively detect the signal of $CO_2$ (S/N$=3.0$, significance$=3.2\sigma$) and $CH_4$ (S/N$=4.8$, significance$=2.6\sigma$), whose presence need to be confirmed by further observations.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter (H)eats Young Planets</title>

Abstract: We study the effect of dark matter annihilation on the formation of Jovian planets. We show that dark matter heat injections can slow or halt Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, preventing the accretion of hydrogen and helium onto the solid core. The existence of Jupiter in our solar system can therefore be used to infer constraints on dark matter with relatively strong interaction cross sections. In the case of spin-dependent dark matter, we derive novel constraints beyond the reach of current direct detection experiments. We highlight the possibility of a positive detection using future observations by JWST, which could reveal strongly varying planet morpholoiges close to our Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Tidal synchronization trapping in stars and planets with convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal torques can alter the spins of tidally interacting stars and planets, usually over shorter timescales than the tidal damping of orbital separations or eccentricities. Simple tidal models predict that in eccentric binary or planetary systems, rotation periods will evolve toward a "pseudosynchronous" ratio with the orbital period. However, this prediction does not account for "inertial" waves that are present in stars or gaseous planets with (i) convective envelopes, and (ii) even very slow rotation. We demonstrate that tidal driving of inertial oscillations in eccentric systems generically produces a network of stable "synchronization traps" at ratios of orbital to rotation period that are simple to predict, but can deviate significantly from pseudosynchronization. The mechanism underlying spin synchronization trapping is similar to tidal resonance locking, involving a balance between torques that is maintained automatically by the scaling of inertial mode frequencies with the rotation rate. In contrast with many resonance locking scenarios, however, the torque balance required for synchronization trapping need not drive mode amplitudes to nonlinearity. Synchronization traps may provide an explanation for low-mass stars and hot Jupiters with observed rotation rates that deviate from pseudosynchronous or synchronous expectations.</description>
