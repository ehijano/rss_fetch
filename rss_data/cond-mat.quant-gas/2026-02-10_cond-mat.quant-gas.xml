      <title>Non-Hermitian physics in the many-body system of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics exhibits unique physical properties beyond those of traditional Hermitian systems, such as symmetry breaking, the emergence of exceptional points, topological phase transitions, and more. These phenomena have been extensively studied across various platforms, including quantum optics, cold atom systems, superconducting circuits, and condensed matter physics. Rydberg atoms, with their long-range interactions and flexible controllability, provide a promising platform for the experimental realization of non-Hermitian physics. This review primarily summarizes the key experimental and theoretical achievements in the field of non-Hermitian physics within Rydberg atomic systems in recent years. It outlines the fundamental construction of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals the effective dissipation mechanisms induced by Rydberg atomic interactions, and discusses their impact on spectral properties and symmetry breaking. These studies not only deepen the understanding of quantum phase transitions in non-Hermitian many-body systems but also highlight the unique value of Rydberg atomic platforms in realizing and controlling topological states.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of the Three-Dimensional Anderson Transition with Ultracold Atoms in a Disordered Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization of particles -- the complete halt of wave transport through multiple scattering and phase coherence -- is a paradigmatic manifestation of quantum interference in disordered media. In three dimensions, the scaling theory predicts a quantum phase transition at a critical energy, the mobility edge, separating localized from diffusive states and underpinning metal-insulator transitions in electronic systems. Despite decades of experimental efforts, a direct observation of this emblematic transition for matter waves has remained elusive. Previous attempts with ultracold atoms were hindered by strong and uncontrolled energy broadening, resulting in indirect, sometimes inaccurate, and model-dependent estimates of the mobility edge. Here we implement a novel energy-resolved scheme to prepare atomic matter waves with a narrow energy distribution and track their expansion dynamics over long timescales. This allows for a direct observation of the three-dimensional Anderson transition in a laser-speckle disordered potential, and for a precise measurement of the mobility edge that is independent of any underlying theoretical modeling. Our measurements show excellent agreement with state-of-the-art numerical predictions over a wide range of disorder strengths, resolving long-standing discrepancies between prior experiments and theory. Beyond the three-dimensional Anderson transition, our approach opens new avenues for quantitative investigations of quantum critical phenomena in spatially disordered systems, including the roles of dimensionality, symmetry class, and interactions.</description>

      <title>Engineering a Bound State in the Continuum via Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical interaction potentials typically support either localized bound states below the dissociation threshold or delocalized scattering states above it. While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Our results establish quantum interference as a powerful mechanism for controlling openness in quantum matter and for engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Dynamically entangled oscillating state in a Bose gas with an attractive polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of an attractively interacting impurity suddenly immersed with a nonzero initial velocity into a system of one-dimensional weakly interacting homogeneous bosons. We uncover and characterize different dynamical regimes in the parameter space. Especially interesting is the relaxation of a fast impurity with a mass close to or exceeding the critical one, where the impurity exhibits undamped temporal long-lived velocity oscillations before reaching a stationary state. The underlying mechanism is the transient localization of a boson depletion cloud near the impurity, that oscillates around the boson density peak situated at the impurity position. The lifetime of this entangled oscillating state increases with the absolute value of the impurity-boson coupling. Cold atomic gases provide an ideal playground where this phenomenon can be probed.</description>

      <title>W-SLDA Toolkit: A simulation platform for ultracold Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the W-SLDA Toolkit, a general-purpose software package for simulating ultracold Fermi gases within the framework of density functional theory and its time-dependent extensions. The toolkit enables fully microscopic studies of interacting superfluid systems across the BCS-BEC crossover, including spin-imbalanced configurations and arbitrary external geometries. It provides both static and time-dependent solvers capable of describing a broad range of phenomena in one-, two-, and three-dimensional settings. In addition, the toolkit incorporates functionality for solving the standard Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for fermions, extending its applicability to other physical systems such as superconductors. The code is implemented in C with GPU acceleration and is optimized for hybrid CPU/GPU execution on modern high-performance computing platforms. It ensures scalability on leadership-class supercomputers, enabling fully three-dimensional simulations with large atomic numbers, and allows for direct benchmarks of ultracold-atom experimental setups. Its modular architecture facilitates straightforward extensions, user customization, and seamless interoperability with other scientific software frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive collection of practical usage examples is provided through the integrated reproducibility packs functionality, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of computational results.</description>

      <title>The continuous spectrum of bound states in expulsive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the contrary to the common intuition that a steep expulsive potential makes quantum states widely delocalized, we demonstrate that one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Schr\"{o}dinger equations, which include expulsive potentials that are \emph{steeper than the quadratic} (anti-harmonic-oscillator) ones, give rise to \emph{normalizable} (effectively localized) eigenstates. These states constitute full continuous spectra in the 1D and 2D cases alike. In 1D, these are spatially even and odd eigenstates. The 2D states may carry any value of the vorticity (alias magnetic quantum number). Asymptotic approximations for wave functions of the 1D and 2D eigenstates, valid far from the center, are derived analytically, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerically found counterparts. Special exact solutions for vortex states are obtained in the 2D case. These findings suggest an extension of the concept of bound states in the continuum, in quantum mechanics and paraxial photonics. Gross-Pitaevskii equations are considered as the nonlinear extension of the 1D and 2D settings. In 1D, the cubic nonlinearity slightly deforms the eigenstates, maintaining their stability. On the other hand, the quintic self-focusing term, which occurs in the photonic version of the 1D model, initiates the dynamical collapse of states whose norm exceeds a critical value.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity in a dressed qubit with local dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a dressed qubit implemented by a spinless fermion hopping between two lattice sites with each site strongly coupled to a bath of phonons. We employ Lang-Firsov transformation to make the problem tractable perturbatively. Applying time-convolutionless master equation within the polaron frame, we investigate decoherence dynamics of the dressed qubit within the singlet-triplet basis of the system for a wide range of bath spectral densities. It is shown that the coherence persists for longer time scales for large coupling values and shows non-monotonic behaviour reflecting the presence of non-Markovianity in the dynamics. Non-Markovianity, characterized by coherence revivals and non-monotonic decay patterns, emerges distinctly depending on the bath spectrum and coupling strengths. Systems coupled to sub-Ohmic baths, whether both or in combination with another type, display pronounced memory effects at relatively small values of couplings. In contrast, combinations involving Ohmic and super-Ohmic baths exhibit noticeable non-Markovianity only at higher couplings.</description>

      <title>Variational Method for Interacting Surfaces with Higher-Form Global Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational method for interacting surface systems with higher-form global symmetries. As a natural extension of the conventional second-quantized Hamiltonian of interacting bosons, we explicitly construct a second-quantized Hamiltonian formulated in terms of a closed surface operator $\hat{\phi}[C_p^{}]$ charged under a $p$-form global symmetry. Applying the variational principle, we derive a functional Schr\"{o}dinger equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in conventional bosonic systems. In the absence of external forces, the variational equation admits a uniform solution that is uniquely determined by a microscopic interaction potential $U(\psi^*\psi)$ and the chemical potential. This uniform solution describes a uniform gas of bosonic surfaces. Using the obtained energy functional, we show that low-energy fluctuations contain a gapless $p$-form field $A_p^{}$ when the $p$-form global symmetry is $\mathrm{U}(1)$, whereas the $p$-form field becomes massive for discrete symmetries, whose low-energy limit is described by a $\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory. As a consequence, the system exhibits abelian topological order with anyonic surface excitations. In the presence of external forces, however, solving the functional equation in full generality remains challenging. We argue, however, that the problem reduces to solving the conventional Gross-Pitaevskii equation when external forces act separately on the center-of-mass and relative motions. In addition, we present analytic solutions for topological defects as analogs of vortex and domain-wall solutions in conventional bosonic systems. Finally, as a concrete microscopic model, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ lattice gauge theory and apply our variational method to this system.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Renormalization Group from a Few-Body Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity plays a fundamental role in open quantum systems and describes a wide variety of effects of interactions with environments, including quantum measurement. However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus. Our result bridges different contexts of non-Hermitian systems in high-energy and atomic, molecular, and optical physics, opening an interdisciplinary playground of non-Hermitian few-body physics.</description>

      <title>Super-Tonks-Girardeau Quench in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10910v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a quench from a one-dimensional gas with strong and repulsive local interactions to a strongly attractive one, known as the super-Tonks-Girardeau effect. By incorporating both an optical lattice and non-local interactions (specifically nearest-neighbor), we discover a previously unexplored phenomenon: the disruption of the state during the quench, but within a specific range of interactions. Our study employs the extended Bose-Hubbard model across various system sizes, starting with analytical results for two atoms and progressing to few-body systems using exact diagonalization, DMRG and TDVP methods. Finally, we use a numerical implementation of the local density approximation for a macroscopic number of atoms. Consistently, our findings unveil a region where the initially self-bound structure expands due to the super-Tonks-Girardeau quench. The fast evaporation provides a tool to characterize the phase diagram in state-of-art experiments exploring the physics of the extended Bose-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Resolving the problem of complex sound velocity in binary Bose mixtures with attractive intercomponent interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2015 Dmitry Petrov theoretically suggested that, in a binary mixture of bosons a quantum liquid droplet may arise due to the competition between attractive intercomponent and repulsive intracomponent forces. Although this prediction has been confirmed experimentally, the model by itself suffers from a serious conceptual problem: The low - lying excitation spectrum manifests a purely imaginary phonon velocity, $c_d^2 &lt; 0$. In the present work, we develop a self consistent theory of two-component Bose systems with attractive interspecies interactions, which accurately takes into account pair correlations in terms of anomalous and mixed densities. We have shown that this procedure is able to resolve the problem of $c_d^2 &lt; 0$. Limiting ourselves with a symmetric Bose mixture at zero temperature, we have found a region of stability in which a droplet can survive.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle from Operator Asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the incompatibility norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful, versatile toolkit for its application.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Thermal Reservoirs with Tunable Temperature in a Trapped-Ion Spin-Boson Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</description>
