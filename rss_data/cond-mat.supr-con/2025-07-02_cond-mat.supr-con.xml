      <title>Superconductivity via paramagnon and magnon exchange in a 2D near-ferromagnetic full metal and ferromagnetic half-metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconductivity in paramagnetic and ferromagnetically-ordered phases in a two-dimensional electron system with parabolic fermionic dispersion and short-range repulsive interaction. In the paramagnetic phase, we find that a weak momentum dependence of a paramagnon propagator parametrically reduces the onset temperature for the pairing compared to that in phenomenological theories which assume a strong dispersion of a paramagnon and also changes the topology of the gap function. In the ferromagnetic phase, we show that the order instantly polarizes low-energy fermionic excitations. We derive the fully renormalized pairing interaction between low-energy fermions, mediated by two transverse Goldstone modes and show that it is attractive in a spatially-odd channel. The pairing temperature in the ferromagnetic phase is found to be a fraction of the Fermi energy, significantly larger than in the paramagnetic phase near the transition. Our results are relevant for understanding superconductivity in proximity to itinerant ferromagnetism in multi-valley graphene systems, particularly the ones with full valley and spin polarization.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity induced by spin-orbit coupling in a two-valley ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the origin of superconductivity in a ferromagnetically ordered state of multi-layer graphene systems placed in proximity to WSe$_2$. We model these materials by a two-valley system of interacting fermions with small pockets and Ising spin-orbit coupling. The model yields a canted ferromagnetic order, which gives rise to a half-metal. We obtain the magnon spectrum and derive two sets of magnon-mediated 4-fermion interactions: spin-flip interactions mediated by a single magnon and spin-preserving interactions mediated by two magnons. We argue that both processes have to be included on equal footing into the magnon-mediated pairing interaction between low-energy fermions from the filled bands. Then the full magnon-mediated interaction satisfies Adler criterion and for a valley-odd/spatially-even order parameter contains a universal attractive piece. This term is induced by spin-orbit coupling and is confined to energies which are parametrically smaller than the Fermi energy. We argue that, due to retardation, this magnon-mediated attraction gives rise to superconductivity despite that there exists a stronger static repulsion, in close analogy with how phonon-mediated attraction gives rise to pairing in the presence of stronger Coulomb (Hubbard) repulsion.</description>

      <title>Dissipation engineering of fermionic long-range order beyond Lindblad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of engineering dissipatively long-range order that is robust against heating in strongly interacting fermionic systems, relevant for atoms in cavity QED. It was previously shown [Tindall et al. Phys.Rev.Lett. 123, 030603 (2019)] that it is possible to stabilize long-range order in a Hubbard model by exploiting a dissipative mechanism in the Lindblad limit, this latter being valid for spectrally unstructured baths. Here, we first show that this mechanism still holds when including additional spin-exchange interactions in the model, that is for the tUJ model. Moreover, by means of a Redfield approach that goes beyond the Lindblad case, we show how the stability of the engineered state depends crucially on properties of the bath spectral density and discuss the feasibility of those properties in an experiment.</description>

      <title>Microscopic evidence for Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and multiband effects in KFe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state is a superconducting phase characterized by broken translational-symmetry, where Cooper pairs form with non-zero momentum between Zeeman-split Fermi surfaces. This state is highly sensitive to band structure and pairing symmetry. In multiband superconductors, the FFLO state can significantly deviate from its standard form, but experimental verification has remained challenging. Here, we present $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on the multiband superconductor KFe$_2$As$_2$. In the low-temperature, high-magnetic-field region above the upper critical field $B_{c2}$, we observe a clear increase in the second moment of the NMR spectrum, along with a strong enhancement in the spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature 1/$T_1$$T$. These results indicate an emergence of superconducting spin smecticity and Andreev bound states from the spatially modulation of the superconducting gap, providing microscopic evidence for the FFLO state. The obtained phase diagram reveals a distinct boundary line between the FFLO and homogenous superconducting (HSC) states with a low critical temperature of the FFLO state $T^\ast \approx 0.2 T_c$, which can be attributed to the multiband effects in KFe$_2$As$_2$. Our results show that the iron-based superconductors are a good material platform for studying the FFLO state and highlight the importance of the multiband effects on this exotic phase.</description>

      <title>Homotopy continuation method for solving Dyson equation fully self-consistently: theory and application to NdNiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solution of the Dyson equation for the small-gap systems can be plagued by large non-converging iterations. In addition to the convergence issues, due to a high non-linearity, the Dyson equation may have multiple solutions. We apply the homotopy continuation approach to control the behavior of iterations. We used the homotopy continuation to locate multiple fully self-consistent GW solutions for NdNiO2 solid and to establish the corresponding Hartree-Fock limits. Some of the solutions found are qualitatively new and help to understand the nature of electron correlation in this material. We show that there are multiple low-energy charge-transfer solutions leading to a formation of charge-density waves. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental conductivity measurements. To rationalize the structure of solutions, we compare the k-point occupations and generalize the concept of natural difference orbitals for correlated periodic solids.</description>

      <title>Versatile multi-q antiferromagnetic charge order in correlated vdW metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the discovery of graphene, interest in van der Waals (vdW) materials has surged; yet, advancing "beyond graphene" physics requires the development of quantum material platforms that host versatile many-body states. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 300 mK, we uncover two competing states in vdW metal CeTe3: charge-ordered in-plane antiferromagnetic phases forming stripe and checkerboard patterns. Remarkably, the competition between them is tuned through a modest in-plane magnetic field (approximately 1.5 T), revealing significant cooperative phenomena between frustrated antiferromagnetism, charge order, and competing Fermi surface nesting. Underlying strongly intertwined many-body states are consistently signaled by density of states deformations exceeding plus/minus 30 meV scale across the Fermi level. Our findings provide a promising correlated vdW platform hosting versatile two-dimensional many-body physics, offering a fertile ground to explore topologically nontrivial multi-q charge-ordered antiferromagnetism, quantum criticality, unconventional superconductivity, and their potential interconnections.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Pairing Instability of Ultrafast Electron Beams with Space Charge Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron beams are essential for many applications, yet space-charge interactions in high-intensity beams lead to energy dissipation, coherence loss, and pulse broadening. Existing techniques mitigate these effects by using low-flux beams, preserving beam coherence into the quantum regime. Here, we propose a novel approach by treating the electrons as a strongly correlated Fermi gas rather than merely as an ensemble of charged point-like particles. We introduce a photon-induced pairing mechanism that generates a net attractive force between two electrons, thereby forming "flying bound states" analogous to Cooper pairs of conduction electrons in superconductors. Employing the setting of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), we demonstrate that the effective interaction via single-photon exchange among PINEM electrons can suppress the inherent repulsive Coulomb interaction, enabling a pairing instability mediated by structured electromagnetic fields at near-resonant velocity matching regimes. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of the free-electron pairs in a bunched beam, underscoring the potential to facilitate a phase-coherent condensate of electrons, which can further enhance beam coherence and multi-particle correlation for high-intensity electrons.</description>

      <title>Local Limit Disorder Characteristics of Superconducting Radio Frequency Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays Nb-based superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities represent fundamental tools used for (Standard Model) particle acceleration, (beyond Standard Model) particle probing, and long-lifetime photon preservation. We study the SRF frequency shift in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the quality factor mainly at low temperatures within the Dynes superconductor model. We scrutinize and use the local limit response to the external electromagnetic field. Our approach allows for a finer analysis of the peculiar behavior of the resonant frequency shift immensely close to $T_c$, observed in recent experiments. In several regimes, we analytically elaborate on the width and depth of the resulting dip. Studying the sign of the slope of the resonant frequency shift at $T_c$ in the moderately clean regime clarifies the role of the pair-breaking and pair-conserving disorder. Next, to find the relevance of our description, we compare and also fit our results with the recent experimental data from the N-doped Nb sample presented in [arXiv:2307.07905]. Our analysis complies with the experimental findings, especially concerning the dip width. We offer a straightforward, homogeneous-disorder-based interpretation within the moderately clean regime. Comparative analysis for three other cavities with different resonant frequencies reported in [arXiv:2207.14236] points towards a similar regime. Assuming the same regime at low temperatures, we address details of the high-quality plateaus. Summing all up, this work presents (and studies the limits of) the simple, effective description of the complex problem corresponding to the electromagnetic response in the superconductors, combining homogeneous conventional pairing and two different kinds of disorder scattering.</description>

      <title>Pairing boost from enhanced spin-fermion coupling in the pseudogap regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a fluctuation analysis of the pairing interaction in the hole-doped Hubbard model within the dynamical cluster approximation. Our analysis reveals that spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing differs qualitatively in the over- and underdoped regimes. In the underdoped regime, spin fluctuations open a pseudogap. We show that in this regime the spin-fermion coupling mediates a giant attraction between antinodal fermions. This explains why superconductivity survives at underdoping in the Hubbard model and cuprates, despite the lack of coherent fermionic quasiparticles in the pseudogap regime.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Weyl Superconductors with Different Pairings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</description>
