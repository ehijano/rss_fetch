      <title>Incoherent Particle Production in Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first complete treatment of incoherent photon-initiated production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions, focussing on the dilepton and diphoton final states. In the former case we compare to the ATLAS measurement of dielectron production and find that our predictions match the data very well. In the latter case we show that this contribution is too small to explain the observed broad in diphoton acoplanarity background to the purely coherent light-by-light scattering signal. We in addition consider a new `quark emission' topology, which while naively might be expected to dominate the incoherent diphoton production channel, is in fact found to be kinematically suppressed. Finally, we revisit QCD-initiated diphoton production and issue of theoretical uncertainties in this case. We find that this again cannot explain the observed size of the higher acoplanarity background. The production mechanism leading to this background to light-by-light production, and the reason for its observed enhancement in comparison to the dilepton case, therefore remains unclear.</description>

      <title>SEAL - A Symmetry EncourAging Loss for High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical symmetries provide a strong inductive bias for constructing functions to analyze data. In particular, this bias may improve robustness, data efficiency, and interpretability of machine learning models. However, building machine learning models that explicitly respect symmetries can be difficult due to the dedicated components required. Moreover, real-world experiments may not exactly respect fundamental symmetries at the level of finite granularities and energy thresholds. In this work, we explore an alternative approach to create symmetry-aware machine learning models. We introduce soft constraints that allow the model to decide the importance of added symmetries during the learning process instead of enforcing exact symmetries. We investigate two complementary approaches, one that penalizes the model based on specific transformations of the inputs and one inspired by group theory and infinitesimal transformations of the inputs. Using top quark jet tagging and Lorentz equivariance as examples, we observe that the addition of the soft constraints leads to more robust performance while requiring negligible changes to current state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Dark neutron stars from a heavy dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation and properties of dark neutron stars in a scenario where dark matter is made up of (heavy) dark baryons in a sequestered copy of the MSSM. This scenario naturally explains the coincidence of baryonic and dark matter abundances without the need for tuning particle masses. In particular, the supersymmetry breaking scales in the visible and dark sectors may differ by up to 10-11 orders of magnitude. We argue that dark neutrons should be the lightest dark baryons, but that dark protons may be cosmologically long lived. This allows a small fraction of dark matter to remain ionized until the first halos start to form, providing cooling mechanisms that foster the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of sub-halo structures, ultimately resulting in dark neutron star and black hole formation. For a wide range of model parameters, we find dark neutron stars with generally smaller mass and radius than ordinary visible sector neutron stars. We also discuss their potential detectability, particularly through gravitational microlensing and dark magnetic dipole radiation at radio frequencies through photon-dark photon kinetic mixing.</description>

      <title>Single-spin measurements and heavy new physics in the $e^+e^- \to t\bar{t}$ process at an FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of single-spin components of the spin-density matrix in the $e^+ e^- \to t\bar{t}$ process at a future FCC-ee for probing heavy new physics parametrized using the SMEFT framework. We consider the full spectrum of spin observables and the complete angular decomposition of the $t\bar{t}$ production process in our study. We find that single-spin measurements generically provide stronger probes of SMEFT Wilson coefficients than measurements where the $t\bar{t}$ spins are correlated, and that single-spin observables are important for resolving flat directions that can appear in the Wilson-coefficient parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an introduction to renormalisation, focusing first on a pedagogical description of fundamental concepts of the procedure and its features, then we introduce the renormalisation group and its equations. We discuss then the case of gauge theories such as QCD summarising the current state of the art. We introduce the renormalisation scale setting problem in QCD and we give an illustration of the possible optimisation procedures currently in use.</description>

      <title>Underground Production of Electromagnetic Dark States by MeV-scale Electron Beams and Detection with CCDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore the possibility of new light fermionic particles with millicharge or electromagnetic form factor interactions and their underground production via an electron beam in the 100 MeV range and their subsequent detection using a CCD-sensor. We evaluate the S-matrix elements and the phase spaces for production analytically, and then calculate the corresponding cross sections numerically. For millicharged fermions this set-up could be able to probe a window in parameter space, yet unconstrained by direct detection experiments. The electric or magnetic dipole moment of a light fermion could feasibly be probed with enough beam time or an increased beam energy.</description>

      <title>Statistical Indications of Toponium Formation in Top Quark Pair Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of six differential cross-section measurements of top-quark pair production in the dilepton channel from the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The data are compared to state-of-the-art QCD predictions with and without the inclusion of toponium formation effects. This contribution is modelled via a re-weighting of fixed-order matrix elements using the Green's function of the non-relativistic QCD Hamiltonian, and we employ a statistical model to quantify the preference of the data for the toponium hypothesis. All observables yield Bayes factors larger than unity, with two exceeding 20, yielding strong evidence for toponium formation in top-quark pair production at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Ultra-relativistic freeze-out: a bridge from WIMPs to FIMPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the case for dark matter (DM) produced by ultra-relativistic freeze-out (UFO). UFO is the mechanism by which Standard Model (SM) neutrinos decouple from the radiation bath in the early universe at a temperature $T_{d} \approx 1$ MeV. This corresponds to chemical freeze-out without Boltzmann suppression, such that the freeze-out (decoupling) temperature $T_{d}$ is much greater than $m_{\nu}$ and the neutrinos are therefore ultra-relativistic at freeze-out. While UFO has historically been rejected as a viable mechanism for DM production due to its association with hot DM and the accompanying incompatibility with $\Lambda$CDM, we show that when the approximation of instantaneous reheating after inflation is lifted, UFO can produce cold DM and account for the entire observed relic density in large regions of parameter space. In fact, DM with masses ranging from sub-eV to PeV scales can undergo UFO and be cold before structure formation, given only a simple perturbative, post-inflationary reheating period prior to radiation domination. For some interactions, such as a contact interaction between the Higgs and DM scalars, there is a seamless transition between the WIMP and FIMP regimes which excludes UFO. However, for many other interactions, such as SM fermions producing fermionic DM via a heavy scalar or vector mediator, the WIMP to FIMP transition occurs \textit{necessarily} via a large intermediate region corresponding to UFO. We characterize the general features of UFO in this paper, while we supply a more detailed analysis in a companion paper. We find that UFO during reheating can produce the correct relic density ($\Omega_{\chi}h^2 = 0.12$) for DM masses spanning about 13 orders of magnitude, reheating temperatures spanning 17 orders of magnitude, and beyond the Standard Model (BSM) effective interaction scales spanning 11 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Baryon-number-violating nucleon decays in SMEFT extended with a light scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New light particles have received considerable attention in recent years. Baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decays involving such light particles are able to provide stringent constraints. They exhibit distinctive experimental signatures that merit thorough investigation. We systematically investigate BNV nucleon decay with a light scalar in an effective field theory framework. Within this framework, we set stringent bounds on BNV operators using available experimental data and predict the occurrence of several BNV three-body nucleon decays. We further study contributions to dinucleon to dilepton transitions in a nucleus mediated by the scalar, which complements single nucleon decay. Finally, we provide three ultraviolet-complete models that can generate different subsets of BNV operators in leading order. Our theoretical framework will facilitate experimental searches for those exotic nucleon decays.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Freeze-in from a $Z^\prime$ Reheaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Standard Model (SM) extended by a secluded $U(1)_D$ gauge sector encompassing a Dirac fermion ($\chi$) dark matter (DM), an abelian gauge boson $Z^\prime$ and a SM-singlet complex-scalar field $\Phi$, whose radial component drives cosmic inflation. When the Higgs portal coupling is small, the $Z^\prime$ then acts as a {\it ``reheaton''}, dominating the energy budget of the Universe before finally yielding the SM bath, with reheating temperature $&lt; O(10)$ TeV, through the gauge portal interaction. We explore the possibility that DM freezes-in via non-thermal $Z^\prime$ decays before reheating ends, giving rise to substantial viable parameter space. We account for non-perturbative effects, relevant during the initial stages of reheating, using lattice simulations. We additionally show how the cosmological gravitational wave (GW) background produced by preheating and inflation allow for a direct probe of the reheating mechanism.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of $cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$ and $ss\bar{c}\bar{c}$ Tetraquarks within the Framework of Regge Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the mass spectra of all-charm ($cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$) and doubly strange- doubly charm ($ss\bar{c}\bar{c}$) tetraquark states using the framework of Regge phenomenology. Employing a quasi-linear Regge trajectory ansatz, we derive linear and quadratic mass inequalities for hadrons, which provide constraints on the masses of tetraquark states. We estimate the range of ground state masses of $cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$ tetraquarks and determine the Regge slope parameters by fitting the corresponding $(J, M^2)$ trajectories. These parameters are then utilized to predict the mass spectra of orbital excited states of both $cc\bar{c}\bar{c}$ and $ss\bar{c}\bar{c}$ systems in the $(J, M^2)$ plane. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to radial excitations by exploring Regge trajectories in the $(n, M^2)$ plane. The obtained mass predictions are compared with existing theoretical results from various models. Additionally, we discuss the possible identification of the experimentally observed $\psi(4660)$ and $\chi_{c0}(4700)$ resonances as tetraquark candidates. The results presented in this study offer useful benchmarks for future experimental investigations and may assist in the spin-parity assignment of exotic hadronic states. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of multiquark dynamics and the spectroscopy of exotic hadrons within the framework of Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark photons from dark-scalar decays at CEPC and FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of proposed CEPC and FCC-ee with a center-of-mass energy of 240 GeV to long-lived dark photons heavier than 2 GeV that are pair-produced via the prompt decays of a light scalar mixed with the Standard-Model Higgs boson. We compute the production and decay rates of both the light scalar and the dark photon, and develop two search strategies targeting displaced vertices within the inner tracker of the main detectors. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the signal acceptance and projected sensitivity for each strategy. Our results show that, for the scalar-Higgs mixing angle set at $10^{-2}$ just below the current upper limit, the proposed searches at CEPC and FCC-ee can probe dark-photon kinetic-mixing parameter several orders of magnitude below existing bounds, for dark photons lighter than half the dark-scalar mass.</description>

Abstract: The electromagnetic memory is a theoretically predicted effect of great conceptual importance. In this Letter, we show that gravitation acceleration can serve as a source to print memory phases in superconducting states, through the electric field and vector potential it induces inside a conductor. This physical picture offers a novel perspective on the control of quantum phases and the test of gravitational effects in conductors.</description>

      <title>NLO heavy-quark contributions to DIS structure functions in the ACOT scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02407v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations of heavy-quark contributions to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions $F_4$ and $F_5$ within the Aivazis--Collins--Olness--Tung (ACOT) scheme, implemented in the open source library \texttt{APFEL++} using \texttt{CT18NLO} parton distribution functions. These structure functions, suppressed by lepton mass effects in light-lepton processes, become significant in muon, tau-lepton and neutrino scattering at facilities such as SHiP, IceCube, and DUNE. Our results reveal NLO corrections up to 10\% relative to leading order, with pronounced heavy-quark effects at low Bjorken-$x$, impacting gluon and strange quark distributions. In the unpolarized case, $F_{4/5}^{\gamma Z}$ and $F_{4/5}^{\gamma}$ do not contribute to the cross section, while the $\gamma Z$ interference becomes accessible with longitudinally polarized lepton beams at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), offering enhanced sensitivity at low $Q^2$ due to reduced $Z$-boson propagator suppression. Analytical NLO expressions have also been derived for the polarized structure functions $g_1$, $g_4$, $g_5$, $g_6$, and $g_7$ in the ACOT framework. These developments enable precise theoretical predictions for upcoming experimental programs and global QCD analyses.</description>

      <title>Probing an extra Higgs boson at future linear $e^+ e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of probing an extra Higgs boson at future linear $e^+ e^-$ colliders. We consider the production process $e^+e^- \to H\nu \bar\nu$, followed by the decay $H \to W^+W^-$, where $H$ is the extra $\textit{CP}$-even Higgs boson of the general two Higgs doublet model (G2HDM). This process is governed by the $\textit{CP}$-even Higgs mixing angle, $\cos\gamma$, offering direct access to this parameter. We discuss constraints on $\cos\gamma$ using existing LHC data and test the viability of the G2HDM top-quark-driven scenario for electroweak baryogenesis. We perform a full Monte Carlo simulation of the signal and background, and show that an extra Higgs boson in the mass range $200 \leq m_H \leq 400$ GeV could be probed at high energy linear $e^+ e^-$ colliders. Promising results are found for CLIC running at 1.5 and 3 TeV collision energies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the discovery reach and exclusion limits for an ultraheavy diquark scalar (7 - 8.75 TeV) decaying into two vectorlike quarks (1.5 - 2 TeV) at the HL-LHC, improving upon the statistical results reported in our previous six-jet final state study. The statistical analysis was performed using the output of Machine Learning algorithms trained to discriminate signal from background. The mass regions of interest were determined through scans of the local $p$-values, $CL_s$, and the upper limits on the model-independent signal strength $\mu$. The results indicate a promising sensitivity to ultraheavy diquark scalars within the explored mass range, suggesting that the HL-LHC could either discover or set stringent exclusion limits on such particles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of two state-of-the-art tools for the simulation of Higgs boson pair production via vector boson fusion (VBF) as implemented in the Monte-Carlo tools GoSam+Whizard and the POWHEG-BOX. Cross sections and distributions are provided within the Standard Model and beyond, within scenarios typical for experimental physics analyses, and for a range of energies of relevance to the LHC and its upcoming high luminosity phase. We further perform a detailed study of the so-called VBF approximation, in particular in the presence of anomalous Higgs boson couplings.</description>

      <title>Masses of Light Flavor Mesons using Bethe-Salpeter Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work employs the approach based on the Bethe-Salpeter and Dyson-Schwinger equations to study the light meson spectrum. The Dyson-Schwinger equation of the quark propagator is truncated using the Maris-Tandy model for the dressed gluon propagator, which incorporates both the infrared enhancement and the perturbatively correct ultraviolet behavior. Additionally, for the dressed quark-gluon vertex, we apply its bare form and the Ball-Chiu model, which minimally satisfies the constraint imposed by the gauge symmetry through its Ward-Green-Takahashi identity. Consistent truncation of both Bethe-Salpeter and Dyson-Schwinger equations requires that axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity, arising from chiral symmetry of the Lagrangian of quantum chromodynamics, must not be violated. We utilize this identity as an additional constraint to truncate the Bethe-Salpeter equation and examine the impact of two choices of quark-gluon vertex, along with the application of the Maris-Tandy model on the light meson spectrum. To extract the masses of flavored and unflavored light mesons, we solve the inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation using the Pad$\acute{e}$ approximation, which enables us to locate the poles of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude without requiring a numerical solution in the timelike region of momentum space. We find that truncations of the Bethe-Salpeter equation based on bare and Ball-Chiu vertices, coupled with the Maris-Tandy model, yield consistent results.</description>

      <title>Searches for heavy neutrinos at 3 TeV CLIC in fat jet final states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type-I seesaw mechanism provides an elegant explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses via the introduction of heavy Majorana neutrinos (N), which also constitute a well-motivated extension of the Standard Model. In this work, we explore the production and detection prospects of TeV-scale heavy neutrinos ($m_N \gtrsim 1$ TeV) at a future 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). We focus on two distinct decay topologies: (i) $N \to \ell^\pm W^\mp$ with hadronic $W$ boson decay, leading to a final state with one charged lepton, a hadronic fat-jet $J_W$, and missing transverse energy ($1\ell + J_W + \slashed{E}_T$); and (ii) $N \to \nu h$ with subsequent Higgs decay $h \to b\bar{b}$, yielding a Higgs-tagged fat-jet $J_h$ and $\slashed{E}_T$. Based on comprehensive detector-level simulations and background analysis, we present both $2\sigma$ exclusion limits and $5\sigma$ discovery reaches in the $m_N$-$|V_{\ell N}|^2$ plane. We further extract 95\% confidence level upper limits on the mixing parameter $|V_{\ell N}|^2$, and perform a detailed comparison with existing constraints from direct searches at future colliders and indirect global fits. Our findings demonstrate that a 3 TeV CLIC can improve the sensitivity to $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ by about two orders of magnitude compared to the projected reaches of future hadron colliders, while remaining competitive with other CLIC search channels.</description>

      <title>Progress on Constraining the Strange Quark Contribution to the Nucleon Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a global fit of neutral-current elastic (NCE) neutrino-scattering data and parity-violating electron-scattering (PVES) data with the goal of determining the strange quark contribution to the vector and axial form factors of the proton. Knowledge of the strangeness contribution to the axial form factor, $G_A^s(Q^2)$, at low $Q^2$ will reveal the strange quark contribution to the nucleon spin, as $G_A^s(Q^2=0)=\Delta s$. Previous fits [1,2] of this form included data from a variety of PVES experiments (PVA4, HAPPEx, G0, SAMPLE) and the NCE neutrino and anti-neutrino data from BNL E734. These fits did not constrain $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ very well because there was no NCE data for $Q^2&lt;0.45$ GeV$^2$. Our new fit includes for the first time MiniBooNE NCE data from both neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering; this experiment used a hydrocarbon target and so a model of the neutrino interaction with the carbon nucleus was required. Three different nuclear models have been employed; a relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model, the SuperScaling Approximation (SuSA) model, and a spectral function (SF) model [3]. We find a tremendous improvement in the constraint of $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ compared to previous work, although more data is needed from NCE measurements that focus on exclusive single-proton final states, for example from MicroBooNE [4].

      <title>Model Parameter Reconstruction of Electroweak Phase Transition with TianQin and LISA: Insights from the Dimension-Six Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of TianQin and LISA to reconstruct the model parameters in the Lagrangian of new physics scenarios that can generate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition. Taking the dimension-six Higgs operator extension of the Standard Model as a representative scenario for a broad class of new physics models, we establish the mapping between the model parameter $\Lambda$ and the observable spectral features of the stochastic gravitational wave background. We begin by generating simulated data incorporating Time Delay Interferometry channel noise, astrophysical foregrounds, and signals from the dimensional-six model. The data are then compressed and optimized, followed by geometric parameter inference using both Fisher matrix analysis and Bayesian nested sampling with PolyChord, which efficiently handles high-dimensional, multimodal posterior distributions. Finally, machine learning techniques are employed to achieve precise reconstruction of the model parameter $\Lambda$. For benchmark points producing strong signals, parameter reconstruction with both TianQin and LISA yields relative uncertainties of approximately $20$--$30\%$ in the signal amplitude and sub-percent precision in the model parameter $\Lambda$. TianQin's sensitivity is limited to stronger signals within its optimal frequency band, whereas LISA can reconstruct parameters across a broader range of signal strengths. Our results demonstrate that reconstruction precision depends on signal strength, astrophysical foregrounds, and instrumental noise characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical implications of an electron Yukawa modification are considered in the context of a possible Higgs pole run at FCC-ee, aimed at bounding this coupling. We start from an effective field theory viewpoint, considering the impact of renormalisation group effects on related observables and also examining assumptions on the broader UV flavour structure. We then give an overview of the landscape of simplified models, investigating phenomenological constraints arising at higher orders. A short discussion of fine-tuning is also included.</description>

      <title>Infrared divergences and the photon mass in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infrared properties of QED are investigated within the framework of the Dyson-Schwinger equations. Our study finds that, independently of the value of the coupling constant, requiring the photon self-energy to be finite for any momenta, combined with a smooth behavior for the photon-fermion vertex, is equivalent to state that the photon is massless and that the photon propagator diverges at low momenta as $1/k^2$. Furthermore, the Schwinger mechanism to generate, in a gauge invariant way, a photon mass is investigated and the form factors that can be at the origin of a possible photon mass are identified. For the Schwinger mechanism the link between the finiteness of the photon self-energy and the masslessness of the photon is lost. The infrared behavior of the fermion gap equation and the vertex equation are found to be infrared safe integral equations. Moreover, by studying chiral fermions within QED it is observed that the requirement of the finiteness of the photon self-energy translates into a fermion propagator that behaves as $\slashed{p}/p^4$.</description>

      <title>Impact of the $a_1(1260) \pi$ cascade contribution on $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Standard Model description of the recently measured rare decays $D^0\to\pi^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$. Because of the effectiveness of the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism in charm flavour-changing neutral currents, those decays are driven by non-local insertions of four-quark operators. Following previous work, we consider the mediation of resonances both for the dipion and dilepton pairs. For the first time, we incorporate the effect of the cascade-type topology $D^0\to \pi^- a_1^+(1260)(\to\pi^+\rho^0(\to\ell^+\ell^-))$, which manifests distinctly in the invariant-mass and angular distributions. We find that this partial amplitude comprises one of the largest contributions to the decay rate and obtain an unprecedented agreement of the Standard Model prediction with the available LHCb data. Finally, we compare to the available CLEO-c, LHCb, and BESIII amplitude analyses for the analogous four-body hadronic decays and find that similar values of the hadronic parameters of our model successfully describe the two classes of decays.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tunnelling Across Hydrogen Bonds: Proton--Deuteron Isotope Effects from a Cornell-Type Potential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in chemistry, biology, and condensed-matter physics, where quantum tunnelling can strongly influence structure and dynamics. Isotope substitution (H $\rightarrow$ D) provides a sensitive probe of such tunnelling, but theoretical descriptions often rely on purely numerical models or simplified potentials that obscure physical interpretation. Here we employ a Cornell-type potential combined with a double-well Schr\"odinger approach to investigate proton and deuteron tunnelling across hydrogen bonds. The model yields semi-analytical wavefunctions and tunnelling splittings that transparently capture isotope-dependent quantum effects. We present scaling behaviour of tunnelling splittings with isotope mass, discuss the influence of barrier width and curvature, and compare model trends with representative experimental and computational results. Beyond hydrogen bonding, the framework provides a general methodology for modelling tunnelling in double-well systems relevant to spectroscopy, enzymatic catalysis, and materials applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Proton Tunneling Splittings with a Wavefunction-Based Double-Well Model: Application to the Formic Acid Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling. Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx 2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about $0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models, while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative to full multidimensional quantum treatments.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories: chiral anomaly in the finite temperature massless Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry has emerged in recent years as a practical quantity to study phases of matter. We present the first study of entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories by considering the chiral anomaly of the analytically solvable massless Schwinger model at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>A short blanket for cosmology: the CMB lensing anomaly behind the preference for a negative neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) challenge particle physics constraints on the total neutrino mass, pointing to values smaller than the lower limit from neutrino oscillation experiments. To examine the impact of different CMB likelihoods from $\mathit{Planck}$, lensing potential measurements from $\mathit{Planck}$ and ACT, and BAO data from DESI, we introduce an effective neutrino mass parameter ($\sum \tilde{m}_{\nu}$) which is allowed to take negative values. We investigate its correlation with two extra parameters capturing the impact of gravitational lensing on the CMB: one controlling the smoothing of the peaks of the temperature and polarization power spectra; one rescaling the lensing potential amplitude. In this configuration, we infer $\sum \tilde{m}_{\nu}=-0.018^{+0.085}_{-0.089}~\text{eV}~(68\% ~\text{C.L.})$, which is fully consistent with the minimal value required by neutrino oscillation experiments. We attribute the apparent preference for negative neutrino masses to an excess of gravitational lensing detected by late-time cosmological probes compared to that inferred from $\mathit{Planck}$ CMB angular power spectra. We discuss implications in light of the DESI BAO measurements and the CMB lensing anomaly.</description>

      <title>The curious case of parabolic encounters: gravitational waves with linear &amp; non-linear memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The memory effect is known to introduce a permanent displacement in the gravitational wave (GW) detectors after the passage of a GW signal. While the linear memory adheres to the source properties, the non-linear memory is a secondary effect sourced by the GW itself. In the present work, we discuss GW signals with both these kinds of memory effects, while focusing on the parabolic limit of an encounter. This special case is theoretically intriguing and emerges as a limiting situation for both eccentric and hyperbolic events. However, in this paper, we argue that a simple extrapolation of memory calculations for eccentric or hyperbolic cases to the parabolic case may lead to incorrect estimations. Therefore, we treat the parabola as a special case and use an intrinsic parameterization, with which we calculate gravitational wave signals and their energy spectrum via an effective field theory formalism. Unlike the hyperbolic case, which is known to have linear memory, we notice that parabolic encounters bring out new features in the zero frequency limit (ZFL). Our work highlights some of the key challenges and salient aspects of these encounters, and paves the way to study such binary evolution with nonzero memory.</description>

      <title>Gradient RG Flow in Scalar-Fermion QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradient property of the renormalisation group (RG) is examined to four-loop order in scalar-fermion systems in $d=4$ and $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The crucial role played by the beta shift, which is a modification of the standard dim-reg beta function, is elucidated, and specific conditions that it needs to satisfy for the RG flow to be gradient are derived. Over a thousand gradient-flow conditions are found, all of which are scheme-independent and satisfied whenever the full set of results needed to check them is available. It is shown, in the framework of the $\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion, that the space of conformal field theories (CFTs) is dominated by those with non-zero beta shift as the number of fields grows.

      <title>Bulk-boundary decomposition of neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on this decomposition.</description>

      <title>Charged-Current Elastic Scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the measurement of the charged-current elastic scattering process $e^-p\rightarrow\nu_e n$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This process provides sensitivity to the poorly constrained axial form factor of the nucleon, which encodes the spatial distribution of weak charge. Collisions of electrons with polarized protons enable measuring the axial form factor via the $e^{-\!}\,\vec{p} \to \nu_e\,n$ target-spin asymmetry for the first time. We conclude that a measurement of charged-current elastic scattering at the EIC will prove very challenging.</description>

      <title>Testing Quantum Gravity with Gravitational Waves from the ringdown of binary Black Holes coalescences: A New Frontier in Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves emitted during the merging phase of compact binary coalescing objects has opened a new field of investigation in fundamental physics. It is now possible to test the predictions of General Relativity with unprecedented precision in the strong gravitational field regime. These initial observations therefore call for further research, as the detection of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing black holes may allow the investigation of the properties of spacetime near the event horizon, also providing valuable information on the structure of these objects. This also opens the possibility of testing predictions from quantum gravity models regarding the presumed quantized structure of black holes, related to the quantization of their surface and, consequently, their entropy. In the future, the considerable amount of data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration will be followed by observations from next-generation interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer. It is therefore of great interest to explore the potential of gravitational wave observations for investigating aspects of quantum gravity, which we will address considering the special case of the ringdown emission following the coalescence of binary black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>

      <title>Roper Resonance Structure and Exploration of Emergent Hadron Mass from CLAS Electroproduction Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $N(1440)1/2^+$ nucleon resonance, first identified in 1964 by L.D. Roper and collaborators in analyses of $\pi N$ hadroproduction data have continued to provide pivotal insights that serve to advance our understanding of nucleon excited states. In this contribution, we present results from studies of the structure of the Roper resonance based on exclusive $\pi N$ and $\pi^+\pi^-p$ electroproduction data measured with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab. These analyses have revealed the Roper resonance as a complex interplay between an inner core of three dressed quarks and an external meson--baryon cloud. Analyses of the CLAS results on the evolution of the Roper resonance electroexcitation amplitudes with photon virtuality $Q^2$, within the framework of the Continuum Schwinger Method, have conclusively demonstrated the capability to gain insight into the strong interaction dynamics responsible for generating more than 98\% of hadron mass. Further extension of such studies to higher $Q^2$--through experiments currently underway with the CLAS12 detector and in the future with a potential CEBAF energy upgrade to 22 GeV--offers the only foreseeable opportunity to explore the full range of distances where the dominant portion of hadron mass and resonance structure emerges.</description>

      <title>Fundamental structure of string geometry theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of a non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this theory, the ``classical'' action is almost uniquely determined by T-symmetry, which is a generalization of the T-duality, where the parameter of ``quantum'' corrections $\beta$ in the path-integral of the theory is independent of that of quantum corrections $\hbar$ in the perturbative string theories. We distinguish the effects of $\beta$ and $\hbar$ by putting " " like "classical" and "loops" for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $\beta$, respectively, whereas by putting nothing like classical and loops for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $\hbar$, respectively. A non-renormalization theorem states that there is no ``loop'' correction. Thus, there is no problem of non-renormalizability, although the theory is defined by the path-integral over the fields including a metric on string geometry. No ``loop'' correction is also the reason why the complete path-integrals of the all-order perturbative strings in general string backgrounds are derived from the ``tree''-level two-point correlation functions in the perturbative vacua, although string geometry includes information of genera of the world-sheets of the stings. Furthermore, a non-perturbative correction in string coupling with the order $e^{-1/g_s^2}$ is given by a transition amplitude representing a tunneling process between the semi-stable vacua in the ``classical'' potential by an ``instanton'' in the theory. From this effect, a generic initial state will reach the minimum of the potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a new high precision calculation of the isospin vector charge $g_{S,T}$ of the nucleon using recently proposed ``blending" method which provides a high-accuracy stochastic estimate of the all-to-all fermion propagator. By combining the current-involved interpolation operator, which can efficiently cancel the major excited state contamination, we can extract high-precision $g_S$ and $g_T$ directly at the physical pion mass. Using 15 of the $N_f=2+1$ lattice ensembles which covers 5 lattice spacing, 5 combinations with the same quark masses and lattice spacing but multiple volumes, and includes three at the physical pion mass, we report so far most accurate lattice QCD prediction $g_T^{\rm QCD} = 1.0258[79]_{\rm tot}(56)_{\rm stat} (24)_{a} (44)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi (24)_{\rm ex} (05)_{\rm re}$ and $g_S^{\rm QCD} = 1.107[47]_{\rm tot}(32)_{\rm stat} ( 04)_{a} (29)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi (18)_{\rm ex} (08)_{\rm re}$ at $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ 2~GeV, with the systematic uncertainty from continuum, infinite volume, chiral extrapolations, excited state contamination and also renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the hypothesis of $K(1460)$ being a hadronic $J^P=0^-$ molecule through nonperturbative $S$-wave $K K\bar K$, $K\pi\pi$, $K\pi\eta$ coupled-channel dynamics in a three-body unitary isobar approach. The scalar two-body coupled-channel resonances $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$, $a_0(980)$ and $K^*_0(700)$ are generated in the subsytems in amplitudes that match phase shifts from experiment. In a first step, previous results in the limit of mass-degenerate, stable $f_0$ and $a_0$ isobars are reproduced. Once the full seven-coupled channel model is switched on, other $S$-matrix effects obscure and modify the resonance signal, including complex thresholds, a two-body cusp, and a triangle singularity at threshold.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations (three using the NJL model and the other using the MFTQCD model), and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality on all sets. One set of hybrid NJL equations of state was also constrained by adding the GW170817 detection. All sets can describe observational data and theoretical restrictions. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at lower densities compared to the NJL models. The MFTQCD model indicates that NSs with 1.4 solar mass have quark matter in their inner core. However, NJL models suggest that it is more probable that 1.4 solar mass NSs do not contain quark matter. Both the MFTQCD and NJL models agree that there is quark matter in 2 solar mass NSs. It is discussed that hybrid stars with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius of more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, with respect to the canonical NS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fixed points and phase diagrams of semi-simple supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to chiral superfields and a superpotential. Particular emphasis is put on new phenomena which arise due to the semi-simple nature of gauge interactions and the constraints dictated by supersymmetry, unitarity, and the $a$-theorem. Using field multiplicities as free parameters, we find all superconformal fixed points and classify theories according to their phase diagrams. Highlights include asymptotically free theories displaying a range of interacting fixed points in the IR, asymptotically non-free theories that become asymptotically safe due to residual interactions, UV-complete theories with gauge sectors that are simultaneously UV-free and IR-free, and theories that remain interacting both in the asymptotic UV and IR. Estimates for the sizes of conformal windows are also provided, and implications for model building are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Relations between Fermion Masses and Isospin Couplings in the Microscopic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04680v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quark and lepton masses and mixings are considered in the framework of the microscopic model. The most general ansatz for the interactions among tetrons leads to a Hamiltonian $H_T$ involving Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), Heisenberg and torsional isospin forces. Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian provides for 24 eigenvalues which are identified as the quark and lepton masses. While the masses of the third and second family arise from DM and Heisenberg type of isospin interactions, light family masses are related to torsional interactions among tetrons. Neutrino masses turn out to be special in that they are given in terms of tiny isospin non-conserving DM, Heisenberg and torsional couplings. The approach not only leads to masses, but also allows to calculate the quark and lepton eigenstates, an issue, which is important for the determination of the CKM and PMNS mixing matrices. Compact expressions for the eigenfunctions of $H_T$ are given. The almost exact isospin conservation of the system dictates the form of the lepton states and makes them independent of all the couplings in $H_T$. Much in contrast, there is a strong dependence of the quark states on the coupling strengths, and a promising hierarchy between the quark families shows up.</description>

      <title>Improving the solver for the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation with Automatic Differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) evolution equation is an equation derived from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics that allows one to evolve with collision energy the scattering amplitude of a pair of quark and antiquark off a hadron target, called the dipole amplitude. The initial condition, being a non-perturbative object, usually has to be modeled separately. Typically, the model contains several tunable parameters that are determined by fitting to experimental data. In this contribution, we propose an implementation of the BK solver using differentiable programming. Automatic differentiation offers the possibility that the first and second derivatives of the amplitude with respect to the initial condition parameters are automatically calculated at all stages of the simulation. This fact should considerably facilitate and speed up the fitting step. Moreover, in the context of Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMD), we demonstrate that automatic differentiation can be used to obtain the first and second derivatives of the amplitude with respect to the quark-antiquark separation. These derivatives can be used to relate various TMD functions to the dipole amplitude. Our C++ code for the solver, which is available in a public repository, includes the Balitsky one-loop running coupling prescription and the kinematic constraint. This version of the BK equation is widely used in the small-$x$ evolution framework.</description>

      <title>Modular invariant inflation and reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use modular symmetry as an organizing principle that attempts to simultaneously address the lepton flavor puzzle, inflation, and post-inflationary reheating. We demonstrate this approach using the finite modular group $A_4$ in the lepton sector. In our model, neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the form of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular field also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The corresponding prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small, $r \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, while the prediction for the running of the spectral index, $\alpha \sim -\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, could be tested in the near future. An appealing feature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for reheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms. Although the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck scale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The same couplings responsible for reheating can also contribute to generating baryon asymmetry of the Universe through non-thermal leptogenesis. However, the contribution is negligibly small in the current inflationary setup.</description>

Abstract: We present a computation of the one-loop QCD corrections to top-quark pair production in association with a $W$ boson, including terms up to order $\varepsilon^2$ in dimensional regularization. Providing a first glimpse into the complexity of the corresponding two-loop amplitude, this result is a first step towards a description of this process at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. We perform a tensor decomposition and express the corresponding form factors in terms of a basis of independent special functions with compact rational coefficients, providing a structured framework for future developments. In addition, we derive an explicit analytic representation of the form factors, valid up to order $\varepsilon^0$, expressed in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. For the complete set of special functions required, we obtain a semi-numerical solution based on generalized power series expansion.</description>

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is an optical Cherenkov detector instrumenting one cubic kilometer of ice at the South Pole. The Cherenkov photons emitted following a neutrino interaction are detected by digital optical modules deployed along vertical strings within the ice. The densely instrumented bottom central region of the IceCube detector, known as DeepCore, is optimized to detect GeV-scale atmospheric neutrinos. As upward-going atmospheric neutrinos pass through Earth, matter effects alter their oscillation probabilities due to coherent forward scattering with ambient electrons. These matter effects depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the density distribution of electrons they encounter during their propagation. Using simulated data at the IceCube Deepcore equivalent to its 9.3 years of observation, we demonstrate that atmospheric neutrinos can be used to probe the broad features of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. In this contribution, we present the preliminary sensitivities for establishing the Earth matter effects, validating the non-homogeneous distribution of Earth's electron density, and measuring the mass of Earth. Further, we also show the DeepCore sensitivity to perform the correlated density measurement of different layers incorporating constraints on Earth's mass and moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quasi-Dirac neutrinos in diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the sources of astrophysical neutrinos are still unknown, they are believed to be produced by a population of sources in the distant universe. Measurements of the diffuse, all-sky astrophysical flux can thus be sensitive to flavor and energy-dependent propagation effects, such as very long baseline oscillations. These oscillations are present in certain neutrino mass models, such as when neutrinos are quasi-Dirac. Assuming generic models for the source flux, we find that these oscillations can still be resolved even when integrated over wide distributions in source redshift. We use two sets of IceCube all-sky flux measurements, made with muon and all-flavor neutrino samples, to set constraints at the $3\sigma$ level on quasi-Dirac mass-splittings between $(5 \times 10^{-19}, 8 \times 10^{-19})~\textrm{eV}^2$. We also consider systematic uncertainties on the source population and find that our results are robust under alternate spectral hypotheses or physical redshift distributions. Our analysis shows that spectral features in the all-sky neutrino measurements provide strong constraints on massive neutrino scenarios and are sensitive to uncharted parameter space.</description>

      <title>Investigation of triply heavy spin-3/2 baryons in their ground and excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the masses and residues of triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2, including $\Omega^*_{ccc}$, $\Omega^*_{ccb}$, $\Omega^*_{bbc}$ and $\Omega^*_{bbb}$, using the QCD sum rules method. Our calculations primarily focus on obtaining the masses of the first three resonances, that is, the ground state (1S), the first orbital excited state (1P), and the first radial excited state (2S), for the mentioned baryons. We additionally determine the residues of these baryons, which serve as key parameters for studying their possible decay channels and interactions with other particles. To achieve higher accuracy compared to previous studies, we consider nonperturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We present our calculated outcomes in two distinct energy schemes, referred to as pole and $\mathrm{\overline{MS}}$. Given the absence of experimental data for these states, we compare our results with previous theoretical calculations that are reported in relevant studies employing various approaches. These results may provide valuable insights for experimental groups searching for the triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Quest for a phenomenologically consistent low cutoff theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Randall-Sundrum model with the Higgs localized on the IR brane solves the gauge hierarchy problem. However, the associated low cutoff ($\Lambda \sim 10$ TeV) generically leads to unacceptably rapid nucleon decay and excessively large Majorana neutrino masses. Achieving consistency while simultaneously explaining the Yukawa hierarchy requires either a horizontal symmetry or a discrete gauged symmetry. We demonstrate that eliminating all dangerous operators within a horizontal symmetry framework must come with large and unattractive charge assignments, if possible at all. Hence, we consider an exact discrete gauged $\mathbf{Z}_N$ symmetry, with fermion mass hierarchies generated via wave function overlap. We employ this to reproduce the current Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa and Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata structures. Assuming universal five-dimensional Yukawa couplings, generation-blind profile for right-handed neutrinos and flat profile for the third generation SM doublets, it predicts Dirac neutrinos with a total mass $\sim 66$ meV. Since the $\mathbf{Z}_N$ charges must be generation blind, flavor observables serve as key probes.</description>

      <title>Parametric Coincidence in the Baryon to Dark Matter Ratio from Affleck-Dine Baryogenesis and UV Freeze-in Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We highlight that the observed concurrence between the baryon and dark matter relic densities can be explained via a parametric coincidence between two distinct production mechanisms: Affleck-Dine baryogenesis and dark matter UV freeze-in. In the Affleck-Dine mechanism, the baryon asymmetry is naturally proportional to the inflationary reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh}$, which also plays a critical role in setting the relic abundance of UV freeze-in dark matter. Since Affleck-Dine baryogenesis requires flat directions in the potential, the framework is inherently supersymmetric, offering compelling UV freeze-in dark matter candidates such as the gravitino. We outline scenarios in which $T_{\rm rh}$ simultaneously determines both relic abundances, resulting in a baryon-to-dark matter ratio of order unity that is largely insensitive to $T_{\rm rh}$. We also discuss the conditions required to avoid Q-ball formation or dark matter production by other mechanisms, such as NLSP decays, to preserve the parametric coincidence between baryon and dark matter abundances.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Parameters of Inclusive $\Lambda_b$ Decays from Small Velocity Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonperturbative parameters entering the heavy quark expansion for the inclusive decay rates of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon, focusing on the kinetic term $\hat{\mu}_\pi^2$ and the Darwin term $\hat{\rho}_D^3$. Recent evaluations have yielded an unexpectedly large Wilson coefficient associated with the dimension-six Darwin operator, which motivates a more detailed examination of the associated hadronic matrix element. We constrain $\hat{\mu}_\pi^2$ and $\hat{\rho}_D^3$ using Small Velocity Sum Rules for the inclusive semileptonic decay $\Lambda_b \to X_c e^- \bar{\nu}_e$. These sum rules relate moments of hadronic structure functions, computed via the Operator Product Expansion, to hadronic matrix elements of relevant exclusive transitions. Truncating the hadronic side to include the lowest-lying charmed baryon states with spin-parity $ J^P = 1/2^+, 1/2^-, 3/2^- $, we employ the corresponding lattice QCD form factors near zero recoil as inputs. By analysing zeroth and higher moments, we derive inequalities that define an allowed region in the $(\hat{\mu}_\pi^2, \hat{\rho}_D^3)$ plane. The derived constraints are consistent, within uncertainties, with estimates from spectroscopic relations and the nonrelativistic constituent quark model. This work refines the determination of key HQE parameters for $\Lambda_b$, with implications for precision predictions of heavy baryon lifetimes and inclusive decays of heavy baryons in general.</description>

      <title>Searching for gluon saturation effects in the momentum transfer dependence of coherent charmonium electroproduction off nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study for the first time the transverse momentum transfer distributions $d\sigma/dt$ in coherent production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions within the QCD color dipole approach based on a rigorous Green function formalism. This allows us to treat properly the color transparency effects, as well as the higher and leading-twist shadowing corrections associated with the $|Q\bar Q\rangle$ and $|Q\bar QnG\rangle$ Fock components of the photon. While the multi-gluon photon fluctuations represent the dominant source of nuclear shadowing at kinematic regions related to the recent LHC and its future upgrade to LHeC, the upcoming electron-ion collider at RHIC will additionally require the proper incorporation of reduced quark shadowing. The latter effect leads to a significant decrease in the differential cross sections $d\sigma/dt$ compared to standard calculations based on the eikonal form for the dipole-nucleus amplitude. The leading-twist shadowing corrections, corresponding to a non-linear QCD evolution of a partial dipole-nucleus amplitude, reduce substantially charmonium $t$-distributions in the LHeC energy range. We predict a non-monotonic energy dependence of $d\sigma/dt$ suggesting so possible gluon saturation effects with increased onset at larger $t$-values. In addition to shadowing corrections, we study how the color transparency effects affect the shape of $t$-dependent nuclear modification factor. We also briefly discuss several aspects that can modify the charmonium production rate and thus may have a large impact on the search for gluon saturation effects.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Hot SM, Magnetic Flux &amp; Baryogenesis from Helicity Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the electroweak crossover of the Standard Model (SM) in the early Universe, focusing on the interplay between generalized global symmetries, magnetic flux dynamics, and baryogenesis. Employing the dimensionally reduced 3d effective field theory of the SM at high temperature, we identify the symmetry structure -- including higher-form and magnetic symmetries -- and analyze their spontaneous breaking patterns across the crossover. We further define a gauge-invariant mixing angle that interpolates between $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{em}$ magnetic fields. Based on this framework, we examine baryogenesis via decaying magnetic helicity and identify three key effects: the baryon asymmetry is modified by an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor due to (1) the gauge-invariant definition of the mixing angle and (2) the approximate conservation of the unconfined magnetic flux; (3) a novel non-perturbative process in the presence of magnetic flux, which has been overlooked in previous analyses. Our findings suggest that the previous estimation of baryon asymmetry from the magnetic helicity decay may have sizable uncertainties, and we caution against relying on it, calling for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Effect of Cosmic Neutrino Background on the Dark Matter Self-interaction via Neutrino force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino-pair exchange induces a neutrino force that can drive dark matter (DM) self-interactions and impact small-scale structure formation. In the presence of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), this force can be modified, with important consequences for DM phenomenology. We study the effect of the C$\nu$B on neutrino forces, generated by the scalar and pseudoscalar interactions. We explore the significance of the background neutrino force on the scalar DM-neutrino portal model, including DM self-scattering and annihilation. Our results show that the interplay between attractive vacuum potential and repulsive background potential leads to a screening effect that varies across DM mass ($m_\chi$) regimes, strongly affecting DM self-scattering in the DM mass $m_\nu \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim T_{C \nu B}$. Meanwhile, for DM annihilation, the screening completely vanishes the Sommerfeld Enhancement induced by the neutrino force. Overall, the C$\nu$B substantially reshapes the viable coupling range for DM self-interactions while remaining compatible with current constraints, offering a pathway to small-scale structure problems.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Baryogenesis with BARYONET: a self-contained review of the WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive, self-contained pedagogical computation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG), from the derivation of the semiclassical, CP-dependent force to the formulation and solution of the transport equations obtained from the Boltzmann equations$-$all implemented in the open-source code BARYONET. Our analysis follows the semiclassical WKB approach, where spatially varying complex masses across expanding bubble walls feel CP-violating forces that bias plasma transport. Starting from the stationary Boltzmann equation in the wall frame and projecting onto a hierarchy of velocity moments, we derive a compact, fluid-like system of coupled differential equations for chemical potentials and velocity perturbations. After obtaining the solutions, one can define the left-handed baryon chemical potential, which acts as the source term for the weak sphalerons. These processes generate the baryon asymmetry in front of the wall, which is subsequently frozen once it passes through it.
  We validate the framework against established formalisms and provide benchmarks in representative scenarios, including singlet extensions of the Standard Model, two-Higgs-doublet models, and Higgs$-\phi^6$ constructions. The resulting BARYONET implementation delivers an automated, reproducible pipeline for WKB-based baryogenesis studies, connecting formal derivations with phenomenological applications.
  In parallel, we revisit standard EWBG ingredients$-$diffusion constants, Yukawa/helicity-flip rates, and strong/weak sphaleron rates$-$to clarify conventions, update numerical inputs, and present a pedagogical derivation, ensuring transparent reproducibility.</description>

Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>

      <title>U-spin symmetry energy and hyperon puzzle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining the (u,d) I-spin doublets or (d,s) U-spin doublets, the SU(3) flavor symmetry of light quarks can be decomposed into SU(2)$_I\times$U(1)$_Y$ or SU(2)$_U\times$U(1)$_Q$ subgroups, which have been widely adopted to categorize hadrons and their decay properties. The I-spin counterpart for the interactions among nucleons has been extensively investigated, i.e., the nuclear symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, which characterizes the variation of binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio in a nuclear system. In this work, we propose U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ for hyperonic matter to characterize the variation of the binding energy with the inclusion of hyperons. In particular, being the lightest hyperon, $\Lambda$ hyperons are included in dense matter, where the U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is fixed according to state-of-the-art constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysical observations using Bayesian inference approach. It is found that $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is much smaller than that of $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, indicating much stronger proton-neutron attraction than that of nucleon-hyperon pairs. Consequently, $\Lambda$ hyperon potential increases significantly and becomes repulsive at large density, where there is more than 80\% probability that $\Lambda$ hyperons do not emerge in neutron stars. For those undergoing emergence within neutron stars, the onset density of $\Lambda$ hyperons $n_\mathrm{b}^\Lambda$ is typically larger than $\sim$0.8 fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to neutron stars more massive than 1.7 $M_\odot$.</description>

An analysis with RSD data indicates smaller amplitude of perturbation. Including RSD data results in a slightly weaker upper limit on the neutrino mass than that derived for data without RSD, which is common in other extended models too. We have evaluated the impacts of RSD observations on some extended models, including the varying electron mass model, a time-dependent dark energy model with two parameter equations of state (EOS), and a model where the number of neutrino species is free. When we estimate the cosmological parameters for data including RSD, we found that the EOS parameter for dark energy is larger than that of the cosmological constant, and the effective number of neutrino species is smaller than the standard value, which infers a smaller present Hubble parameter $H_0$. From the viewpoint of cosmological tensions, the varying electron mass model with non-zero neutrino mass option looks promising to relax the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-process reconstructions and model building of quintom dark energy from latest cosmological observations</title>

Abstract: In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct the cosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations and divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy, respectively. Considering the effect of modified gravity on the growth of matter perturbations, the reconstruction results at the perturbative level show that we only need minor corrections to general relativity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical interpretation for the three different types of dynamical dark-energy behavior, in the framework of modified gravity, scalar fields, and dark-energy equation-of-state parametrizations. Finally, we show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.</description>

      <title>LEP3: A High-Luminosity e+e- Higgs and ElectroweakFactory in the LHC Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00541</link>

Abstract: As stated in the 2019 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), it is of the utmost importance that the HL-LHC upgrade of the accelerator and the experiments be successfully completed in a timely manner. All necessary efforts should be devoted to achieving this goal. We also recall two of the principal recommendations of the 2019 ESPP for future accelerator initiatives, namely that 1) An electron-positron Higgs factory is the highest priority for the next collider (Rec. c). 2) Europe, together with its international partners, should investigate the technical and financial feasibility of a future hadron collider at CERN with a centre-of-mass energy of at least 100 TeV and with an electron-positron Higgs and electroweak factory as a possible first stage (Rec. e). A major objective in particle physics is always to operate an accelerator that allows a leap of an order of magnitude in the constituent centre-of-mass energy with respect to the previous one. We support FCC-ee and FCC-hh as the preferred option for CERN future, as it addresses both of the above recommendations.
  The guidance for the 2025 ESPP requests, in addition to the preferred option, the inclusion of ``prioritised alternatives to be pursued if the chosen preferred option turns out not to be feasible or competitive''. Proposed alternatives to the preferred FCC option include linear, muon colliders and LHeC accelerators. In response to this request we propose reusing the existing LHC tunnel for an electron-positron collider, called LEP3, as a back-up alternative if the FCC cannot proceed. LEP3 leverages much of the R\&amp;D conducted for FCC-ee, offers high-precision studies of Z, W, and Higgs bosons below the tt threshold, and offers potential physics performance comparable or superior to other fallback options at a lower cost while supporting continued R\&amp;D towards a next-generation energy frontier machine.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>The Potential Impact of Primordial Black Holes on Exoplanet Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbits of planetary systems can be deformed from their initial configurations due to close encounters with larger astrophysical bodies. Typical candidates for close encounters are stars and binaries. We explore the prospect that if there is a sizeable population of primordial black holes (PBH) in our galaxy, then these may also impact the orbits of exoplanets. Specifically, in a simplified setting, we study numerically how many planetary systems might have a close encounter with a PBH, and analyze the potential changes to the orbital parameters of systems that undergo PBH flybys.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from the High-Redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) dark matter from the high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from MIKE/HIRES experiments. Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT) description of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict the Lyman-$\alpha$ fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles. Our EFT-based likelihood enables robust inference across redshifts $z = 4.2-5.4$ and down to scales of 100 kpc, within previously unexplored regions of parameter space for this dataset. We derive new bounds on the PBH fraction with respect to the total dark matter $f_{\text{PBH}}$, excluding populations with $f_{\text{PBH}} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ for masses $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 10^{4}-10^{16} M_{\odot}$. This offers the leading constraint for PBHs heavier than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and highlights the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a uniquely sensitive probe of new physics models that modify the structure formation history of our universe.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Nonlinear Extension of Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the most general form of our previously proposed nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics that possesses three basic properties. Unlike the simpler model, the new version is not completely integrable, but it has an underlying Hamiltonian structure. We analyze a particular solution in detail, and we use a natural extension of the Born rule to compute particle trajectories. We find that closed particle orbits are possible.</description>

      <title>Exploring parameter dependence of heavy-flavor dynamics in small collision systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations from high-multiplicity proton-lead ($p$-Pb) collisions indicate that small systems may exhibit collective behavior in both heavy and light hadrons. This work investigates the roles of initial- and final-state interactions in shaping the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of $D$ mesons measured in $p$-Pb collisions. Initial-state effects, including the Cronin and shadowing effects, are considered in the heavy-quark initial conditions, while final-state interactions are simulated through Langevin evolution combined with the coalescence model of hadronization. Different initial geometries attributed to fluctuations in the medium's energy density are parametrized and translated into the momentum anisotropies of both light and heavy quarks. The corresponding $R_{pPb}$ and $v_2$ of D mesons in 8.16 TeV $p$-Pb collisions are calculated under different assumptions for the final-state interactions. Assuming that the initial-state effects only modify the transverse momentum spectra without altering the azimuthal distribution of heavy quarks, the measured $R_{pPb}$ of D mesons can be qualitatively reproduced by the combined influence of initial- and final-state effects. However, the observed $v_2$ cannot be accounted for by final-state interactions alone. These results suggest that additional contributions to azimuthal anisotropies of heavy quarks originating from initial-state effects are required to explain the experimentally observed $v_2$.</description>
