      <title>A new GARCH model with a deterministic time-varying intercept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common for long financial time series to exhibit gradual change in the unconditional volatility. We propose a new model that captures this type of nonstationarity in a parsimonious way. The model augments the volatility equation of a standard GARCH model by a deterministic time-varying intercept. It captures structural change that slowly affects the amplitude of a time series while keeping the short-run dynamics constant. We parameterize the intercept as a linear combination of logistic transition functions. We show that the model can be derived from a multiplicative decomposition of volatility and preserves the financial motivation of variance decomposition. We use the theory of locally stationary processes to show that the quasi maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) of the parameters of the model is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We examine the quality of the asymptotic approximation in a small simulation study. An empirical application to Oracle Corporation stock returns demonstrates the usefulness of the model. We find that the persistence implied by the GARCH parameter estimates is reduced by including a time-varying intercept in the volatility equation.</description>

      <title>Robust Bond Risk Premia Predictability Test in the Quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from existing literature on testing the macro-spanning hypothesis of bond risk premia, which only considers mean regressions, this paper investigates whether the yield curve represented by CP factor (Cochrane and Piazzesi, 2005) contains all available information about future bond returns in a predictive quantile regression with many other macroeconomic variables. In this study, we introduce the Trend in Debt Holding (TDH) as a novel predictor, testing it alongside established macro indicators such as Trend Inflation (TI) (Cieslak and Povala, 2015), and macro factors from Ludvigson and Ng (2009). A significant challenge in this study is the invalidity of traditional quantile model inference approaches, given the high persistence of many macro variables involved. Furthermore, the existing methods addressing this issue do not perform well in the marginal test with many highly persistent predictors. Thus, we suggest a robust inference approach, whose size and power performance are shown to be better than existing tests. Using data from 1980-2022, the macro-spanning hypothesis is strongly supported at center quantiles by the empirical finding that the CP factor has predictive power while all other macro variables have negligible predictive power in this case. On the other hand, the evidence against the macro-spanning hypothesis is found at tail quantiles, in which TDH has predictive power at right tail quantiles while TI has predictive power at both tails quantiles. Finally, we show the performance of in-sample and out-of-sample predictions implemented by the proposed method are better than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Demystifying and avoiding the OLS "weighting problem": Unmodeled heterogeneity and straightforward solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers have long run regressions of an outcome variable (Y) on a treatment (D) and covariates (X) to estimate treatment effects. Even absent unobserved confounding, the regression coefficient on D in this setup reports a conditional variance weighted average of strata-wise average effects, not generally equal to the average treatment effect (ATE). Numerous proposals have been offered to cope with this "weighting problem", including interpretational tools to help characterize the weights and diagnostic aids to help researchers assess the potential severity of this problem. We make two contributions that together suggest an alternative direction for researchers and this literature. Our first contribution is conceptual, demystifying these weights. Simply put, under heterogeneous treatment effects (and varying probability of treatment), the linear regression of Y on D and X will be misspecified. The "weights" of regression offer one characterization for the coefficient from regression that helps to clarify how it will depart from the ATE. We also derive a more general expression for the weights than what is usually referenced. Our second contribution is practical: as these weights simply characterize misspecification bias, we suggest simply avoiding them through an approach that tolerate heterogeneous effects. A wide range of longstanding alternatives (regression-imputation/g-computation, interacted regression, and balancing weights) relax specification assumptions to allow heterogeneous effects. We make explicit the assumption of "separate linearity", under which each potential outcome is separately linear in X. This relaxation of conventional linearity offers a common justification for all of these methods and avoids the weighting problem, at an efficiency cost that will be small when there are few covariates relative to sample size.</description>
