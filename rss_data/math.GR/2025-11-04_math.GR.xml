      <title>Small Cancellation for Random Branched Covers of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a random model for an $n$-fold branched cover of a finite acceptable $2$-complex $X$. This includes presentation $2$-complexes for finitely presented groups satisfying some mild conditions. For any $\lambda &gt;0$, we show that as $n$ goes to infinity, a random branched cover asymptotically almost surely is homotopy equivalent to a $2$-complex satisfying geometric small cancellation $C'(\lambda)$. As a consequence the fundamental group of a random branched cover is asymptotically almost surely Gromov hyperbolic and has small cohomological dimension.</description>

      <title>Classification and lattice properties of pronormal subgroups in PSL(2,q), J1, and Sz(q) for the specified values of q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the classification of pronormal subgroups in the projective special linear groups PSL(2,q), the Suzuki groups of Lie type Sz(q), and the first Janko group J1, for the same ranges of q as in previous studies. Building on those works, we settle the remaining cases under the same parameter conditions. For each of these finite simple groups, the family of pronormal subgroups is closed under joins but not under meets. If the meet operation is replaced by a suitable operation, the family becomes a lattice.</description>

      <title>On Posets of Classes of Automorphic Subgroups of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [16], Tarnauceanu studied the poset Iso(G), of isomorphic classes of subgroups of a finite group G and proposed several questions for further research. In this paper, we study the poset AutCl(G), of classes of automorphic subgroups of finite group G. We introduce a partial order on AutCl(G) to tackle problem 5 mentioned in {\S}4 of [16]. More precisely, we prove that AutCl(Dn) and AutCl(Q4m) are distributive lattices. Moreover, we characterize all classes of finite groups for which AutCl(G) is a chain.</description>

      <title>A Group with Exactly One Noncommutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether there exists a finite group of order at least three in which every element except one is a commutator has remained unresolved in group theory. In this article, we address this open problem by developing an algorithmic approach that leverages several group theoretic properties of such groups. Specifically, we utilize a result of Frobenius and various necessary properties of such groups, combined with Plesken and Holt's extensive enumeration of finite perfect groups, to systematically examine all finite groups up to a certain order for the desired property. The computational core of our work is implemented using the computer system GAP (Groups, Algorithms, and Programming). We discover two nonisomorphic groups of order 368,640 that exhibit the desired property. Our investigation also establishes that this order is the minimum order for such a group to exist. As a result, this study provides a positive answer to Problem 17.76 in the Kourovka Notebook. In addition to the algorithmic framework, this paper provides a structural description of one of the two groups found.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of Lie incidence geometries with spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automorphism of a building is called uniclass if the Weyl distance between any chamber and its image lies in a unique (twisted) conjugacy class of the Coxeter group. In a previous paper we characterised uniclass automorphisms of spherical buildings in terms of their fixed structure. In the present paper we restrict to the simply laced case and characterise uniclass automorphisms in terms of a spectral gap property. More precisely, we show that an automorphism of a thick irreducible spherical building of simply laced type is uniclass if and only if no point of the long root subgroup geometry is mapped to distance $1$ or codistance $1$.</description>

      <title>On the directed normalizing graph associated with a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the $directed$ $normalizing$ $graph$ associated with a group $G$, defined as the simple directed graph whose vertices are the elements of $G$, with an arrow from $x$ to $y$ whenever the subgroup $\langle x \rangle$ is normal in $\langle x, y \rangle$. Our analysis focuses on the set of bidirectional universal vertices and, in particular, on the induced subgraph obtained by removing them, where the most interesting connectivity phenomena occur. We characterize the groups for which this induced subgraph is strongly connected and determine bounds for its diameter. Finally, we show how properties of this graph reflect algebraic features of the underlying group.</description>

      <title>Subnormalisers of semisimple elements in finite groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine subnormalisers of semisimple elements of prime power order in finite quasi-simple groups of Lie type. For this, we determine the maximal overgroups of normalisers of Sylow tori. This is motivated by the recent character correspondence conjecture by Moret\'o and Rizo as well as by the question of existence of quasi-semiregular elements in finite permutation groups.</description>

      <title>On Generalized Characters Whose Values on Nonidentity Elements are Sums of at Most Two Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A character of a finite group having degree $n$ takes values which may be expressed as sums of $n$ or fewer roots of unity. In this note, we prove a result which describes the irreducible constituents of generalized characters on abelian groups whose values on nonidentity elements are expressible as sums of two or fewer roots of unity. In Section 4, we apply our main result to obtain a result about the connected components of a certain subgraph of the prime graphs for groups admitting such generalized characters.</description>

      <title>The N-prime graph and the Subgroup Isomorphism Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a directed graph related to a group $G$, which we call the N-prime graph $\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(G)$ of $G$ and which is a refinement of the classical Gruenberg-Kegel graph. The vertices of $\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(G)$ are the primes $p$ such that $G$ has an element of order $p$, and, for distinct vertices $p$ and $q$, the arc $q\rightarrow p$ is in the graph if and only if $G$ has a subgroup of order $p$ whose normalizer in $G$ has an element of order $q$. Generalizing some known results about the Gruenberg-Kegel graph, we prove that the group $V(\mathbb{Z} G)$ of the units with augmentation $1$ in the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ has the same N-prime graph as $G$ if $G$ is a finite solvable group, and we reduce to almost simple groups the problem of whether $\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(V(\mathbb{Z} G))=\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(G)$ holds for any finite group $G$. We also prove that $\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(V(\mathbb{Z} G))=\Gamma_{\rm{N}}(G)$ if $G$ is almost simple with socle either an alternating group, or ${\rm{PSL}}(r^f)$ with $r$ prime and $f\le 2$. Finally, for $G$ solvable we obtain some stronger results which give a contribution to the Subgroup Isomorphism Problem. More precisely, we prove that if $V(\mathbb{Z} G)$ contains a Frobenius subgroup $T$ with kernel of prime order and complement of prime power order, then $G$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $T$.</description>

      <title>Lie Algebra Decomposition Classes for Reductive Algebraic Groups in Arbitrary Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decomposition classes provide a way of partitioning the Lie algebras of an algebraic group into equivalence classes based on the Jordan decomposition. In this paper, we investigate the decomposition classes of the Lie algebras of connected reductive algebraic groups, over algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic. We extend some results previously proved under restrictions on the characteristic, and introduce Levi-type decomposition classes to account for some of the difficulties encountered in bad characteristic. We also establish properties of Lusztig-Spaltenstein induction of non-nilpotent orbits, extending the known results for nilpotent orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the elements of $W(\tilde{A}_n)$ by giving a canonical reduced expression for each, using basic tools among which affine length. We give some direct consequences for such a canonical form: a description of left multiplication by a simple reflection, a study of the right descent set, and a proof that the affine length is preserved along the tower of affine Coxeter groups of type $\tilde A$, which implies in particular that the corresponding tower of affine Hecke algebras is a faithful tower regardless of the ground ring. We give a similar canonical reduced expression for the elements of $W(\tilde{B}_n)$ and $W(\tilde{D}_n)$.</description>

      <title>Percolation on graphs of polynomial growth is local: analyticity, supercritical sharpness, isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate locality of the supercritical regime for Bernoulli percolation on transitive graphs with polynomial growth, by which we mean the following. Take a transitive graph of polynomial growth $\mathscr{G}$ satisfying $p_c(\mathscr{G})&lt;1$ and take $p&gt;p_c(\mathscr{G})$. Let $\mathscr{H}$ be another such graph and assume that $\mathscr{G}$ and $\mathscr{H}$ have the same ball of radius $r$ for $r$ large. We prove that various quantities regarding percolation of parameter close to $p$ on $\mathscr{H}$ can be well understood from $(\mathscr{G},p)$ alone.
  This includes uniform versions of supercritical sharpness as well as the Kesten-Zhang bound on the probability of observing a large finite cluster: the constants involved can be chosen to depend only on $(\mathscr{G},p)$. We also prove that $\theta_\mathscr{H}$ is an analytic function of $p$ in the whole supercritical regime and that, for a suitable $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(\mathscr{G},p)&gt;0$, the analytic extension of $\theta_\mathscr{H}$ to the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $p$ in $\mathbb C$ is, uniformly, well approximated by the analytic extension of $\theta_\mathscr{G}$. The proof relies on new results on the connectivity of minimal cutsets; in particular, we answer a question asked by Babson and Benjamini in 1999. We further discuss connections with the conjecture of non-percolation at criticality.</description>

Abstract: Permutative automorphisms of the Cuntz algebras $\mathcal{O}_n$ are in bijection with the stable permutations of $[n]^k$. They are also the elements of the restricted Weyl group of $Aut(\mathcal{O}_n)$. In this note, we characterize a class of stable involutions of $[n]^2$. More precisely, we prove Conjecture 12.2 of Brenti and Conti [Adv. Math. 381 (2021), p. 60], and thus providing a new family (with $6$ degrees of freedom) of automorphisms of the Cuntz algebras $\mathcal{O}_n$ for any $n&gt;1$.</description>

Abstract: The action of $SL(2, {\bf Z})$ on the integer torus and its quotient by central symmetry and Artin's presentation of three strings braid group $B_{3}$, produces a presentation with parabolic generators $\pmatrix{1&amp; -1\cr 0&amp; 1\cr}$ and $\pmatrix{1&amp; 0\cr 1&amp; 1\cr}$. This braided presentation describes the action of the derived group on Poincar\'e's half plane and its quotient the modular torus, just as Nielsen's theorem giving the group of direct automorphisms of the free group on two generators as semi-direct product, amalgamated on the index $2$ subgroup of the center of $B_{3}$, of inner automorphisms with $B_{3}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the levelwise finite generation of free polynomial $G$-Tambara functors in a collection of cases, most notably when $G$ is a finite Dedekind group or when $G \cong C_p \rtimes C_q$, $p &gt; q$ primes. In the process, we establish the permanence of various finiteness conditions under box products and norms $n_H^G$ of Tambara functors, including a weak Hilbert Basis Theorem.</description>

      <title>Eventually periodic resolutions with applications to integral group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules over quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. Our approach utilizes a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically 'purge' homology from a complex. The construction is applied specifically to the integral group rings of groups with finite virtual cohomological dimension. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</description>

      <title>Between Whitehead groups and uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given stationary set $S$ of countable ordinals we prove (in $\mathbf{ZFC}$) that the assertion "every $S$-ladder system has $\aleph_0$-uniformization" is equivalent to "every strongly $\aleph_1$-free abelian group of cardinality $\aleph_1$ with non-freeness invariant $\subseteq S$ is $\aleph_1$-coseparable, i.e. Ext$(G, \oplus_{i=0}^{\infty} \mathbb Z)=0$ (in particular Whitehead, i.e.\ Ext$(G, \mathbb Z)=0$)". This solves problems B3 and B4 from Eklof and Mekler's monograph.</description>

      <title>Homology operations for gravity algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1}$ be the moduli space of genus zero Riemann surfaces with $n+1$ marked points. In this paper we compute $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $H_*^{\Sigma_n}(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1};\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1))$ for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and any prime $p$, where $\mathbb{F}_p(\pm 1)$ denotes the sign representation of the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$. The interest in these homology groups is twofold: on the one hand classes in these equivariant homology groups parametrize homology operations for gravity algebras. On the other hand the homotopy quotient $(\mathcal{M}_{0,n+1})_{\Sigma_n}$ is a model for the classifying space for $B_n/Z(B_n)$, the quotient of the braid group $B_n$ by its center.</description>

      <title>Almost unimodular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a locally compact group has open unimodular part if and only if the Plancherel weight on its group von Neumann algebra is almost periodic. We call such groups almost unimodular. The almost periodicity of the Plancherel weight allows one to define a Murray-von Neumann dimension for certain Hilbert space modules over the group von Neumann algebra, and we show that for finite covolume subgroups this dimension scales according to the covolume. Using this we obtain a generalization of the Atiyah-Schmid formula in the setting of second countable almost unimodular groups with finite covolume subgroups. Additionally, for the class of almost unimodular groups we present many examples, establish a number of permanence properties, and show that the formal degrees of irreducible and factorial square integrable representations are well behaved.</description>

      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from a nonderived $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and a nonderived $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>
