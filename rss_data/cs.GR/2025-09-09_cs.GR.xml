      <title>PaMO: Parallel Mesh Optimization for Intersection-Free Low-Poly Modeling on the GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the triangle count in complex 3D models is a basic geometry preprocessing step in graphics pipelines such as efficient rendering and interactive editing. However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit a few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation, a major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation. Second, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need to perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of sharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can take minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in practice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh optimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel re-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and intersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles; (2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free guarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the simplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by re-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm demonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k triangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090. We evaluated the approach on the Thingi10K dataset and showcased its exceptional performance in geometry preservation and speed.</description>

      <title>Programming tension in 3D printed networks inspired by spiderwebs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity, architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance. These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v) automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3 MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact, integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting structures in medical braces and splints.</description>

      <title>From Rigging to Waving: 3D-Guided Diffusion for Natural Animation of Hand-Drawn Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-drawn character animation is a vibrant field in computer graphics, presenting challenges in achieving geometric consistency while conveying expressive motion. Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric consistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and skirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models synthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in stylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation system that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse images are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for geometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary dynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an inpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions needing improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion realism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in the denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion model enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural deformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair Layering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair from the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters. Extensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>From Skin to Skeleton: Towards Biomechanically Accurate 3D Digital Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code, and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..</description>

      <title>Scaling Transformer-Based Novel View Synthesis Models with Token Disentanglement and Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data. As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

      <title>Exploring Urban Factors with Autoencoders: Relationship Between Static and Dynamic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges, visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while separate ones are useful in particular cases.</description>

      <title>SemLayoutDiff: Semantic Layout Generation with Diffusion Model for Indoor Scene Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent, realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.</description>

      <title>Hyper Diffusion Avatars: Dynamic Human Avatar Generation using Network Weight Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale, cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.</description>

      <title>The best approximation pair problem relative to two subsets in a normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical best approximation pair (BAP) problem, one is given two nonempty, closed, convex and disjoint subsets in a finite- or an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and the goal is to find a pair of points, each from each subset, which realizes the distance between the subsets. We discuss the problem in more general normed spaces and with possibly non-convex subsets, and focus our attention on the issues of uniqueness and existence of the solution to the problem. As far as we know, these fundamental issues have not received much attention. We present several sufficient geometric conditions for the (at most) uniqueness of a BAP. These conditions are related to the structure and the relative orientation of the boundaries of the subsets and to the norm. We also present many sufficient conditions for the existence of a BAP. Our results significantly extend the horizon of a recent algorithm for solving the BAP problem [Censor, Mansour, Reem, J. Approx. Theory (2024)]. The paper also shows, perhaps for the first time, how wide is the scope of the BAP problem in terms of the scientific communities which are involved in it (frequently independently) and in terms of its applications.</description>
