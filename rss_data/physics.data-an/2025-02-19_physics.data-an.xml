      <title>Recurrence threshold selection for obtaining robust recurrence characteristics in different embedding dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appropriate selection of recurrence thresholds is a key problem in applications of recurrence quantification analysis and related methods across disciplines. Here, we discuss the distribution of pairwise distances between state vectors in the studied system's state space reconstructed by means of time-delay embedding as the key characteristic that should guide the corresponding choice for obtaining an adequate resolution of a recurrence plot. Specifically, we present an empirical description of the distance distribution, focusing on characteristic changes of its shape with increasing embedding dimension. Our results suggest that selecting the recurrence threshold according to a fixed percentile of this distribution reduces the dependence of recurrence characteristics on the embedding dimension in comparison with other commonly used threshold selection methods. Numerical investigations on some paradigmatic model systems with time-dependent parameters support these empirical findings.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Based RFI Subtraction and Calibration for Radio Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04188v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio interferometry calibration and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) removal are usually done separately. Here we show that jointly modelling the antenna gains and RFI has significant benefits when the RFI follows precise trajectories, such as for satellites. One surprising benefit is improved calibration solutions, by leveraging the RFI signal itself. We present tabascal (TrAjectory BAsed RFI Subtraction and CALibration), a new algorithm that jointly models the RFI and calibration parameters in visibilities. We test tabascal on simulated MeerKAT calibration observations contaminated by satellite-based RFI. We obtain gain estimates that are both unbiased and up to an order of magnitude better constrained compared to uncontaminated data. When combined with an ad hoc RFI subtraction scheme, tabascal solutions can be further applied to an adjacent target observation: 5 minutes of calibration data results in an image with about a third the noise achieved when using flagging alone. The recovered flux distribution of RFI subtracted data was on par with uncontaminated data. In contrast, RFI flagging alone resulted in a higher detection threshold and consistent underestimation of source fluxes. For a mean RFI amplitude of 17 Jy, using RFI subtraction leads to less than 1% loss of data compared to 75% data loss from an ideal $3\sigma$ flagging algorithm, a very significant increase in data available for science analysis. Although we have examined the case of satellite RFI, tabascal should work for any RFI moving on parameterizable trajectories, relative to the phase centre, such as planes and/or objects fixed to the ground.</description>

      <title>TABASCAL II: Removing Multi-Satellite Interference from Point-Source Radio Astronomy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first TABASCAL paper we showed how to calibrate in the presence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) sources by simultaneously isolating the trajectories and signals of the RFI sources. Here we show that we can accurately remove RFI from simulated MeerKAT radio interferometry target data, for a single frequency channel, corrupted by up to 9 simultaneous satellites with average RFI amplitudes varying from weak to very strong (1 - 1000 Jy). Additionally, TABASCAL also manages to leverage the RFI signal-to-noise to phase calibrate the recovered astronomical signal. TABASCAL effectively performs a suitably phased up fringe filter for each RFI source which allows essentially perfect removal of RFI across all strengths. As a result, TABASCAL reaches image noises equivalent to the uncorrupted, no-RFI, case. Consequently, point-source science with TABASCAL almost matches the no-RFI case with near perfect completeness for all RFI amplitudes. In contrast the completeness of AOFlagger and idealised 3$\sigma$ flagging drops below 40% for strong RFI amplitudes where recovered flux errors are $\sim$10x-100x worse than those from TABASCAL. Finally we highlight that TABASCAL works for both static and varying astronomical sources.</description>

      <title>An a posteriori data-driven method for phase-averaged</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-averaging is a fundamental approach for investigating periodic and non-stationary phenomena. In fluid dynamics, these can be generated by rotating blades such as propellers/turbines or by pulsed jets. Traditional phase-averaging approaches often rely on synchronized data acquisition systems, which might require high-speed cameras, light sources, and precise delay generators and encoders, making them expensive and sometimes unfeasible. This work proposes an a posteriori data-driven approach that reconstructs phase information from randomly acquired uncorrelated photographic frames (snapshots) using the ISOMAP algorithm. The technique enables accurate reordering of snapshots in the phase space and subsequent computation of the phase-averaged flow field without the need for synchronization. The framework was validated through numerical simulations and experimental fluid dynamics datasets from an optical setup featuring single- and multi-propeller configurations. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures the periodic flow characteristics while addressing the challenges related to synchronization and hardware limitations. Furthermore, the ability to apply this technique to archival datasets extends its applicability to a wide range of experimental fluid dynamics studies. This approach provides a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for the analysis of periodic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Development of systematic uncertainty-aware neural network trainings for binned-likelihood analyses at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network training method capable of accounting for the effects of systematic variations of the data model in the training process and describe its extension towards neural network multiclass classification. The procedure is evaluated on the realistic case of the measurement of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion in the $\tau\tau$ decay channel at the CMS experiment. The neural network output functions are used to infer the signal strengths for inclusive production of Higgs bosons as well as for their production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion. We observe improvements of 12 and 16% in the uncertainty in the signal strengths for gluon and vector-boson fusion, respectively, compared with a conventional neural network training based on cross-entropy.</description>

      <title>Impact of Tracking Resolutions on $\phi$-Meson Spin Alignment Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of global spin alignment of vector mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can provide unique insights into spin-orbit interactions and vector meson dynamics in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in those collisions. The global spin alignment is measured by the $00^{\rm th}$ coefficient of the spin density matrix, $\rho_{00}$, via the polar angle ($\theta^{*}$) of the decay-daughter momentum in the parent rest frame with respect to the direction of the orbital angular momentum of the collision. Such measurements are affected by the angular and momentum resolutions of the reconstructed tracks in the experiment. Such effects are nontrivial because of kinematic complications caused by the boost to the parent rest frame, and could be important given that the global spin alignment signal is weak. In this paper, we investigate the effects of experimental tracking resolutions on measurements of the $\phi$(1020) meson $\rho_{00}$. We study these effects for two methods of $\rho_{00}$ measurements, the conventional method analyzing the $\phi$-meson yield versus $\cos^2 \theta^*$ and the invariant mass ($m_{\rm inv}$) method utilizing $\langle\cos^2\theta^*\rangle$ versus $m_{\rm inv}$. Using typical resolution values from experiments, we find that the effect of track resolution on $\rho_{00}$ is small, well within typical measurement uncertainties.</description>

      <title>In search of rogue waves: a novel proposal distribution for parallelized rejection sampling of the truncated KdV Gibbs measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gibbs ensemble of the truncated KdV (TKdV) equation has been shown to accurately describe the anomalous wave statistics observed in laboratory experiments, in particular the emergence of extreme events. Here, we introduce a novel proposal distribution that facilitates efficient rejection sampling of the TKdV Gibbs measure. Within parameter regimes accessible to laboratory experiments and capable of producing extreme events, the proposal distribution generates 1-6 orders of magnitude more accepted samples than does a naive, uniform distribution. When equipped with the new proposal distribution, a simple rejection algorithm enjoys key advantages over a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, include better parallelization properties and generation of uncorrelated samples.</description>

      <title>Evaluating many-body stabilizer R\'enyi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. Physically, we first separate the free energy contribution in $2$-SRE. At quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the characteristic function contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, by analyzing the volume-law correction of magic, which represents nonlocal magic residing in correlations, we find that its discontinuity is bound to critical properties and would be more useful than the full-state magic. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Distribution of singular values in large sample cross-covariance matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes. This extends the Marchenko-Pastur result for the distribution of eigenvalues of empirical sample covariance matrices to singular values of empirical cross-covariances. Our results will help to establish statistical significance of cross-correlations in many data-science applications.</description>

      <title>Characterizing nonlinear dynamics by contrastive cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The qualitative study of dynamical systems using bifurcation theory is key to understanding systems from biological clocks and neurons to physical phase transitions. Data generated from such systems can feature complex transients, an unknown number of attractors, and stochasticity. Making an analogy to bifurcation analysis, which specifies that useful dynamical features are often invariant to coordinate transforms, we leverage contrastive learning to devise a generic tool to discover dynamical classes from stochastic trajectory data. By providing a model-free trajectory analysis tool, this method automatically recovers the dynamical phase diagram of known models and provides a "map" of dynamical behaviors for a large ensemble of dynamical systems. The method thus provides a way to characterize and compare dynamical trajectories without governing equations or prior knowledge of target behavior. This approach can be used as a standalone analysis tool, or as part of a broader data-driven analysis framework.</description>
