      <title>New physics in spin entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with modified entanglement receive corrections.</description>

      <title>Consistent Excesses in the Search for $\tilde \chi_2^{\rm 0} \tilde \chi_1^{\rm \pm}$ : Wino/bino vs. Higgsino Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for supersymmetric (SUSY) particles is among the main search channels currently pursued at the LHC. Particularly, electroweak (EW) particles with masses as low as a few hundred GeV are still viable. Recent searches for the ``golden channel'', $pp \to \tilde \chi_2^{\rm 0} \tilde \chi_1^{\rm \pm} \to \tilde \chi_1^{\rm 0} Z^{(*)} \, \tilde \chi_1^{\rm 0} W^{\pm (*)}$ show consistent excesses between ATLAS and CMS in the 2~lepton, 3-lepton and mono-jet searches, assuming $m_{\tilde \chi_2^{\rm 0}} \approx m_{\tilde \chi_1^{\rm \pm}} \gtrsim 200$ GeV and $\Delta m := m_{\tilde \chi_2^{\rm 0}} - m_{\tilde \chi_1^{\rm 0}} \approx 20$ GeV. This mass configuration arises naturally in SUSY scenarios with wino/bino Dark Matter (DM) or higgsino DM. In these scenarios the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), assumed to be the lightest neutralino, as a DM candidate, is in good agreement with the observed limits on the DM content of the universe, as well as with negative results from Direct Detection (DD) experiments. We analyze these two scenarios with respect to the observed excesses, taking into account all relevant experimental constraints. We show that in particular wino/bino DM with different signs of the $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ soft SUSY-breaking parameters can describe well the experimental excesses, while being in agreement with all other constraints.</description>

      <title>The Flavor Composition of Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that standard matter effects in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae significantly constrain the flavor composition of the neutrino flux, even with the enormous uncertainties originating from self-induced flavor conversions in the supernova core. Under certain conditions, the neutrino flux resulting from self-induced conversions can be represented as a combination of flavor eigenstates in an arbitrary flavor ratio configuration. In this scenario, we find that, for the normal mass ordering, the fraction of neutrinos with electron flavor reaching the Earth, denoted as $f_{\nu_e}$, is constrained to be less than $0.5$ for all energies throughout the emission phase, whereas, for inverted mass ordering, we anticipate neutrinos arriving in near flavor equipartition ($f_{\nu_e}\approx 1/3$). In case adiabaticity is violated in the region of standard matter effects, the result is flavor equipartition for both mass orderings. Subsequently, we elaborate on the impact of wave-packet decoherence during self-induced conversions and explore alternative scenarios that could affect the aforementioned results.</description>

      <title>Higgs Pair Production in the 2HDM: Impact of Loop Corrections to the Trilinear Higgs Couplings and Interference Effects on Experimental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results obtained at the LHC for constraining the trilinear Higgs self-coupling of the detected Higgs boson at about 125 GeV, $\lambda_{hhh}$, via the Higgs pair production process have significantly improved during the last years. We investigate the impact of potentially large higher-order corrections and interference effects on the comparison between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions for the pair production of the 125 GeV Higgs boson at the LHC. We use the theoretical framework of the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), containing besides the SM-like ${\cal CP}$-even Higgs boson $h$ a second ${\cal CP}$-even Higgs boson $H$, which we assume to be heavier, $m_H &gt; m_h$. We analyze in particular the invariant mass distribution of the two produced Higgs bosons and show that the loop corrections to the trilinear Higgs couplings $\lambda_{hhh}$ and $\lambda_{hhH}$ as well as interference contributions give rise to important effects both for the differential and the total cross section. We point out the implications for the experimental limits that can be obtained in the 2HDM for the case of the resonant production of the heavy Higgs boson $H$. We emphasize the importance of the inclusion of interference effects between resonant and non-resonant contributions in the experimental analysis for a reliable determination of exclusion bounds for a heavy resonance of an extended Higgs sector.</description>

      <title>Four-body Semileptonic Decays $B\to D^*P\ell^+\nu_\ell$ with the SU(3) Flavor Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete study of the $B\to D^*P\ell^+\nu_\ell~(\ell=e,\mu,\tau)$ decays with the non-resonant, the charmed axial vector resonant and the charmed tensor resonant contributions by using the SU(3) flavor symmetry. Relevant amplitude relations between different decay modes are obtained by the SU(3) flavor symmetry. We then predict non-measured branching ratios of the $B\to D^*P\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays with the non-resonant and the charmed resonant contributions by using present experimental data of the $B\to D^*P\ell'^+\nu_{\ell'}~(\ell'=e,\mu)$ decays within $2\sigma$ errors. We have found that $B^{0,+}\to D^*\eta\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B^{0,+}\to D^*\eta'\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B^{0}_s\to D^*_s \eta\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B^{0}_s\to D^*_s\eta'\ell^+\nu_\ell$ and $B^{0,+}\to D^{*}_sK\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays only receive non-resonant contributions. Decays $B^0_s\to D_s^{*-}\pi^0\ell^+\nu_\ell$ only receive the $D'_{s1}$ resonant contributions. Other decays receive all three kinds of contributions, and three kinds of contributions are important in most of decays.</description>

      <title>Search for R-parity Violation induced Charged Lepton Flavor Violation at future lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in searches for Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) has continued in the past few decades since the observation of CLFV will indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). As several future lepton colliders with high luminosity have been proposed, the search for CLFV will reach an unprecedented level of precision. Many BSM models allow CLFV processes at the tree level, such as the R-parity-violating (RPV) Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), which is a good choice for benchmark. In this paper, we perform a detailed fast Monte Carlo simulation study on RPV-induced CLFV processes at future lepton colliders, including a 240 GeV circular electron positron collider (CEPC) and a 6 or 14 TeV muon collider. As a result, we found that the upper limits on the $\tau$ related RPV couplings will be significantly improved, while several new limits on RPV couplings can be set, which are inaccessible by low-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Heavy multiquark systems as clusters of smaller units -- a diffusion Monte Carlo calculation --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiquark systems appear less frequently than mesons and baryons despite the enormous world-wide experimental effort that has been made during the last two decades. In this work, we will propose a possible explanation for that fact, restricting ourselves to the case of sets including only $c$ and $\bar{c}$ quarks. We will show that those multiquarks can be thought as different combinations of smaller units that associate together to produce colorless assemblies with a definite value of the total spin. For instance, for the $cccccc$ hexaquark with $S=0$, we have three possibilities: a set of six undistinguishable $c$ quarks, an association of two $ccc$ baryons, or a set of three $cc$ diquarks close together. This means we can have three different values for the mass of an open-charm hexaquark with $S=0$. Using the diffusion Monte Carlo method, we calculate all possible combinations compatible with tetraquark $cc \bar{c} \bar{c}$, pentaquark $cccc \bar{c}$, open-charm $cccccc$ and hidden-charm $ccc \bar{c} \bar{c} \bar{c}$ hexaquark structures with the minimum value of total spin ($S=0$ or $S=1/2$). We consider compact structures with radial wave functions including interactions between all the quarks in the cluster. We find that, in all cases, the mass of the multiquark decreases with the number of small units that conform the set of quarks. For instance, an open charm hexaquark made up of three diquarks has a smaller mass than a set of six of $c$ undistinguishable units. When the pieces that conform the multiquark are themselves colorless with a definite value of the total spin, the cluster splits into those smaller units that separate infinitely from each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of benchmark scenarios for NMSSM Higgs boson searches via Higgs-to-Higgs decays at the LHC have been proposed by the NMSSM Subgroup of the LHC HWG3. Some of them are already in use by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for the interpretation of their results from Run 2. In this document we summarize the theory setup, the underlying procedures and reproduce the benchmark scenarios in table form.</description>

      <title>Probing gluon GTMDs of the proton in deep inelastic diffractive dijet production at HERA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate several differential distributions for diffractive dijets production in $e p \to e' {\rm jet \, jet} p$ in the pQCD dipole approach using off diagonal unintegrated gluon distributions (GTMDs). Different models from the literature are used. We concentrate on the contribution from exclusive $q \bar q$ dijets.
  Results of our calculations are compared to H1 and ZEUS data, including specific experimental cuts in our calculations. In general, except of one GTMD, our results are below the HERA data. The considered mechanism is expected to gives a sizeable contribution to the ZEUS data, while it is negligible in the kinematics of the H1 measurement.
  This is in contrast to recent results from the literature where the normalization was adjusted to some selected distributions of H1 collaboration and no agreement with other observables was checked.
  The ZEUS data provide stricter limitations on the GTMDs than the H1 data. We conclude, based on comparison to different observables, that the calculated cross sections are only a small fraction of the measured ones which contain probably also processes with pomeron remnant. Alternatively the experimental data could be explained by inclusion of $q \bar q g$ component.
  We present also azimuthal correlations between the sum and the difference of dijet transverse momenta. The cuts on transverse momenta of jets generate corresponding azimuthal correlations which can be misidentified as due to elliptic gluon distributions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of $S$- and $P$-wave $cc\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ $(\bar{q},\bar{q}' = \bar{u}, \bar{d}, \bar{s})$ systems in a chiral SU(3) quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the resonance $T_{cc}^+(3875)$ recently observed by the LHCb Collaboration, we systematically explore the $S$- and $P$-wave $cc\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ $(\bar{q},\bar{q}' = \bar{u}, \bar{d}, \bar{s})$ systems in a chiral SU(3) quark model. The Hamiltonian contains the kinetic energy, the one-gluon-exchange (OGE) potential, the confinement potential, and the one-boson-exchange (OBE) potential stemming from the coupling of quark and chiral fields. The Schr\"odinger equation is solved by use of the variational method with the spacial trial wave functions chosen as Gaussian functions. It is found that the lowest state has a mass $3879$ MeV, isospin and spin-parity $IJ^P=01^+$, and quark constituent $cc\bar{u}\bar{d}$, in agreement with the experimentally observed $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. This state is approximately at the calculated $DD^\ast$ threshold, and has a root-mean-square radius about $0.48$ fm. These demonstrates that the $T_{cc}^+(3875)$ can be accommodated as a stable and compact tetraquark sate in the chiral SU(3) quark model. All the other $S$- and $P$-wave $cc\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ $(\bar{q},\bar{q}' = \bar{u}, \bar{d}, \bar{s})$ states lie about one hundred to few hundreds MeV higher than the corresponding meson-meson thresholds, and thus are not suggested to be candidates of stable and compact tetraquark states due to their fall-apart decays to two mesons.</description>

      <title>The NNLO gluon beam function for jet-veto resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the gluon beam function for jet-veto resummation to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong-coupling expansion. Our calculation is based on an automated framework that was previously used for the computation of the respective quark beam function, and which we significantly extended for the present calculation. In particular, the perturbative matching kernels are directly calculated in momentum space, without the need to perform an additional Mellin transform. We present results for both gluon and quark-initiated processes, which we cross-checked with an independent semi-analytical method that exploits the similarity of the beam functions to the more familiar case of transverse-momentum resummation. Our computation is relevant for jet-veto resummations at NNLL$'$ accuracy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Sourced by Decay of Massive Particle from Primordial Black Hole evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) spectrum, resulting from the emission of gravitons through bremsstrahlung, in the decay of particles produced by Hawking radiation. Although particle decays inevitably entail the emission of graviton due to bremsstrahlung, the associated decay width is notably suppressed due to the Planck scale suppression in the coupling of matter fields to gravitons. Consequently, the relic abundance of such GWs constituted of these gravitons undergoes a corresponding reduction. However, we demonstrate that super-heavy particles, reaching masses as high as Planck scale, can emerge naturally in the Hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) and can compensate for this suppression. In addition, we also discuss the stochastic gravitational waves constituted out of the gravitons directly radiated from such evaporating PBHs. When the super-heavy particle decays promptly after its production, then the corresponding GW spectrum remains subdominant to the one arising from direct PBH evaporation. However, if this particle is long-lived and decays after PBH evaporation, then the resulting GWs produced in these two processes have two distinct spectra with their peaks at extremely high frequencies, providing avenues for proposed ultra-high frequency gravitational wave detectors. We also show that such gravitational waves contribute significantly to substantial dark radiation, well within the anticipated sensitivity thresholds of future experiments like CMB-S4 and EUCLID.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to baryon masses in the $1/N_c$ expansion of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryon mass operator is studied within a combined expansion in $1/N_c$ and perturbative $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry breaking, where $N_c$ denotes the number of quark charges. Flavor projection operators are used to classify the baryon operators involved in the expansion, which fall into the flavor representations $1$, $8$, $10+\overline{10}$, $27$, $35+\overline{35}$ and $64$. This approach allows one to incorporate up to third-order flavor symmetry breaking in the baryon mass operator in a rigorous and systematic way. Previous work on the subject is considered to validate the approach. A fit to data is performed to evaluate the free parameters in the theory and to produce some numerical values of baryon masses. Results are consistent and reaffirm the striking success of the $1/N_c$ expansion.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent Boosted Dark Matter from Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse neutrinos from past supernovae in the Universe present us with a unique opportunity to test dark matter (DM) interactions. These neutrinos can scatter and boost the DM particles in the Milky Way halo to relativistic energies allowing us to detect them in terrestrial laboratories. Focusing on generic models of DM-neutrino and electron interactions, mediated by a vector or a scalar boson, we implement energy-dependent scattering cross-sections and perform detailed numerical analysis of DM attenuation due to electron scattering in-medium while propagating towards terrestrial experiments. We set new limits on DM-neutrino and electron interactions for DM with masses in the range $\sim (0.1, 10^4)~$MeV, using recent data from XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, and PandaX-4T direct detection experiments. We demonstrate that consideration of energy-dependent cross-sections for DM interactions can significantly affect constraints previously derived under the assumption of constant cross-sections, modifying them by multiple orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Production of dark sector particles via resonant positron annihilation on atomic electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant positron annihilation on atomic electrons provides a powerful method to search for light new particles coupled to $e^+e^-$. Reliable estimates of production rates require a detailed characterization of electron momentum distributions. We describe a general method that harnesses the target material Compton profile to properly include electron velocity effects in resonant annihilation cross-sections. We additionally find that high $Z$ atoms can efficiently act as particle physics accelerators, providing a density of relativistic electrons that allows to extend by several times the experimental mass reach.</description>

      <title>PINNferring the Hubble Function with Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble function characterizes a given Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime and can be related to the densities of the cosmological fluids and their equations of state. We show how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) emulate this dynamical system and provide fast predictions of the luminosity distance for a given choice of densities and equations of state, as needed for the analysis of supernova data. We use this emulator to perform a model-independent and parameter-free reconstruction of the Hubble function on the basis of supernova data. As part of this study, we develop and validate an uncertainty treatment for PINNs using a heteroscedastic loss and repulsive ensembles.</description>

      <title>First investigation of void statistics in numerical relativity simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply and extend standard tools for void statistics to cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations with numerical relativity (NR). We obtain a simulated void catalogue without Newtonian approximations, using a new watershed void finder which operates on fluid-based NR simulations produced with the Einstein Toolkit. We compare and contrast measures of void size and void fraction, and compare radial stacked density profiles to empirically-derived Hamaus-Sutter-Wandelt (HSW) density profiles and profiles based on distance to void boundaries. We recover statistics roughly consistent with Newtonian N-body simulations where such a comparison is meaningful. We study variation of dynamical spatial curvature and local expansion explicitly demonstrating the spatial fluctuations of these quantities in void regions. We find that voids in our simulations expand ~10-30% faster than the global average and the kinetic curvature density parameter in the centre of voids reaches ~60-80%. Within the limits of resolution of the simulations, the results are consistent with the parameters of the Timescape model of cosmological backreaction.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission spectrum for axion-photon conversion in magnetospheres of strongly magnetized neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting axionic dark matter (DM) could be possible in an X-ray spectrum from strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs). We examine the possibility of axion-photon conversion in the magnetospheres of strongly magnetized NSs. In the current work, we investigate how the modified Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV) system of equations (in the presence of a magnetic field) affects the energy spectrum of axions and axions-converted photon flux. We have considered the distance-dependent magnetic field in the modified TOV equations. We employ three different equations of states (EoSs) to solve these equations. We obtain the axions emission rate by including the Cooper-pair-breaking formation process (PBF) and Bremsstrahlung process in the core of NSs using the NSCool code. We primarily focus on three NSs: PSR B0531+21, PSR J0538+2817, and one Magnificient seven (M7) star RXJ 1856.5-3754. We further investigate the impact of the magnetic field on the actual observables, such as axion`s energy spectrum and axion-photon flux. We also compare our calculated axion-photon flux from all available archival data from PN+MOS+Chandra. Our predicted axion-photon flux values as a function of axion`s energy closely follow the experimentally archival data, which allows us to put bounds on the axion`s mass for the three different EoS.13</description>

      <title>Might Normal Nuclear Matter be Quarkyonic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that nuclear matter might be Quarkyonic is considered. Quarkyonic matter is high baryon density matter that is confined but can be approximately thought of as a filled Fermi sea of quarks surrounded by a shell of nucleons. Here, nuclear matter is described by the IdylliQ sigma model for Quarkyonic matter, generalizing the non-interacting IdylliQ model [Y. Fujimoto et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 112701 (2024) [arXiv:2306.04304]] to include interactions with a sigma meson and a pion. When such interactions are included, we find that isospin-symmetric nuclear matter binds, with acceptable values of the compressibility and other parameters for nuclear matter at saturation. The energy per nucleon and sound velocity of such matter is computed, and the isospin dependence is determined. Nuclear matter is formed at a density close to but slightly above the density at which Quarkyonic matter forms. Quarkyonic matter predicts a strong depletion of nucleons in normal nuclear matter at low momentum. Such a depletion for nucleon momenta $k \lesssim 120$ MeV is shown to be consistent with electron scattering data.</description>

      <title>Production of Chern-Simons bosons in decays of mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14500v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the effective interaction of quarks with a new GeV-scale vector particle that couples to electroweak gauge bosons by the so-called effective Chern-Simons interaction. We call this particle the Chern-Simons (CS) boson. We construct an effective Lagrangian of the CS boson interaction with quarks of two different flavors. This interaction is given by a divergent loop diagram, however, it turns out that the divergent part is equal to zero as a consequence of the CKM matrix unitarity in the SM. Therefore, we are able to predict the effective interaction of the CS boson with quarks of different flavors without introducing new unknown parameters to the model, using only parameters of the initial effective Lagrangian. Our result shows that the effective interaction of the CS boson with down-type quarks is sufficiently stronger compared with up-type quarks. Based on our results, we give a prediction for the production of CS bosons in mesons decays. Branching fractions were obtained for the main reactions of the CS production in meson decays. The results obtained will be useful for searching for the long-lived GeV-scale CS boson in intensity frontier experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from phase transitions and cosmic strings in neutrino mass models with multiple majorons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the origin of Majorana masses within the majoron model and how this can lead to the generation of a distinguishable primordial stochastic background of gravitational waves. We first show how in the simplest majoron model only a contribution from cosmic string can be within the reach of planned experiments. We then consider extensions containing multiple complex scalars, demonstrating how in this case a spectrum comprising contributions from both a strong first order phase transition and cosmic strings can naturally emerge. We show that the interplay between multiple scalar fields can amplify the phase transition signal, potentially leading to double peaks over the wideband sloped spectrum from cosmic strings. We also underscore the possibility of observing such a gravitational wave background to provide insights into the reheating temperature of the universe. We conclude highlighting how the model can be naturally combined with scenarios addressing the origin of matter of the universe, where baryogenesis occurs via leptogenesis and a right-handed neutrino plays the role of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictivity of many non-thermal dark matter (DM) models is marred by the gravitational production background. This problem is ameliorated in models with lower reheating temperature $T_R$, which allows for dilution of gravitationally produced relics. We study the freeze-in dark matter production mechanism in the thermal bath with the electroweak scale temperature. The process is Boltzmann-suppressed if the dark matter mass is above $T_R$. In this case, the coupling to the thermal bath has to be significant to account for the observed dark matter relic density. As a result, the direct DM detection experiments already probe such freeze-in models, excluding significant parts of parameter space. The forthcoming experiments will explore this framework further, extending to lower couplings and higher reheating temperatures.</description>

      <title>Supercooling in Radiative Symmetry Breaking: Theory Extensions, Gravitational Wave Detection and Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) polarization in proton-proton collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using PYTHIA8</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production mechanisms of charmonium states in both hadronic and heavy-ion collisions hold great significance for investigating the hot and dense QCD matter. Studying charmonium polarization in ultra-relativistic collisions can also provide insights into the underlying production mechanisms. With this motivation, we explore the $J/\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) polarization in proton+proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7, 8, and 13 TeV using a pQCD-inspired Monte-Carlo event generator called PYTHIA8. This work considers reconstructed quarkonia through their dimuons decay channel in the ALICE forward rapidity acceptance range of $2.5 &lt; y_{\mu \mu} &lt; 4$. Further, we calculate the polarization parameters $\lambda_{\theta}$, $\lambda_{\phi}$, $\lambda_{\theta \phi}$ from the polar and azimuthal angular distributions of the dimuons in helicity and Collins-Soper frames. This study presents a comprehensive measurement of the polarization parameters as a function of transverse momentum, charged-particle multiplicity, and rapidity at the LHC energies. Our findings of charmonium polarization are in qualitative agreement with the corresponding experimental data.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Axion-Gauge Couplings and Non-Invertible Higher Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive model-independent quantization conditions on the axion couplings (sometimes known as the anomaly coefficients) to the Standard Model gauge group $[SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)_Y]/\mathbb{Z}_q$ with $q=1,2,3,6$. Using these quantization conditions, we prove that any QCD axion model to the right of the $E/N=8/3$ line on the $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}|$-$m_a$ plot must necessarily face the axion domain wall problem in a post-inflationary scenario. We further demonstrate the higher-group and non-invertible global symmetries in the Standard Model coupled to a single axion. These generalized global symmetries lead to universal bounds on the axion string tension and the monopole mass. If the axion were discovered in the future, our quantization conditions could be used to constrain the global form of the Standard Model gauge group.</description>

      <title>Fast Exact Algorithm for Neutrino Oscillation in Constant Matter Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently published method for solving the neutrino evolution equation with constant matter density is further refined and used to lay out an exact algorithm for computing oscillation probabilities, which is moderately faster than previous methods when looping through neutrinos of different energies. In particular, the three examples of $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival, $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_\mu$ survival and $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ appearance probabilities are written in terms of mixing angles, mass differences and matter electron density. A program based on this new method is found to be roughly twice as fast as, and in agreement with, the leading GLoBES package. Furthermore, the behaviour of all relevant effective parameters is sketched out in terms of a range of neutrino energies, or matter electron densities. For instance, the $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle{(-)}}{\nu}_e$ survival probability in constant matter density is found to have no dependence on the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ or the CP-violating phase $\delta_{13}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting models that enhance $B^+\to K^+ \nu\bar\nu$ in light of the new Belle II measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Belle II has recently reported the new measurement ${\cal B}(B^+\to K^+\nu\bar\nu)=(2.3\pm0.7)\times 10^{-5}$ \cite{Belle-II:2023esi} which is two times larger than their previous result (although consistent within errors) and about $2.7\,\sigma$ higher than the SM prediction. We re-examine new physics scenarios we have discussed previously which can enhance this rate to determine if they can accommodate the higher value reported in the new measurement. We use consistency with existing bounds on $B\to K^*\nu\bar\nu$, $b\to s \ell^+\ell^-$, $B\to D^{(*)}\ell\bar\nu$ and $B_s$ mixing to limit possible explanations for the excess. For the case of LFV neutrino couplings, we find that only two leptoquarks remain viable requiring a large $C_{9^\prime}^{\tau\tau}=-C_{10^\prime}^{\tau\tau}$. For models with different types of light dark matter particle pairs (scalar, fermion, or vector), the preliminary $q^2$ distribution from Belle II, which shows that the excess appears mostly for bins with $3\leq q^2\leq7$ GeV$^2$ \cite{Belle-II:2023esi}, implies only the vector current operators with scalar or vector dark matter particles with masses in the hundreds of MeV can match the anomaly.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical generation of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $B_{s0}^*$ mesons using a meson-exchange model with a coupled-channel formalism. Our primary focus is on the $D_s^+\pi^0$ channel below the $DK$ threshold. First, we construct the invariant kernel amplitudes, incorporating effective Lagrangians based on heavy-quark symmetry, flavor SU(3) symmetry, and hidden local symmetry. Since the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ state implies isospin symmetry breaking, we introduce $\pi^0-\eta$ isospin mixing. We subsequently solve the coupled-channel integral equations, which include sixteen different channels. We carefully analyze how the pole corresponding to the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ state emerges from the coupled channels. Our findings reveal that the pole positions of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson are at $\sqrt{s}_R=(2317.9 - i 0.0593)$ MeV and the $B_{s0}^*$ meson at $(5756.3- i 0.0228)$ MeV. We also discuss their decay widths. In conclusion, our current results provide a clear indication supporting the interpretation of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ meson as a molecular state within the present coupled-channel formalism. The $B_{s0}^*$ can also be predicted as a molecular one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of vectorlike fermions that have the same gauge charges as the Standard Model lepton doublets, but opposite lepton number. These antileptons undergo decays mediated by heavier scalar leptoquarks, while the symmetries of this renormalizable model protect the vectorlike fermions and the leptoquarks from standard decays probed so far at colliders. If the new particles couple predominantly to second-generation quarks, then their collider probes involve multiple jets and two taus or neutrinos, and are hampered by large backgrounds. If couplings to third-generation quarks are large, then the collider signals involve top quarks, and can be probed more efficiently at the LHC. Even in that case, both the vectorlike fermion doublet and the leptoquarks remain more elusive than in models with standard decays.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the neutron lifetime puzzle, a discrepancy between beam and bottle measurements of the weak neutron decay. Since both types of measurements are realized at different times after the nuclear production of free neutrons, we argue that the existence of an excited state could be responsible for the different lifetimes. We elaborate on the required properties of such a state and construct a concrete toy model with several of the required characteristics.</description>

      <title>Rotation effect on the deconfinement phase transition in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of rotation on the deconfinement phase transition under the EM system of the soft and the hard wall models in holographic QCD is studied in this paper. The metric by cylindrical coordinates with rotation is introduced into the system to calculate the Hawking temperature. The first holographic study on the influence of the radius of a homogeneous rotating system on the phase diagram is proposed. It is found that the phase transition temperature hardly changes with the rotation angular velocity for a small rotation radius. Only with a larger rotation radius can the change in rotational angular velocity significantly alter the phase transition temperature. The phase transition temperature decreases rapidly with the increase of rotation angular velocity as the rotation radius increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In processes taking place at energies much higher than the weak scale, electroweak corrections can be taken into account by using electroweak evolution equations, that are analogous to the DGLAP equations in QCD. We show that weak isospin conservation in these equations imposes to modify the expressions of the splitting functions commonly used in the literature. These modifications have a profound impact on the parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Model-independent predictions for decays of double-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double-heavy hadrons can decay into pairs of heavy hadrons through transitions from confining Born-Oppenheimer potentials to hadron-pair potentials with the same Born-Oppenheimer quantum numbers. The transitions are also constrained by conservation of angular momentum and parity. From these constraints, we derive model-independent selection rules for decays of double-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons. The coupling potentials are expressed as sums of products of Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitudes and angular-momentum coefficients. If there is a single dominant Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitude, it factors out of the coupling potentials between double-heavy hadrons in the same Born-Oppenheimer multiplet and pairs of heavy hadrons in specific heavy-quark-spin-symmetry doublets. If furthermore the kinetic energies of the heavy hadrons are much larger than their spin splittings, we obtain analytic expressions for the relative partial decay rates in terms of Wigner 6-j and 9-j symbols. We consider in detail the decays of quarkonia and quarkonium hybrids into the lightest heavy-meson pairs. For quarkonia, our model-independent selection rules and relative partial decay rates agree with previous results from quark-pair-creation models in simple cases and give stronger results in other cases. For quarkonium hybrids, we find disagreement even in simple cases.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Vector-Like Bottom-Quark Models in the Alignment Limit of the 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expanding upon our ongoing investigation of Vector-Like Quark (VLQ) phenomenology within a 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) framework, in this paper, we complement a previous one dedicated to Vector-Like Top-quarks (VLTs) by studying Vector-Like Bottom-quarks (VLBs), specifically focusing on their behavior in the alignment limit of a Type-II Yukawa structure. We examine the potential for detecting VLBs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and analyze their decay signatures, encompassing both Standard Model (SM) processes and exotic decays. The objective is to differentiate among singlet, doublet, and triplet configurations of VLBs by identifying distinct decay patterns, thereby providing insights into the structure of Beyond the SM (BSM) physics.</description>

      <title>Negative moment of inertia and rotational instability of gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principle numerical simulations of the lattice SU(3) gauge theory, we calculate the isothermal moment of inertia of the rigidly rotating gluon plasma. We find that the moment of inertia unexpectedly takes a negative value below the "supervortical temperature" $T_s = 1.50(10) T_c$, vanishes at $T = T_s$, and becomes a positive quantity at higher temperatures. The negative moment of inertia indicates a thermodynamic instability of rigid rotation. We derive the condition of thermodynamic stability of the vortical plasma and show how it relates to the scale anomaly and the magnetic gluon condensate. The rotational instability of gluon plasma shares a striking similarity with the rotational instabilities of spinning Kerr and Myers-Perry black holes.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Model for Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a parametric model for studying self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The model uses an analytical density profile, calibrated using a controlled N-body SIDM simulation that covers the entire gravothermal evolution, including core-forming and -collapsing phases. By normalizing the calibrated density profile, we obtain a universal description for SIDM halos at any evolution phase. The model allows us to infer properties of SIDM halos based on their cold dark matter (CDM) counterparts. As a basic application, we only require two characteristic parameters of an isolated CDM halo at $z=0$. We then extend the model to incorporate effects induced by halo mass changes, such as major mergers or tidal stripping, making it applicable to both isolated halos and subhalos. The parametric model is tested and validated using cosmological zoom-in SIDM simulations available in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moduli stabilisation is key to obtaining phenomenologically viable string models. Non-geometric compactifications, like T-duality orbifolds (T-folds), are capable of freezing many moduli. However, in this Letter we emphasise that T-folds, admitting free fermionic descriptions, can be associated with a large number of different T-folds with varying number of moduli, since the fermion pairings for bosonisation are far from unique. Consequently, in one description a fermionic construction might appear to be asymmetric, and hence non-geometric, while in another it admits a symmetric orbifold description. We introduce the notion of intrinsically asymmetric T-folds for fermionic constructions that do not admit any symmetric orbifold description after bosonisation. Finally, we argue that fermion symmetries induce mappings in the bosonised description that extend the T-duality group.</description>

      <title>Limits on dark matter annihilation in prompt cusps from the isotropic gamma-ray background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that thermally produced dark matter will form highly concentrated, low-mass cusps in the early universe that often survive until the present. While these cusps contain a small fraction of the dark matter, their high density significantly increases the expected gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation, particularly in searches of large angular regions. We utilize 14 years of Fermi-LAT data to set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation through a detailed study of the isotropic gamma-ray background, excluding with 95% confidence dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states for dark matter masses below 120 GeV.</description>

      <title>Open Quantum Systems with Kadanoff-Baym Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the temporal evolution of quantum mechanical fermionic particles exhibiting one bound state within a one-dimensional attractive square-well potential in a heat bath of bosonic particles. For this open quantum system we formulate the non-equilibrium Kadanoff-Baym equations for the system particles by taking the interactions to be elastic 2-2 scatterings with the heat-bath particles. The corresponding spatially imhomogeneous integro-differential equations for the one-particle Greens's function are solved numerically. We demonstrate how the system particles equilibrate and thermalize with the heat bath and how the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, expressed in the one-particle energy eigenbasis, decohere, so that only the diagonal entries, i.e. the occupation numbers, survive. In addition, the time evolution of the (retarded) Green's function also determines the spectral properties of the various one-particle quantum states.</description>

      <title>CMB delensing with deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) stands as a pivotal source for studying weak gravitational lensing. While the lensed CMB aids in constraining cosmological parameters, it simultaneously smooths the original CMB's features. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB showcases sharper acoustic peaks and more pronounced damping tails, enhancing the precision of inferring cosmological parameters that influence these aspects. Although delensing diminishes the $B$-mode power spectrum, it facilitates the pursuit of primordial gravitational waves and enables a lower variance reconstruction of lensing and additional sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net++ algorithm, to play a pivotal role in CMB delensing. We analyze three fields, namely $T$, $Q$, and $U$ sky maps, present the angular power spectra of the CMB delensed $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. Our findings reveal that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB, processed by U-Net++, closely aligns with that of the unlensed CMB. Thus, U-Net++ based CMB delensing proves to be effective in mitigating the impacts of weak gravitational lensing, paving the way for enhancing the CMB delensing power spectrum in forthcoming CMB experiments. The code utilized for this analysis is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Transversity PDFs of the proton from lattice QCD with physical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the transversity isovector- and isoscalar-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton utilizing a perturbative matching at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy. Additionally, we determine the isovector and isoscalar tensor charges for the proton. In both calculations, the disconnected contributions to the isoscalar matrix elements have been ignored. The calculations are performed using a single ensemble of $N_f = 2 +1$ highly-improved staggered quarks simulated with physical-mass quarks and a lattice spacing of $a = 0.076$ fm. The Wilson-clover action, with physical quark masses and smeared gauge links obtained from one iteration of hypercubic smearing, is used in the valence sector. Using the NLO operator product expansion, we extract the lowest four to six Mellin moments and the PDFs via a neural network from the matrix elements in the pseudo-PDF approach. In addition, we calculate the PDFs in the quasi-PDF approach with hybrid-scheme renormalization and the recently developed leading-renormalon resummation technique, at NLO with the resummation of leading small-$x$ logarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that crossing symmetry of S-matrices is modified in certain theories with non-invertible symmetries or anomalies. Focusing on integrable flows to gapped phases in two dimensions, we find that S-matrices derived previously from the bootstrap approach are incompatible with non-invertible symmetries along the flow. We present consistent alternatives, which however violate standard crossing symmetry and obey modified rules dictated by fusion categories. We extend these rules to theories with discrete anomalies.</description>
