      <title>Stationary distribution approximations of Two-island Wright-Fisher and seed-bank models using Stein's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two finite population Markov chain models, the two-island Wright-Fisher model with mutation, and the seed-bank model with mutation. Despite the relatively simple descriptions of the two processes, the the exact form of their stationary distributions is in general intractable. For each of the two models we provide two approximation theorems with explicit upper bounds on the distance between the stationary distributions of the finite population Markov chains, and either the stationary distribution of a two-island diffusion model, or the beta distribution. We show that the order of the bounds, and correspondingly the appropriate choice of approximation, depends upon the relative sizes of mutation and migration. In the case where migration and mutation are of the same order, the suitable approximation is the two-island diffusion model, and if migration dominates mutation, then the weighted average of both islands is well approximated by a beta random variable. Our results are derived from a new development of Stein's method for the stationary distribution of the two-island diffusion model for the weak migration results, and utilising the existing framework for Stein's method for the Dirichlet distribution.</description>

      <title>Spectral measure of large random Helson matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18796v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limiting spectral measure of large random Helson matrices and large random matrices of certain patterned structures.
  Given a real random variable $X \in L^{2+ \varepsilon}(\mathbb{P}) $ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\mathrm{Var}(X) = 1$. For the Helson matrices generated by the independent copies of $X$, scaling the eigenvalues by $\sqrt{n}$, we prove the almost sure weak convergence of the spectral measure to the standard semi-circular law. Similar results are established for large random matrices with certain general patterned structures.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the steady state for piecewise stable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes arising in queueing networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We shall use the Euler-Maruyama (EM) scheme with decreasing step size $\Lambda=(\eta_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ to approximate the steady state for piecewise $\alpha$-stable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes arising in queue networks. These processes do not have an explicit dissipation. We prove the EM scheme converges to the steady state with a rate $\eta^{1/\alpha}_n$ in Wasserstein-1 distance. In addition, we utilize the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm to compute the Wasserstein-1 distance and conduct the simulations for several examples.</description>

      <title>Flow-distribution dependent SDEs and Navier-Stokes equations with $\mathbf f$B$\mathbf m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the probabilistic representation of the Navier-Stokes equations, we introduce a novel class of stochastic differential equations that depend on flow distribution. We establish the existence and uniqueness of both strong and weak solutions under one-sided Lipschitz conditions and singular drifts. These newly proposed flow-distribution dependent stochastic differential equations are closely connected to quasilinear backward Kolmogorov equations and forward Fokker-Planck equations. Furthermore, we investigate a stochastic version of the 2D-Navier-Stokes equation associated with fractional Brownian noise. We demonstrate the global well-posedness and smoothness of solutions when the Hurst parameter $H$ lies in the range $(0, \frac12)$ and the initial vorticity is a finite signed measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof of almost sure invertibility of unsymmetric random Kansa collocation matrices by a class of analytic RBF vanishing at infinity, for the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Such a class includes popular Positive Definite instances such as Gaussians, Generalized Inverse MultiQuadrics and Matern RBF. The proof works on general domains in any dimension, with any distribution of boundary collocation points and any continuous random distribution of internal collocation points.</description>

      <title>Covariance Operator Estimation via Adaptive Thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies sparse covariance operator estimation for nonstationary Gaussian processes with sharply varying marginal variance and small correlation lengthscale. We introduce a covariance operator estimator that adaptively thresholds the sample covariance function using an estimate of the variance components. Building on recent results from empirical process theory, we derive an operator norm bound on the estimation error in terms of the sparsity level of the covariance and the expected supremum of the normalized process. Our theory and numerical simulations demonstrate the advantage of adaptive threshold estimators over universal threshold and sample covariance estimators in nonstationary settings.</description>

      <title>Best Ergodic Averages via Optimal Graph Filters in Reversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of finding the best ergodic or Birkhoff averages in the ergodic theorem to ensure rapid convergence to a desired value, using graph filters. Our approach begins by representing a function on the state space as a graph signal, where the (directed) graph is formed by the transition probabilities of a reversible Markov chain. We introduce a concept of graph variation, enabling the definition of the graph Fourier transform for graph signals on this directed graph. Viewing the iteration in the ergodic theorem as a graph filter, we recognize its non-optimality and propose three optimization problems aimed at determining optimal graph filters. These optimization problems yield the Bernstein, Chebyshev, and Legendre filters. Numerical testing reveals that while the Bernstein filter performs slightly better than the traditional ergodic average, the Chebyshev and Legendre filters significantly outperform the ergodic average, demonstrating rapid convergence to the desired value.</description>

      <title>Fractional diffusion as the limit of a short range potential Rayleigh gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional diffusion equation is rigorously derived as a scaling limit from a deterministic Rayleigh gas, where particles interact via short range potentials with support of size $\varepsilon$ and the background is distributed in space $R^3$ according to a Poisson process with intensity $N$ and in velocity according some fat-tailed distribution. As an intermediate step a linear Boltzmann equation is obtained in the Boltzmann-Grad limit as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero and $N$ tends to infinity with $N \varepsilon^2 =c$. The convergence of the empiric particle dynamics to the Boltzmann-type dynamics is shown using semigroup methods to describe probability measures on collision trees associated to physical trajectories in the case of a Rayleigh gas. The fractional diffusion equation is a hydrodynamic limit for times $t \in [0,T]$, where $T$ and inverse mean free path $c$ can both be chosen as some negative rational power $\varepsilon^{-k}$.</description>

      <title>Annealed Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates for elliptic operators with random coefficients on $C^{1}$ domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concerned with elliptic operators with stationary random coefficients governed by linear or nonlinear mixing conditions and bounded (or unbounded) $C^1$ domains, this paper mainly studies (weighted) annealed Calder\'on-Zygmund estimates, some of which are new even in a periodic setting. Stronger than some classical results derived by a perturbation argument in the deterministic case, our results own a scaling-invariant property, which additionally requires the non-perturbation method (based upon a quantitative homogenization theory and a set of functional analysis techniques) recently developed by M. Joisen and F. Otto \cite{Josien-Otto22}. To handle boundary estimates in certain UMD (unconditional martingale differences) spaces, we hand them over to Shen's real arguments \cite{Shen05, Shen23} instead of using Mikhlin's theorem. As a by-product, we also established ``resolvent estimates''. The potentially attractive part is to show how the two powerful kernel-free methods work together to make the results clean and robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha \colon \mathbb{N} \to S^1$ be the Steinhaus multiplicative function: a completely multiplicative function such that $(\alpha(p))_{p\text{ prime}}$ are i.i.d. random variables uniformly distributed on $S^1$. Helson conjectured that $\mathbb{E}|\sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)|=o(\sqrt{x})$ as $x \to \infty$, and this was solved in strong form by Harper. We give a short proof of the conjecture using a result of Saksman and Webb on a random model for the Riemann zeta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approach to the theory of a relativistic random process is considered by the path integral method as Brownian motion taking into account the boundedness of speed. An attempt was made to build a relativistic analogue of the Wiener measure as a weak limit of finite-difference approximations. A formula has been proposed for calculating the probability particle transition during relativistic Brownian motion. Calculations were carried out by three different methods with identical results. Along the way, exact and asymptotic formulas for the volume of some parts and sections of an N-1-dimensional unit cube were obtained. They can have independent value.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates on the size of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to uniform-in-time concentration estimates and to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an optimal transport problem with backward martingale constraint. The objective function is given by the scalar product of a pseudo-Euclidean space $S$. We show that the supremums over maps and plans coincide, provided that the law $\nu$ of the input random variable $Y$ is atomless. An optimal map $X$ exists if $\nu$ does not charge any $c-c$ surface (the graph of a difference of convex functions) with strictly positive normal vectors in the sense of the $S$-space. The optimal map $X$ is unique if $\nu$ does not charge $c-c$ surfaces with nonnegative normal vectors in the $S$-space. As an application, we derive sharp conditions for the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium in a multi-asset version of the model with insider from Rochet and Vila [10]. In the linear-Gaussian case, we characterize Kyle's lambda, the sensitivity of price to trading volume, as the unique positive solution of a non-symmetric algebraic Riccati equation.</description>

Abstract: In a separable Hilbert space, we study supercontractivity and ultracontractivity properties for a transition semigroups associated with a stochastic partial differential equations. This is done in terms of exponential integrability of Lipschitz functions and some logarithmic Sobolev-type inequalities with respect to invariant measures. The abstract characterization results concerning the improving of summability can be applied to transition semigroups associated to a stochastic reaction-diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Diffusion approximation of the stationary distribution of a two-level single server queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a single server queue which has a threshold to change its arrival process and service rate by its queue length, which is referred to as a two-level single server queue. This model is motivated by an energy saving problem for a single server queue whose arrival process and service rate may be changed. To get its performance in tractable form, we study in the limit of the stationary distribution of this two-level queue under a certain scaling in heavy traffic, which corresponds to a diffusion approximation. It is shown that this limiting distribution is truncated exponential below the threshold level and exponential above it under suitably chosen system parameters. This result is proved using the so called BAR approach studied in Braverman, Dai and Miyazawa (2017, 2023) and Miyazawa (2017, 2023). We also intuitively discuss about a diffusion process corresponding to the limit of the stationary distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study a finite horizon linear-quadratic stochastic control problem for Brownian particles, where the cost functions depend on the state and the occupation measure of the particles. To address this problem, we develop an It\^o formula for the flow of occupation measure, which enables us to derive the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Then, thanks to a Feynman-Kac formula and the Bou\'e-Dupuis formula, we construct an optimal strategy and an optimal trajectory. Finally, we illustrate our result when the cost-function is the volume of the sausage associated to the particles.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic flow out of a segment for Activated Random Walks in dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04510v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activated Random Walk is a system of interacting particles which presents a phase transition and a conjectured phenomenon of self-organized criticality. In this note, we prove that, in dimension 1, in the supercritical case, when a segment is stabilized with particles being killed when they jump out of the segment, a positive fraction of the particles leaves the segment with positive probability.
  This was already known to be a sufficient condition for being in the active phase of the model, and the result of this paper shows that this condition is also necessary, except maybe precisely at the critical point. This result can also be seen as a partial answer to some of the many conjectures which connect the different points of view on the phase transition of the model.</description>

Abstract: A semi-martingale reflecting Brownian motion is a popular process for diffusion approximations of queueing models including their networks. In this paper, we are concerned with the case that it lives on the nonnegative half-line but its variance and drift discontinuously change depending on its position. This reflecting diffusion process naturally arises from a state-dependent single server queue, studied by the author. Our main interest is in its stationary distribution, which is important for application. We define this reflecting diffusion process as the solution of a stochastic integral equation. Its existence is recently shown by Atar, Castiel and Reiman (2022,2023) under a more general condition than we have studied here, and its uniqueness is obtained also by them under one of the conditions of this paper. We here give elementary proofs for both of them. In this paper, we consider its stability, that is, the condition that the reflecting diffusion process has a stationary distribution, and derive its stationary distribution under the stability condition. Our basic tools are the generalized Ito formula for a convex function and local time. Proofs are rather elementary once it is understood how to use the Ito formula and local time.</description>

      <title>The Fourier spectrum and sumset type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the \emph{Fourier spectrum} which is a continuously parametrised family of dimensions living between the Fourier dimension and the Hausdorff dimension for both sets and measures. We establish some fundamental theory and motivate the concept via several applications, especially to sumset type problems. For example, we study dimensions of convolutions and sumsets, and solve the distance set problem for sets satisfying certain Fourier analytic conditions.</description>

      <title>Random Inverse Problems Over Graphs: Decentralized Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11789v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a framework of distributed random inverse problems over network graphs with online measurements, and propose a decentralized online learning algorithm. This unifies the distributed parameter estimation in Hilbert spaces and the least mean square problem in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS-LMS). We transform the convergence of the algorithm into the asymptotic stability of a class of inhomogeneous random difference equations in Hilbert spaces with L2-bounded martingale difference terms and develop the L2 -asymptotic stability theory in Hilbert spaces. It is shown that if the network graph is connected and the sequence of forward operators satisfies the infinite-dimensional spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition, then the estimates of all nodes are mean square and almost surely strongly consistent. Moreover, we propose a decentralized online learning algorithm in RKHS based on non-stationary and non-independent online data streams, and prove that the algorithm is mean square and almost surely strongly consistent if the operators induced by the random input data satisfy the infinite-dimensional spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>
