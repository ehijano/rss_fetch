      <title>From Fractional Differential Equations with Hilfer Derivatives: To Discrete Maps with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we proposed new discrete maps with memory (DMM). These maps are derived from fractional differential equations (FDE) with the Hilfer fractional derivatives of non-integer orders and periodic sequence of kicks. The suggested DMM are obtained from these equations without any approximation, and they are a discrete form of the exact solutions. DMM are proposed for arbitrary positive orders of equations with the Hilfer fractional derivatives. As an example, the suggested maps are described for the orders lying in the intervals (0,1) and (1,2). The maps, which are derived from the equations with the Hilfer operators, allow us to consider a whole range of the maps derived from the FDE with the Caputo and Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives.</description>

      <title>Fractional Dynamics with Non-Local Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear fractional dynamics with scale invariance in continuous and discrete time approaches are described. We use non-integer-order integro-differential operators that can be interpreted as generalizations of scaling (dilation) differential operator for the case of non-locality. Nonlinear integro-differential equations with Hadamard type operators of non-integer orders with respect to time and periodic sequence of kicks are considered. Exact solutions of these equations are derived without using approximations. Using these solutions for discrete time points, we derive mappings with non-local scaling in time from proposed equations without approximation. Non-local mappings are obtained in general for arbitrary orders of the Hadamard type fractional operators. An example of these mappings with non-local scaling in time is given for arbitrary positive orders of integro-differential equations with kicks. The proposed mappings are independent of the period of kicks at zero initial conditions. The proposed approach can be used to describe the nonlinear fractional dynamics that is characterized by scale invariance.</description>

      <title>The hot-electron closure of the moment-based gyrokinetic plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the hot-electron limit (HEL) closure of the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, denoted as gyromoment (GM). By expanding gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio Ti/Te limit and retaining only essential O(Ti/Te) terms, we obtain a closed system for density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In the Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy in Z-pinch geometry, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low-collisionality dynamics. Extension to tokamak-relevant s-alpha geometry, and comparison with gyrokinetic simulations, reveals the HEL closed GM model capabilities and limitations: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at Ti/Te=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents accurate Dimits shift prediction and transport suppression.</description>

      <title>The Role of Phase and Spatial Modes in Wave-Induced Plasma Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a two-dimensional symplectic map for particle motion at the plasma edge by modeling the electrostatic potential as a superposition of integer spatial harmonics with relative phase shift, then reduce it to a two-wave model to study the transport dependence on the perturbation amplitudes, relative phase, and spatial-mode choice. Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.</description>

      <title>Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent time-series foundation models exhibit strong abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context, without knowledge of the underlying physics. Here, we show that foundation models often forecast through a simple parroting strategy, and when they are not parroting they exhibit some shared failure modes such as converging to the mean. As a result, a naive context parroting model that copies directly from the context scores higher than leading time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, including low-dimensional chaos, turbulence, coupled oscillators, and electrocardiograms -- and at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains recent works showing that large language models can often be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the underlying chaotic attractor, providing insight into previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. By revealing the performance gaps and failure modes of current time-series foundation models, context parroting can guide the design of future foundation models and help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.</description>
