      <title>A universal description of massive point vortices in superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex mass, which is the inertia of a quantum vortex, has never been observed in superfluids and is a long-standing problem in low temperature physics. The impact of the mass is considered negligible in typical experiments with superfluid $^4$He. Recent developments of experimental techniques for manipulating quantum vortices in superfluid atomic gases have enabled us to test this problem more accurately. By introducing universal time and length scales to many-body problems of massive quantum vortices, the theoretical description is formulated in the simplest manner and is universally applicable to different quantum fluids, including fermionic and multicomponent superfluids. There are two branches, the cyclotron and massless branches, for the circular motion of a pair of like-sign vortices. The cyclotron branch can be considered stable as a clear evidence of vortex mass in fermionic superfluids such as superfluid $^3$He-B. The impact of the mass on the massless branch is small but can be enhanced by taking the difference in the two-body dynamics of point vortices with different initial conditions. Our results imply that the vortex mass is a direct cause of the splitting instability of a doubly quantized vortex at absolute zero and that the universal length scale characterizes the final state after the instability. It is also demonstrated that a pair of massive vortices with opposite circulations has a critical distance characterized by the length scale, below which they are spontaneously annihilated without thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of the Hubbard interaction in low-dimensional optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model is a paradigmatic model of strongly correlated quantum matter, thus making it desirable to investigate with quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. Here, we consider the problem of two atoms interacting in a quasi-one- or quasi-two-dimensional optical lattice, geometries which are routinely realized in quantum-gas-microscope experiments. We perform an exact calculation of the low-energy scattering amplitude which accounts for the effects of the transverse confinement as well as all higher Bloch bands. This goes beyond standard perturbative treatments and allows us to precisely determine the effective Hubbard on-site interaction for arbitrary $s$-wave scattering length (see source code available at [1]). In particular, we find that the Hubbard on-site interaction displays lattice-induced resonances for scattering lengths on the order of the lattice spacing, which are well within reach of current experiments. Furthermore, we show that our results are in excellent agreement with spectroscopic measurements of the Hubbard interaction for a quasi-two-dimensional square optical lattice in a quantum gas microscope. Our formalism is very general and may be extended to multi-band models and other atom-like scenarios in lattice geometries, such as exciton-exciton and exciton-electron scattering in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Chiral superfluidity of helium-3 in the quasi-two-dimensional limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors chiral superfluid $^3$He-A over time-reversal invariant $^3$He-B. Confining superfluid $^3$He into a cavity of height $D$ of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length $\xi_0$ -- ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar) -- extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures $P$ and temperatures $T$ where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this work the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid $^4$He film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full $P-T$ phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit $D/\xi_0 = 1$. The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully-gapped two-dimensional $p_x + ip_y$ superfluid under more extreme confinement.</description>

      <title>Universal semiclassical dynamics in disordered two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of disordered two-dimensional systems is much less understood than the dynamics of disordered chains, mainly due to the lack of appropriate numerical methods. We demonstrate that a single-trajectory version of the fermionic truncated Wigner approximation (fTWA) gives unexpectedly accurate results for the dynamics of one-dimensional (1D) systems with moderate or strong disorder. Additionally, the computational complexity of calculations carried out within this approximation is small enough to enable studies of two-dimensional (2D) systems larger than standard fTWA. Using this method, we analyze the dynamics of interacting spinless fermions propagating on disordered 1D and 2D lattices. We find for both spatial dimensions that the imbalance exhibits a universal dependence on the rescaled time $t/\xi_W$, where in 2D the time-scale $\xi_W$ follows a stretched-exponential dependence on disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Curved vortex surfaces in four-dimensional superfluids: I. Unequal-frequency double rotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of superfluid quantum vortices has long been an important area of research, with previous work naturally focusing on two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems, where rotation stabilises point vortices and line vortices respectively. Interestingly, this physics generalises for a hypothetical four-dimensional (4D) superfluid to include vortex planes, which can have a much richer phenomenology. In this paper, we study the possibility of skewed and curved vortex planes, which have no direct analogue in lower dimensions. By analytically and numerically studying the 4D Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we show that such vortex surfaces can be stabilised and favoured by double rotation with unequal rotation frequencies. Our work raises open questions for further research into the physics of these vortex surfaces and suggests interesting future extensions to tilted vortex surfaces under equal-frequency double rotation and to more realistic 4D models.</description>

      <title>Curved vortex surfaces in four-dimensional superfluids: II. Equal-frequency double rotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As is well-known, two-dimensional and three-dimensional superfluids under rotation can support topological excitations such as quantized point vortices and line vortices respectively. Recently, we have studied how, in a hypothetical four-dimensional (4D) superfluid, such excitations can be generalised to vortex planes and surfaces. In this paper, we continue our analysis of skewed and curved vortex surfaces based on the 4D Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and show that certain types of such states can be stabilised by equal-frequency double rotations for suitable parameters. This work extends the rich phenomenology of vortex surfaces in 4D, and raises interesting questions about vortex reconnections and the competition between various vortex structures which have no direct analogue in lower dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological Floquet engineering of a three-band optical lattice with dual-mode resonant driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Floquet framework for controlling topological features of a one-dimensional optical lattice system with dual-mode resonant driving, in which both the amplitude and phase of the lattice potential are modulated simultaneously. We investigate a three-band model consisting of the three lowest orbitals and elucidate the formation of a cross-linked two-leg ladder through an indirect interband coupling via an off-resonant band. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of topologically nontrivial bands within the driven system, and a topological charge pumping phenomenon with cyclic parameter changes in the dual-mode resonant driving. Finally, we show that the band topology in the driven three-band system is protected by parity-time reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in periodic Gauss-law sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the properties of a one-dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in different Gauss law sectors, corresponding to different configurations of static charges set by the orientations of the gauge spins. Importantly, in quantum simulator experiments these sectors can be accessed without adding any additional physical particles or changing the Hamiltonian: The Gauss law sectors are simply set by the initial conditions. We study the interplay between conservation laws and interactions when the static charges are chosen to form periodic patterns. We classify the different Gauss law sectors and use the density matrix renormalization group to calculate the ground state compressibility, density profiles, charge density wave order parameters, and single particle correlation functions as a function of matter density. We find confined and deconfined phases, charge density waves, correlated insulators, and supersolids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Bulk vs. Surface: Non-universal partitioning of the topological magnetoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) band insulator with time-reversal ($\Theta$) symmetry or time-reversal times a discrete translation ($\Theta T_{1/2}$) symmetry is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-valued topological invariant and characterized by quantized magnetoelectric response. Here we demonstrate by explicit calculation in model $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological insulator thin-films that whereas the magnetoelectric response is localized at the surface in the $\Theta$ symmetry (non-magnetic) case, it is non-universally partitioned between surface and interior contributions in the $\Theta T_{1/2}$ (anti-ferromagnetic) case, while remaining quantized. Within our model the magnetic field induced polarization arises entirely from an anomalous ${\cal N}=0$ Landau level subspace within which the projected Hamiltonian is a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model whose topological properties are consistent with those of the starting 3D model. We identify a novel connection between the ground state geometry of that 3D model and surface-interior-partitioning in thin films.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of some of the main quasiprobabilities that can describe the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times. Such statistics incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. We particularly focus on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and related distributions. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. We illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium nondriven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, and quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. We meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.</description>

      <title>The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a general theoretical framework, which expresses the topological invariants of two-dimensional Floquet systems in terms of tractable response functions: Building on the Sambe representation of periodically-driven systems, and inspired by the St\v{r}eda formula for static systems, we evaluate the flow of the unbounded Floquet density of states in response to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which is a priori mathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\`aro summation method. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet winding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian. These general relations indicate how the topological characterization of Floquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of the driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable contributions to the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge between the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow of energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight on the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory provides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital magnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding numbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an experimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from density-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general expressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological characterization of interacting Floquet systems.</description>
