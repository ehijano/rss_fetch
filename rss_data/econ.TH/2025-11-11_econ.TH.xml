      <title>Why `Fair Market Valuations' are Inappropirate for Employee-Owned Firms and Partnerships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual formulas for the fair market valuation of a firm at time $t$ include the profits accruing to the shares at time $t$ from the use of wage or salaried labor in the future. But in employee-owned firms or partnerships, the future worker-members or partners are the residual claimants at those future times, so in those cases, the future residuals do not accrue to the current shareholder/residual-claimants. Hence any `fair market valuation' of an employee-owned firm or partnership that assumes those future residuals accrue to the current shareholder/residual-claimants is inappropriate.
  Keywords: fair market valuations, residual claimants, property rights, personal rights, Miller-Modigliani valuations.</description>

      <title>Mapping Power Relations: A Geometric Framework for Game-Theoretic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing power relations in games, independent of their strategic form. We define a canonical preference space where each player's relational stance is a normalized vector. This model eliminates the arbitrariness of selecting utility functions, a limitation of recent approaches. We show how classical concepts-bargaining power, dependence, reciprocity-are recovered and generalized within this space. The analysis proceeds in two steps: projecting a game's payoffs and outcomes onto the space, and then reducing the resulting landscape using key metrics. These include a Center of Mass (CoM) and structural indices for Hierarchy (H) and Reciprocity (R). Applications to canonical games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Battle of the Sexes) and economic models (Cournot duopoly) demonstrate that the framework reveals underlying structural similarities across different strategic settings and provides a quantitative characterization of relational dynamics. It thus bridges cooperative and non-cooperative game theory by conceptualizing power as a structural property of the mapping from preferences to equilibria.</description>

      <title>The Future of AI in the GCC Post-NPM Landscape: A Comparative Analysis of Kuwait and the UAE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparative evidence on how Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states turn artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions into post--New Public Management (post-NPM) outcomes is scarce because most studies examine Western democracies. We analyze constitutional, collective-choice, and operational rules shaping AI uptake in two contrasting GCC members, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, and whether they foster citizen centricity, collaborative governance, and public value creation. Anchored in Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework, the study combines a most similar/most different systems design with multiple sources: 62 public documents from 2018--2025, embedded UAE cases (Smart Dubai and MBZUAI), and 39 interviews with officials conducted Aug 2024--May 2025. Dual coding and process tracing connect rule configurations to AI performance. Cross-case analysis identifies four reinforcing mechanisms behind divergent trajectories. In the UAE, concentrated authority, credible sanctions, pro-innovation narratives, and flexible reinvestment rules scale pilots into hundreds of services and sizable recycled savings. In Kuwait, dispersed veto points, exhortative sanctions, cautious discourse, and lapsed AI budgets confine initiatives to pilot mode despite equivalent fiscal resources. The findings refine institutional theory by showing that vertical rule coherence, not wealth, determines AI's public-value yield, and temper post-NPM optimism by revealing that efficiency metrics serve societal goals only when backed by enforceable safeguards. To curb ethics washing and test transferability beyond the GCC, future work should track rule diffusion over time, develop blended legitimacy--efficiency scorecards, and examine how narrative framing shapes citizen consent for data sharing.</description>

      <title>Non-Market Allocation Mechanisms: Optimal Design and Investment Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how to optimally design selection mechanisms, accounting for agents' investment incentives. A principal wishes to allocate a resource of homogeneous quality to a heterogeneous population of agents. The principal commits to a possibly random selection rule that depends on a one-dimensional characteristic of the agents she intrinsically values. Agents have a strict preference for being selected by the principal and may undertake a costly investment to improve their characteristic before it is revealed to the principal. We show that even if random selection rules foster agents' investments, especially at the top of the characteristic distribution, deterministic "pass-fail" selection rules are in fact optimal.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Value of Monitoring Structures in Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09211v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies how improved monitoring affects the limit equilibrium payoff set for stochastic games with imperfect public monitoring. We introduce a simple generalization of Blackwell garbling called weighted garbling in order to compare different monitoring structures for this class of games. Our main result is the monotonicity of the limit perfect public equilibrium (PPE) payoff set with respect to this information order. We show that the limit PPE payoff set expands when the monitoring structure gets more informative with respect to the weighted garbling order. We also show that a similar monotonicity holds for strongly symmetric equilibrium for symmetric stochastic games. Finally, we show that our weighted garbling order is useful to compare the limit PPE payoff set for different state transition laws and monitoring structures when the limit feasible payoff set is the same.</description>

      <title>Truth, Lies, and Social Ties: When Image Concerns Fuel Fake News</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how social image concerns shape information sharing among peers. Individuals receive a signal about a binary state of the world characterized by both a direction and a veracity status. While the direction is freely observable, verifying veracity is costly and depends on individual type. We consider two distinct social image motives: a desire to appear competent and a desire to signal one's worldview. For each motive, we characterize equilibrium sharing behavior and derive implications for the quality of shared information. We identify conditions under which false news is shared more frequently than factual news (e.g., Vosoughi et al., 2018). Both competence- and worldview-based motives can rationalize such patterns, though they yield empirically distinct sharing behaviors and different welfare implications. Finally, we derive testable predictions for each motive and discuss how these align with existing empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>Motivated Reasoning and the Political Economy of Climate Change Inaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two office-driven politicians compete in an election by proposing policies. There are two possible states of the world: climate change is either mild, with no lasting effect on welfare if addressed properly, or severe, leading to reduced welfare even with appropriate measures. Voters receive signals about the state but may interpret them in a non-Bayesian way, holding motivated beliefs. An equilibrium always exists where voters ignore signals suggesting severe consequences, causing politicians to propose policies for mild climate change--even when they know otherwise. If severe climate change leads to only moderate welfare losses, an efficient equilibrium also exists. In this equilibrium, voters trust politicians to choose the optimal policies, implying voters choose to trust their signals, which in turn encourages optimal policy choices by politicians. The model highlights the role of political rhetoric and trust in government, and a first glance at the data reveals patterns consistent with the models predictions.</description>

      <title>Choquet rank-dependent utility with an exogenous unambiguous source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We axiomatize the Choquet rank-dependent utility model within a Savage framework with an exogenous source of pure risk. This model is a decision model under ambiguity, serving as a conceptual generalization of the Choquet expected utility model. The model unifies risk and ambiguity and reduces to the rank-dependent utility for pure risks. Our axiomatization uses two main axioms for biseparable preferences, along with some regularity axioms. A benefit of this axiomatization is that the fairly weak regularity axioms guarantee the existence of matching probabilities. Further, we discuss ambiguity attitudes for the CRDU model. We characterize these attitudes by properties of the associated matching probabilities and show that the supermodularity of the matching probability provides a robust representation. Finally, we show that under an additional Property, this model has a different representation using act-dependent distortion functions.</description>

      <title>Inequality in the Age of Pseudonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04668v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings that are common in the digital age. One key challenge of such environments is the ability of actors to create fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently hamper inequality measurements. As we prove, it is impossible for measures satisfying the literature's canonical set of desired properties to assess the inequality of an economy that may harbor Sybils. We characterize the class of all Sybil-proof measures, and prove that they must satisfy relaxed version of the aforementioned properties. Furthermore, we show that the structure imposed restricts the ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. By applying our results, we prove that large classes of popular measures are not Sybil-proof, with the famous Gini coefficient being but one example out of many. Finally, we examine the dynamics leading to the creation of Sybils in digital and traditional settings.</description>

      <title>Matchings Under Biased and Correlated Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-institution stable matching model in which candidates from two distinct groups are evaluated using partially correlated signals that are group-biased. This extends prior work (which assumes institutions evaluate candidates in an identical manner) to a more realistic setting in which institutions rely on overlapping, but independently processed, criteria. These evaluations could consist of a variety of informative tools such as standardized tests, shared recommendation systems, or AI-based assessments with local noise. Two key parameters govern evaluations: the bias parameter $\beta \in (0,1]$, which models systematic disadvantage faced by one group, and the correlation parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$, which captures the alignment between institutional rankings. We study the representation ratio, i.e., the ratio of disadvantaged to advantaged candidates selected by the matching process in this setting. Focusing on a regime in which all candidates prefer the same institution, we characterize the large-market equilibrium and derive a closed-form expression for the resulting representation ratio. Prior work shows that when $\gamma = 1$, this ratio scales linearly with $\beta$. In contrast, we show that the representation ratio increases nonlinearly with $\gamma$ and even modest losses in correlation can cause sharp drops in the representation ratio. Our analysis identifies critical $\gamma$-thresholds where institutional selection behavior undergoes discrete transitions, and reveals structural conditions under which evaluator alignment or bias mitigation are most effective. Finally, we show how this framework and results enable interventions for fairness-aware design in decentralized selection systems.</description>
