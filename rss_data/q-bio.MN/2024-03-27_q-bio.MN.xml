      <title>Collaborative graphical lasso</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the availability of multi-omics data has increased substantially. Multi-omics data integration methods mainly aim to leverage different molecular data sets to gain a complete molecular description of biological processes. An attractive integration approach is the reconstruction of multi-omics networks. However, the development of effective multi-omics network reconstruction strategies lags behind. This hinders maximizing the potential of multi-omics data sets. With this study, we advance the frontier of multi-omics network reconstruction by introducing "collaborative graphical lasso" as a novel strategy. Our proposed algorithm synergizes "graphical lasso" with the concept of "collaboration", effectively harmonizing multi-omics data sets integration, thereby enhancing the accuracy of network inference. Besides, to tackle model selection in this framework, we designed an ad hoc procedure based on network stability. We assess the performance of collaborative graphical lasso and the corresponding model selection procedure through simulations, and we apply them to publicly available multi-omics data. This demonstrated collaborative graphical lasso is able to reconstruct known biological connections and suggest previously unknown and biologically coherent interactions, enabling the generation of novel hypotheses. We implemented collaborative graphical lasso as an R package, available on CRAN as coglasso.</description>

      <title>FluxGAT: Integrating Flux Sampling with Graph Neural Networks for Unbiased Gene Essentiality Classification</title>

Abstract: Gene essentiality, the necessity of a specific gene for the survival of an organism, is crucial to our understanding of cellular processes and identifying drug targets. Experimental determination of gene essentiality requires large growth screens that are time-consuming and expensive, motivating the development of in-silico approaches. Existing methods predominantly utilise flux balance analysis (FBA), a constraint-based optimisation algorithm; however, they are fundamentally limited by the necessity of a predefined cellular objective function. This requirement introduces an element of observer bias, as the objective function often reflects the researcher's assumptions rather than the cell's biological goals. Here, we present FluxGAT, a graph neural network (GNN) model capable of predicting gene essentiality directly from graphical representations of flux sampling data. Flux sampling removes the need for objective functions, thereby eliminating observer bias. FluxGAT leverages the unique strengths of GNNs in learning representations of complex relationships within metabolic reaction networks. The success of our approach in predicting experimentally determined gene essentiality, with almost double the sensitivity of FBA, explores the possibility of predicting cellular phenotypes in cases when objectives are less understood. Thus, we demonstrate a method for more general gene essentiality predictions across a broader spectrum of biological systems and environments.</description>
