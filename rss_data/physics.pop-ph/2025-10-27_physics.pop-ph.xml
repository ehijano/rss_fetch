      <title>Propellantless space exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propellantless propulsion refers to methods of space travel that do not require onboard propellant, instead relying on natural forces or external energy sources. In this paper, I review different approaches that have been explored and discuss the pros and cons of each method for interstellar space exploration.
  Gravitational assist uses planetary gravity to change a spacecraft's speed and direction without fuel. It is effective but limited to specific alignments.
  Solar sails harness radiation pressure from sunlight for continuous, fuel-free acceleration. While effective over time, they require large, reflective materials that degrade in space. Speed can be enhanced by thermal desorption triggered by solar radiation.
  Magnetic sails generate thrust by interacting with the solar wind through superconducting loops that produce a magnetic field. They provide lower acceleration compared to solar sails, and their performance depends on the available power and the variability of solar wind conditions.
  Electric sails utilize charged tethers to repel solar wind protons, producing gradual acceleration. Their effectiveness depends on the successful deployment of very long, lightweight conductive wires. They can achieve higher acceleration than solar sails, and their performance is influenced by available power and solar wind conditions.
  Lastly, quantum effects, such as the Casimir force, offer a speculative but intriguing route to propellantless propulsion based on the vacuum energy of space.</description>

      <title>The origin of the dark bands found in the Solar Spectra and its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the history of Fraunhofer's puzzling discovery of the fixed lines in various spectra (most notably of the sun) and the implications of these spectral "imperfections". Moreover, the developments in spectroscopy by Kirchhoff, Bunsen, et al. in the 19th century and its effects on our understanding of the atomic structure are discussed.</description>

      <title>Wind Power as a Technosignature on M-dwarf Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest that the large-scale deployment of wind turbines on an M-dwarf planet could produce observable technosignatures. Motivated by observations of hypersonic wind velocities on WASP-127 b, we note that the atmospheres of such planets could serve as vast reservoirs of energy for an extraterrestrial civilization. A large-scale deployment of wind turbines in a hypersonic environment would produce heated shock waves in the hypersonic stream, cause strong frictional heating from the rotation of the blades, and be a source of infrared radiation. We mention possible scenarios that could lead to the deployment of wind turbines on a gas giant and also note that similar features could exist on terrestrial M-dwarf planets. The idea that aerodynamic peculiarities could be a technosignature is worth keeping in mind as ground- and space-based exoplanet observations continue to improve.</description>

      <title>Hawking in a thousand words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: British physicist Stephen Hawkings most important discovery was that black holes are not so black, as they possess a temperature and emit thermal radiation. In his popular science texts, Hawking offered a detailed explanation of this phenomenon. The aim of this work is to translate that explanation into mathematical language accessible to an advanced high school student, all within a thousand words.</description>
