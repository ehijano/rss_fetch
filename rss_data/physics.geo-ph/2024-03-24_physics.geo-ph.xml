      <title>End-to-End Mineral Exploration with Artificial Intelligence and Ambient Noise Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative end-to-end workflow for mineral exploration, integrating ambient noise tomography (ANT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the discovery and delineation of mineral resources essential for the global transition to a low carbon economy. We focus on copper as a critical element, required in significant quantities for renewable energy solutions. We show the benefits of utilising ANT, characterised by its speed, scalability, depth penetration, resolution, and low environmental impact, alongside artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to refine a continent-scale prospectivity model at the deposit scale by fine-tuning our model on local high-resolution data. We show the promise of the method by first presenting a new data-driven AI prospectivity model for copper within Australia, which serves as our foundation model for further fine-tuning. We then focus on the Hillside IOCG deposit on the prospective Yorke Peninsula. We show that with relatively few local training samples (orebody intercepts), we can fine tune the foundation model to provide a good estimate of the Hillside orebody outline. Our methodology demonstrates how AI can augment geophysical data interpretation, providing a novel approach to mineral exploration with improved decision-making capabilities for targeting mineralization, thereby addressing the urgent need for increased mineral resource discovery.</description>

      <title>Rapid hydrofracture of icy moon shells: insights from glaciology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Europa's surface features many regions of complex topography termed 'chaos terrains'. One set of hypotheses for chaos terrain formation requires upward migration of liquid water from perched water bodies within the icy shell formed by convection and tidal heating. However, consideration of the behaviour of terrestrial ice sheets suggests the upwards movement of water from perched water bodies is uncommon. Instead, rapid downwards hydrofracture - unbounded given a sufficient supply of water - can occur in relatively low tensile stress states given a sufficiently deep initial fracture due to the negative relative buoyancy of water. I suggest that downwards, not upwards, fracture may be more reasonable for perched water bodies but show that full hydrofracture is unlikely if the perched water body is located beneath a mechanically strong icy lid. However, full hydrofracture is possible in the event of lid collapse over a perched water body and likely in the event of a meteor impact that generates sufficient meltwater and a tensile shock. This provides a possible mechanism for the transfer of biologically important nutrients to the subsurface ocean and the formation of chaos terrains.</description>
