      <title>DiffAU: Diffusion-Based Ambisonics Upscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial audio enhances immersion by reproducing 3D sound fields, with Ambisonics offering a scalable format for this purpose. While first-order Ambisonics (FOA) notably facilitates hardware-efficient acquisition and storage of sound fields as compared to high-order Ambisonics (HOA), its low spatial resolution limits realism, highlighting the need for Ambisonics upscaling (AU) as an approach for increasing the order of Ambisonics signals. In this work we propose DiffAU, a cascaded AU method that leverages recent developments in diffusion models combined with novel adaptation to spatial audio to generate 3rd order Ambisonics from FOA. By learning data distributions, DiffAU provides a principled approach that rapidly and reliably reproduces HOA in various settings. Experiments in anechoic conditions with multiple speakers, show strong objective and perceptual performance.</description>

      <title>Descriptor:: Extended-Length Audio Dataset for Synthetic Voice Detection and Speaker Recognition (ELAD-SVDSR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Extended Length Audio Dataset for Synthetic Voice Detection and Speaker Recognition (ELAD SVDSR), a resource specifically designed to facilitate the creation of high quality deepfakes and support the development of detection systems trained against them. The dataset comprises 45 minute audio recordings from 36 participants, each reading various newspaper articles recorded under controlled conditions and captured via five microphones of differing quality. By focusing on extended duration audio, ELAD SVDSR captures a richer range of speech attributes such as pitch contours, intonation patterns, and nuanced delivery enabling models to generate more realistic and coherent synthetic voices. In turn, this approach allows for the creation of robust deepfakes that can serve as challenging examples in datasets used to train and evaluate synthetic voice detection methods. As part of this effort, 20 deepfake voices have already been created and added to the dataset to showcase its potential. Anonymized metadata accompanies the dataset on speaker demographics. ELAD SVDSR is expected to spur significant advancements in audio forensics, biometric security, and voice authentication systems.</description>

      <title>Room Impulse Response Synthesis via Differentiable Feedback Delay Networks for Efficient Spatial Audio Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient and tunable feedback delay network (FDN) architecture for real-time room impulse response (RIR) rendering that addresses the computational and latency challenges inherent in traditional convolution and Fourier transform based methods. Our approach directly optimizes FDN parameters to match target RIR acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics such as clarity and definition through novel differentiable programming-based optimization. Our method enables dynamic, real-time adjustments of room impulse responses that accommodates listener and source movement. When combined with previous work on representation of head-related impulse responses via infinite impulse responses, an efficient rendering of auditory objects is possible when the HRIR and RIR are known. Our method produces renderings with quality similar to convolution with long binaural room impulse response (BRIR) filters, but at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Subjective quality evaluation of personalized own voice reconstruction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Own voice pickup technology for hearable devices facilitates communication in noisy environments. Own voice reconstruction (OVR) systems enhance the quality and intelligibility of the recorded noisy own voice signals. Since disturbances affecting the recorded own voice signals depend on individual factors, personalized OVR systems have the potential to outperform generic OVR systems. In this paper, we propose personalizing OVR systems through data augmentation and fine-tuning, comparing them to their generic counterparts. We investigate the influence of personalization on speech quality assessed by objective metrics and conduct a subjective listening test to evaluate quality under various conditions. In addition, we assess the prediction accuracy of the objective metrics by comparing predicted quality with subjectively measured quality. Our findings suggest that personalized OVR provides benefits over generic OVR for some talkers only. Our results also indicate that performance comparisons between systems are not always accurately predicted by objective metrics. In particular, certain disturbances lead to a consistent overestimation of quality compared to actual subjective ratings.</description>

      <title>Post-Training Quantization for Audio Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) enable high-quality audio synthesis but are often computationally intensive and require substantial storage, which limits their practical deployment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques for audio DiTs, analyzing the trade-offs between static and dynamic quantization schemes. We explore two practical extensions (1) a denoising-timestep-aware smoothing method that adapts quantization scales per-input-channel and timestep to mitigate activation outliers, and (2) a lightweight low-rank adapter (LoRA)-based branch derived from singular value decomposition (SVD) to compensate for residual weight errors. Using Stable Audio Open we benchmark W8A8 and W4A8 configurations across objective metrics and human perceptual ratings. Our results show that dynamic quantization preserves fidelity even at lower precision, while static methods remain competitive with lower latency. Overall, our findings show that low-precision DiTs can retain high-fidelity generation while reducing memory usage by up to 79%.</description>

      <title>Learning Domain-Robust Bioacoustic Representations for Mosquito Species Classification with Contrastive Learning and Distribution Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mosquito Species Classification (MSC) is crucial for vector surveillance and disease control. The collection of mosquito bioacoustic data is often limited by mosquito activity seasons and fieldwork. Mosquito recordings across regions, habitats, and laboratories often show non-biological variations from the recording environment, which we refer to as domain features. This study finds that models directly trained on audio recordings with domain features tend to rely on domain information rather than the species' acoustic cues for identification, resulting in illusory good performance while actually performing poor cross-domain generalization. To this end, we propose a Domain-Robust Bioacoustic Learning (DR-BioL) framework that combines contrastive learning with distribution alignment. Contrastive learning aims to promote cohesion within the same species and mitigate inter-domain discrepancies, and species-conditional distribution alignment further enhances cross-domain species representation. Experiments on a multi-domain mosquito bioacoustic dataset from diverse environments show that the DR-BioL improves the accuracy and robustness of baselines, highlighting its potential for reliable cross-domain MSC in the real world.</description>

      <title>UniverSR: Unified and Versatile Audio Super-Resolution via Vocoder-Free Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vocoder-free framework for audio super-resolution that employs a flow matching generative model to capture the conditional distribution of complex-valued spectral coefficients. Unlike conventional two-stage diffusion-based approaches that predict a mel-spectrogram and then rely on a pre-trained neural vocoder to synthesize waveforms, our method directly reconstructs waveforms via the inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform (iSTFT), thereby eliminating the dependence on a separate vocoder. This design not only simplifies end-to-end optimization but also overcomes a critical bottleneck of two-stage pipelines, where the final audio quality is fundamentally constrained by vocoder performance. Experiments show that our model consistently produces high-fidelity 48 kHz audio across diverse upsampling factors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both speech and general audio datasets.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Complete Vocal Tract Contour Through Acoustic to Articulatory Inversion Using Real-Time MRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic to articulatory inversion has often been limited to a small part of the vocal tract because the data are generally EMA (ElectroMagnetic Articulography) data requiring sensors to be glued to easily accessible articulators. The presented acoustic to articulation model focuses on the inversion of the entire vocal tract from the glottis, the complete tongue, the velum, to the lips. It relies on a realtime dynamic MRI database of more than 3 hours of speech. The data are the denoised speech signal and the automatically segmented articulator contours. Several bidirectional LSTM-based approaches have been used, either inverting each articulator individually or inverting all articulators simultaneously. To our knowledge, this is the first complete inversion of the vocal tract. The average RMSE precision on the test set is 1.65 mm to be compared with the pixel size which is 1.62 mm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CL-UZH team submitted one system each for the fixed and open conditions of the NIST SRE 2024 challenge. For the closed-set condition, results for the audio-only trials were achieved using the X-vector system developed with Kaldi. For the audio-visual results we used only models developed for the visual modality. Two sets of results were submitted for the open-set and closed-set conditions, one based on a pretrained model using the VoxBlink2 and VoxCeleb2 datasets. An Xvector-based model was trained from scratch using the CTS superset dataset for the closed set. In addition to the submission of the results of the SRE24 evaluation to the competition website, we talked about the performance of the proposed systems on the SRE24 evaluation in this report.</description>

      <title>Spiralformer: Low Latency Encoder for Streaming Speech Recognition with Circular Layer Skipping and Early Exiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For streaming speech recognition, a Transformer-based encoder has been widely used with block processing. Although many studies addressed improving emission latency of transducers, little work has been explored for improving encoding latency of the block processing. We seek to reduce latency by frequently emitting a chunk with a small shift rather than scarce large-chunk emissions, resulting in higher computational costs. To efficiently compute with the small chunk shift, we propose a new encoder, Spiralformer, tailored for block processing by combining layer dropping and early exiting. We skip layer computation in a cyclic manner and shift the computed layer in each block spirally, which completes computation for all the layers over the block processing. Experimentally, we observed that our method achieved 21.6% reduction in the averaged token emission delay in Librispeech, and 7.0% in CSJ, compared with the baseline with similar computational cost and word error rates.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Graph Frequency Representation for Monaural Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01130v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) has recently demonstrated promising results in speech enhancement. However, existing GFT-based speech enhancement approaches often employ fixed graph topologies to build the graph Fourier basis, whose the representation lacks the adaptively and flexibility. In addition, they suffer from the numerical errors and instability introduced by matrix inversion in GFT based on both Singular Value Decomposition (GFT-SVD) and Eigen Vector Decomposition (GFT-EVD). Motivated by these limitations, this paper propose a simple yet effective learnable GFT-SVD framework for speech enhancement. Specifically, we leverage graph shift operators to construct a learnable graph topology and define a learnable graph Fourier basis by the singular value matrices using 1-D convolution (Conv-1D) neural layer. This eliminates the need for matrix inversion, thereby avoiding the associated numerical errors and stability problem.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Musical Symbolism in Online Communities: Content-Based and Network-Centric Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how musical symbolism is produced and circulated in online communities by combining content-based music analysis with a lightweight network perspective on lyrics. Using a curated corpus of 275 chart-topping songs enriched with audio descriptors (energy, danceability, loudness, liveness, valence, acousticness, speechiness, popularity) and full lyric transcripts, we build a reproducible pipeline that (i) quantifies temporal trends in sonic attributes, (ii) models lexical salience and co-occurrence, and (iii) profiles mood by genre. We find a decade-long decline in energy (79 -&gt; 58) alongside a rise in danceability (59 -&gt; 73); valence peaks in 2013 (63) and dips in 2014-2016 (42) before partially recovering. Correlation analysis shows strong coupling of energy with loudness (r = 0.74) and negative associations for acousticness with both energy (r = -0.54) and loudness (r = -0.51); danceability is largely orthogonal to other features (|r| &lt; 0.20). Lyric tokenization (&gt;114k tokens) reveals a pronoun-centric lexicon "I/you/me/my" and a dense co-occurrence structure in which interpersonal address anchors mainstream narratives. Mood differs systematically by style: R&amp;B exhibits the highest mean valence (96), followed by K-Pop/Pop (77) and Indie/Pop (70), whereas Latin/Reggaeton is lower (37) despite high danceability. Read through a subcultural identity lens, these patterns suggest the mainstreaming of previously peripheral codes and a commercial preference for relaxed yet rhythmically engaging productions that sustain collective participation without maximal intensity. Methodologically, we contribute an integrated MIR-plus-network workflow spanning summary statistics, correlation structure, lexical co-occurrence matrices, and genre-wise mood profiling that is robust to modality sparsity and suitable for socially aware recommendation or community-level diffusion studies.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Aware Iterative Speech Model for Dementia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning systems often struggle with processing long sequences, where computational complexity can become a bottleneck. Current methods for automated dementia detection using speech frequently rely on static, time-agnostic features or aggregated linguistic content, lacking the flexibility to model the subtle, progressive deterioration inherent in speech production. These approaches often miss the dynamic temporal patterns that are critical early indicators of cognitive decline. In this paper, we introduce TAI-Speech, a Temporal Aware Iterative framework that dynamically models spontaneous speech for dementia detection. The flexibility of our method is demonstrated through two key innovations: 1) Optical Flow-inspired Iterative Refinement: By treating spectrograms as sequential frames, this component uses a convolutional GRU to capture the fine-grained, frame-to-frame evolution of acoustic features. 2) Cross-Attention Based Prosodic Alignment: This component dynamically aligns spectral features with prosodic patterns, such as pitch and pauses, to create a richer representation of speech production deficits linked to functional decline (IADL). TAI-Speech adaptively models the temporal evolution of each utterance, enhancing the detection of cognitive markers. Experimental results on the DementiaBank dataset show that TAI-Speech achieves a strong AUC of 0.839 and 80.6\% accuracy, outperforming text-based baselines without relying on ASR. Our work provides a more flexible and robust solution for automated cognitive assessment, operating directly on the dynamics of raw audio.</description>

      <title>Object-AVEdit: An Object-level Audio-Visual Editing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a high demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and the film making field. While numerous models have explored audio and video editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically, object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities, while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved advanced performance. More results on our project page: https://gewu-lab.github.io/Object_AVEdit-website/.</description>

Abstract: Sleep apnea is a serious sleep-related breathing disorder that is common and can impact health if left untreated. Currently the traditional method for screening and diagnosis is overnight polysomnography. Polysomnography is expensive and takes a lot of time, and is not practical for screening large groups of people. In this paper, we explored a more accessible option, using respiratory audio recordings to spot signs of apnea.We utilized 18 audio files.The approach involved converting breathing sounds into spectrograms, balancing the dataset by oversampling apnea segments, and applying class weights to reduce bias toward the majority class. The model reached a recall of 90.55 for apnea detection. Intentionally, prioritizing catching apnea events over general accuracy. Despite low precision,the high recall suggests potential as a low-cost screening tool that could be used at home or in basic clinical setups, potentially helping identify at-risk individuals much earlier.</description>

      <title>Dereverberation Using Binary Residual Masking with Time-Domain Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vocal dereverberation remains a challenging task in audio processing, particularly for real-time applications where both accuracy and efficiency are crucial. Traditional deep learning approaches often struggle to suppress reverberation without degrading vocal clarity, while recent methods that jointly predict magnitude and phase have significant computational cost. We propose a real-time dereverberation framework based on residual mask prediction in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. A U-Net architecture is trained to estimate a residual reverberation mask that suppresses late reflections while preserving direct speech components. A hybrid objective combining binary cross-entropy, residual magnitude reconstruction, and time-domain consistency further encourages both accurate suppression and perceptual quality. Together, these components enable low-latency dereverberation suitable for real-world speech and singing applications.</description>

      <title>SAGE-Music: Low-Latency Symbolic Music Generation via Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency symbolic music generation is essential for real-time improvisation and human-AI co-creation. Existing transformer-based models, however, face a trade-off between inference speed and musical quality. Traditional acceleration techniques such as embedding pooling significantly degrade quality, while recently proposed Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) methods - though effective on single-track piano data - suffer large performance drops in multi-track settings, as revealed by our analysis. We propose Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing (AS-KVHS), adapted to music's structured symbolic representation, achieving about 30% inference speedup with only a negligible (about 0.4%) quality drop in objective evaluations and slight improvements in subjective listening tests. Our main contributions are (1) the first systematic study of BPE's generalizability in multi-track symbolic music, and (2) the introduction of AS-KVHS for low-latency symbolic music generation. Beyond these, we also release SAGE-Music, an open-source benchmark that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models in generation quality.</description>

      <title>PodEval: A Multimodal Evaluation Framework for Podcast Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, an increasing number of multimodal (text and audio) benchmarks have emerged, primarily focusing on evaluating models' understanding capability. However, exploration into assessing generative capabilities remains limited, especially for open-ended long-form content generation. Significant challenges lie in no reference standard answer, no unified evaluation metrics and uncontrollable human judgments. In this work, we take podcast-like audio generation as a starting point and propose PodEval, a comprehensive and well-designed open-source evaluation framework. In this framework: 1) We construct a real-world podcast dataset spanning diverse topics, serving as a reference for human-level creative quality. 2) We introduce a multimodal evaluation strategy and decompose the complex task into three dimensions: text, speech and audio, with different evaluation emphasis on "Content" and "Format". 3) For each modality, we design corresponding evaluation methods, involving both objective metrics and subjective listening test. We leverage representative podcast generation systems (including open-source, close-source, and human-made) in our experiments. The results offer in-depth analysis and insights into podcast generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of PodEval in evaluating open-ended long-form audio. This project is open-source to facilitate public use: https://github.com/yujxx/PodEval.</description>

      <title>From Scores to Preferences: Redefining MOS Benchmarking for Speech Quality Reward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing the perceptual quality of synthetic speech is crucial for guiding the development and refinement of speech generation models. However, it has traditionally relied on human subjective ratings such as the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), which depend on manual annotations and often suffer from inconsistent rating standards and poor reproducibility. To address these limitations, we introduce MOS-RMBench, a unified benchmark that reformulates diverse MOS datasets into a preference-comparison setting, enabling rigorous evaluation across different datasets. Building on MOS-RMBench, we systematically construct and evaluate three paradigms for reward modeling: scalar reward models, semi-scalar reward models, and generative reward models (GRMs). Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) scalar models achieve the strongest overall performance, consistently exceeding 74% accuracy; (2) most models perform considerably worse on synthetic speech than on human speech; and (3) all models struggle on pairs with very small MOS differences. To improve performance on these challenging pairs, we propose a MOS-aware GRM that incorporates an MOS-difference-based reward function, enabling the model to adaptively scale rewards according to the difficulty of each sample pair. Experimental results show that the MOS-aware GRM significantly improves fine-grained quality discrimination and narrows the gap with scalar models on the most challenging cases. We hope this work will establish both a benchmark and a methodological framework to foster more rigorous and scalable research in automatic speech quality assessment.</description>

      <title>A Robust Proactive Communication Strategy for Distributed Active Noise Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) systems assign the high computational load of conventional centralized algorithms across multiple processing nodes, leveraging inter-node communication to collaboratively suppress unwanted noise. However, communication overhead can undermine algorithmic stability and degrade overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a robust communication framework that integrates adaptive-fixed-filter switching and the mixed-gradient combination strategy. In this approach, each node independently executes a single-channel filtered reference least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm while monitoring real-time noise reduction levels. When the current noise reduction performance degrades compared to the previous state, the node halts its adaptive algorithm, switches to a fixed filter, and simultaneously initiates a communication request. The exchanged information comprises the difference between the current control filter and the filter at the time of the last communication, equivalent to the accumulated gradient sum during non-communication intervals. Upon receiving neighboring cumulative gradients, the node employs a mixed-gradient combination method to update its control filter, subsequently reverting to the adaptive mode. This proactive communication strategy and adaptive-fixed switching mechanism ensure system robustness by mitigating instability risks caused by communication issues. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves noise reduction performance comparable to centralized algorithms while maintaining stability under communication constraints, highlighting its practical applicability in real-world distributed ANC scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Holistic Evaluation of Large Audio-Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>DeepASA: An Object-Oriented One-for-All Network for Auditory Scene Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose DeepASA, a multi-purpose model for auditory scene analysis that performs multi-input multi-output (MIMO) source separation, dereverberation, sound event detection (SED), audio classification, and direction-of-arrival estimation (DoAE) within a unified framework. DeepASA is designed for complex auditory scenes where multiple, often similar, sound sources overlap in time and move dynamically in space. To achieve robust and consistent inference across tasks, we introduce an object-oriented processing (OOP) strategy. This approach encapsulates diverse auditory features into object-centric representations and refines them through a chain-of-inference (CoI) mechanism. The pipeline comprises a dynamic temporal kernel-based feature extractor, a transformer-based aggregator, and an object separator that yields per-object features. These features feed into multiple task-specific decoders. Our object-centric representations naturally resolve the parameter association ambiguity inherent in traditional track-wise processing. However, early-stage object separation can lead to failure in downstream ASA tasks. To address this, we implement temporal coherence matching (TCM) within the chain-of-inference, enabling multi-task fusion and iterative refinement of object features using estimated auditory parameters. We evaluate DeepASA on representative spatial audio benchmark datasets, including ASA2, MC-FUSS, and STARSS23. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both source separation and auditory parameter estimation under diverse spatial auditory scenes.</description>

      <title>DualCodec: A Low-Frame-Rate, Semantically-Enhanced Neural Audio Codec for Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs form the foundational building blocks for language model (LM)-based speech generation. Typically, there is a trade-off between frame rate and audio quality. This study introduces a low-frame-rate, semantically enhanced codec model. Existing approaches distill semantically rich self-supervised (SSL) representations into the first-layer codec tokens. This work proposes DualCodec, a dual-stream encoding approach that integrates SSL and waveform representations within an end-to-end codec framework. In this setting, DualCodec enhances the semantic information in the first-layer codec and enables the codec system to maintain high audio quality while operating at a low frame rate. Note that a low-frame-rate codec improves the efficiency of speech generation. Experimental results on audio codec and speech generation tasks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DualCodec compared to state-of-the-art codec systems, such as Mimi Codec, SpeechTokenizer, DAC, and Encodec.

      <title>Nonlinear Framework for Speech Bandwidth Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering high-frequency components lost to bandwidth constraints is crucial for applications ranging from telecommunications to high-fidelity audio on limited resources. We introduce NDSI-BWE, a new adversarial Band Width Extension (BWE) framework that leverage four new discriminators inspired by nonlinear dynamical system to capture diverse temporal behaviors: a Multi-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD) for determining sensitivity to initial conditions by capturing deterministic chaos, a Multi-Scale Recurrence Discriminator (MS-RD) for self-similar recurrence dynamics, a Multi-Scale Detrended Fractal Analysis Discriminator (MSDFA) for long range slow variant scale invariant relationship, a Multi-Resolution Poincar\'e Plot Discriminator (MR-PPD) for capturing hidden latent space relationship, a Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) for cyclical patterns, a Multi-Resolution Amplitude Discriminator (MRAD) and Multi-Resolution Phase Discriminator (MRPD) for capturing intricate amplitude-phase transition statistics. By using depth-wise convolution at the core of the convolutional block with in each discriminators, NDSI-BWE attains an eight-times parameter reduction. These seven discriminators guide a complex-valued ConformerNeXt based genetor with a dual stream Lattice-Net based architecture for simultaneous refinement of magnitude and phase. The genertor leverage the transformer based conformer's global dependency modeling and ConvNeXt block's local temporal modeling capability. Across six objective evaluation metrics and subjective based texts comprises of five human judges, NDSI-BWE establishes a new SoTA in BWE.</description>

      <title>A dataset and model for recognition of audiologically relevant environments for hearing aids: AHEAD-DS and YAMNet+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scene recognition of audiologically relevant environments is important for hearing aids; however, it is challenging, in part because of the limitations of existing datasets. Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or audiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine learning models. Deploying these models on resource-constrained edge devices presents another challenge. Our solution is two-fold: we leverage several open source datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for scene recognition of audiologically relevant environments, and introduce YAMNet+, a sound recognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available dataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model comparison. YAMNet+ is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with hearing aid functionality; serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene recognition. YAMNet+ achieved a mean average precision of 0.83 and accuracy of 0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories of audiologically relevant environments. We found that applying transfer learning from the pretrained YAMNet model was essential. We demonstrated real-time sound-based scene recognition capabilities on edge devices by deploying YAMNet+ to an Android smartphone. Even with a Google Pixel 3 (a phone with modest specifications, released in 2018), the model processes audio with approximately 50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms per 1 second of audio.

      <title>Deep Learning for Tuberculosis Screening in a High-burden Setting using Cough Analysis and Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can detect disease-related acoustic patterns in cough sounds, offering a scalable and cost-effective approach to tuberculosis (TB) screening in high-burden, resource-limited settings. Previous studies have been limited by small datasets, under-representation of symptomatic non-TB patients, and recordings collected in controlled environments. In this study, we enrolled 512 participants at two hospitals in Zambia, categorised into three groups: bacteriologically confirmed TB (TB+), symptomatic patients with other respiratory diseases (OR), and healthy controls (HC). Usable cough recordings with demographic and clinical data were obtained from 500 participants. Deep learning classifiers based on pre-trained speech foundation models were fine-tuned on cough recordings to predict diagnostic categories. The best-performing model, trained on 3-second audio clips, achieved an AUROC of 85.2% for distinguishing TB coughs from all other participants (TB+/Rest) and 80.1% for TB+ versus symptomatic OR participants (TB+/OR). Incorporating demographic and clinical features improved performance to 92.1% for TB+/Rest and 84.2% for TB+/OR. At a probability threshold of 0.38, the multimodal model reached 90.3% sensitivity and 73.1% specificity for TB+/Rest, meeting WHO target product profile benchmarks for TB screening. Adversarial testing and stratified analyses shows that the model was robust to confounding factors including background noise, recording time, and device variability. These results demonstrate the feasibility of cough-based AI for TB screening in real-world, low-resource settings.</description>
