      <title>Surface topological quantum criticality: Conformal manifolds and Discrete Strong Coupling Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study quantum critical phenomena in surfaces of symmetry-protected topological matter, i.e. surface topological quantum criticality. A generic phase boundary of gapless surfaces in a symmetry-protected state shall be a co-dimension one manifold in an interaction parameter space of dimension $D_p$ (where $p$ refers to the parameter space) where the value of $D_p$ further depends on bulk topologies. In the context of fermionic topological insulators that we focus on, $D_p$ depends on the number of half-Dirac cones $\mathcal{N}$. We construct such manifolds explicitly for a few interaction parameter spaces with various $D_p$ values. Most importantly, we further illustrate that in cases with $D_p=3$ and $6$, there are sub-manifolds of fixed points that dictate the universalities of surface topological quantum criticality. These infrared stable manifolds are associated with emergent symmetries in the renormalization-group-equation flow naturally appearing in the loop expansion. Unlike in the usual order-disorder quantum critical phenomena, typically governed by an isolated Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we find in the one-loop approximation surface topological quantum criticalities are naturally captured by conformal manifolds where the number of marginal operators uniquely determines their co-dimensions. Isolated strong coupling fixed points also appear, usually as the endpoints in the phase boundary of surface topological quantum phases. However, their extreme infrared instabilities along multiple directions suggest that they shall be related to multi-critical surface topological quantum critical phenomena rather than generic surface topological quantum criticality. We also discuss and classify higher-loop symmetry-breaking effects, which can either distort the conformal manifolds or further break the conformal manifolds down to a few distinct fixed points.</description>

      <title>Glassy Relaxation Dynamics in the Two-Dimensional Heavy Fermion Antiferromagnet CeSiI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the van der Waals (vdW) layered heavy fermion antiferromagnetic metal CeSiI offers promising potential for achieving accessible quantum criticality in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. CeSiI exhibits both heavy fermion behavior and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering, while the exact magnetic structure and phase diagram have yet to be determined. Here, we investigate magnetic properties of atomically thin CeSiI devices with thicknesses ranging from 2-15 vdW layers. The thickness-dependent magnetotransport measurement reveals an intrinsic 2D nature of heavy fermion behavior and antiferromagnetism. Notably, we also find an isotropic, time-dependent hysteresis in both magnetoresistance and Hall resistance, showing glassy relaxation dynamics. This glassy behavior in magnetic structures may suggest the presence of spin glass phases or multipolar ordering, further establishing CeSiI as an intriguing material system for investigating the interplay between magnetic orders and the Kondo effect.</description>

      <title>Edge-Edge Correlations without Edge-States: $\eta$-clustering State as Ground State of the Extended Attractive SU(3) Hubbard Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of the extended attractive SU($3$) Hubbard chain with two-body hopping and nearest-neighbor attraction at half-filling. In the large on-site attraction limit, we identify three different phases: phase separation (PS), Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and charge density wave (CDW). Our analysis reveals that the $\eta$-clustering state, a three-component generalization of the $\eta$-pairing state, becomes the ground state at the boundary between the PS and TLL phases. On an open chain, this state exhibits an edge-edge correlation, which we call boundary off-diagonal long-range order (bODLRO). Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we numerically study the phase diagram of the model with large but finite on-site interactions and find that the numerical results align with those obtained in the strong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the dynamic charge susceptibility near the charge density wave transition in ErTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.</description>

      <title>Thermal expansion in rare-earth cage systems: examples from the RB6 and RPt4Ge12 series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some intermetallic compounds, the crystallographic structure allows for an unusual latitude of movement of lanthanide ions inside so-called cages. Examples of such magnetic cage systems include the rare-earth hexaborides RB6 and filled skutterudites RPt4Ge12 series. In both instances, the rare-earth site, at the center of the cage, is of high symmetry, which may preserve some degree of orbital degeneracy. A deviation from the cage center lifts this degeneracy, yielding an interplay between the rare-earth movement and the system properties in the paramagnetic range. In particular, the low temperature thermal expansion should reflect this cage-specific crystal field contribution. This study presents an experimental investigation of the thermal expansion in the paramagnetic range of some elements in the aforementioned series. From a simple model for the vibrations in cage systems, a description of the phononic thermal expansion is proposed, within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Accounting for this non-magnetic contributions helps discern the influence of the orbital degeneracy at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Covariance-based method for eigenstate factorization and generalized singlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04426v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a general method for determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for exact factorization $|\Psi\rangle=\otimes_p |\psi_p\rangle$ of an eigenstate of a many-body Hamiltonian $H$, based on the quantum covariance matrix of the relevant local operators building the Hamiltonian. The "site" $p$ can be either a single component or a group of subsystems. The formalism is then used to derive exact dimerization and clusterization conditions in spin systems, covering from spin-$s$ singlets and clusters coupled to $0$ total spin to general nonmaximally entangled spin-$s$ dimers (generalized singlets). New results for field induced dimerization in anisotropic $XYZ$ arrays under a magnetic field are obtained.</description>

      <title>Collective mode across the BCS-BEC crossover in Holstein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of the collective mode in the phonon spectra of the superconducting state within the Holstein model by varying the electron-phonon coupling. Using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) combined with the numerical renormalization group (NRG) technique, we calculate the phonon spectra. In the superconducting state with a pairing gap ($\Delta_P$), the peak position of the collective mode ($\omega_{col}$) evolves from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) regime, manifesting near $2\Delta_P$ and increasing with coupling, to the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) regime, where $\omega_{col}$ decreases with increasing coupling. The decrease of $\omega_{col}$ matches well with the reduction of superfluid stiffness, which originates from the increasing phase fluctuations of local pairs with coupling strength. In the crossover regime with intermediate coupling, $\omega_{col}$ aligns with the soft phonon mode ($\omega_s$) of the normal state and decreases with increasing coupling when $\omega_s &lt; 2\Delta_P$. Additionally, comparing the collective mode weight to $\Delta_P$ suggests that the collective mode predominantly stems from U(1) gauge symmetry breaking across all coupling strengths.</description>

      <title>Non-Majorana-origin of the half-integer conductance quantization elucidated by multi-terminal superconductor-quantum anomalous Hall insulator heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.</description>

      <title>Magnon spintronics with Van der Waals magnets: from fundamentals to devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spintronics is concerned with replacing charge current with current of spin, the electron's intrinsic angular momentum. In magnetic insulators, spin currents are carried by magnons, the quanta of spin-wave excitations on top of the magnetically ordered state. Magnon spin currents are especially promising for information technology due to their low intrinsic damping, non-reciprocal transport, micrometer wavelengths at microwave frequencies, and strong interactions that enable signal transduction. In this perspective, we give our view on the progress and challenges towards realizing magnon spintronics based on atomically thin Van der Waals magnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials of which the tunability and versatility has attracted a great deal of ongoing research.</description>

Abstract: The search for ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model has been a problem of outstanding interest since Nagaoka's original proposal in 1966. Recent advances in quantum simulation have today enabled the study of tunable doped Hubbard models in ultracold atomic systems. Employing large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we establish the existence of high-spin ground states of the Hubbard model on finite-sized triangular lattices, analyze the microscopic mechanisms behind their origin, and investigate the interplay between ferromagnetism and other competing orders, such as stripes. These results explain$\unicode{x2014}$and shed new light on$\unicode{x2014}$the intriguing observations of ferromagnetic correlations in recent optical-lattice experiments. Additionally, we examine a generalized variant of the Hubbard model, wherein any second electron on a single lattice site is weakly bound compared to the first one, and demonstrate how this modification can lead to enhanced ferromagnetism, at intermediate length scales, on the nonfrustrated square lattice as well.</description>

Abstract: The search for elusive Nagaoka-type ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model has recently enjoyed renewed attention with the advent of a variety of experimental platforms enabling its realization, including moir\'e materials, quantum dots, and ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Here, we demonstrate a universal mechanism for Nagaoka ferromagnetism (that applies to both bipartite and nonbipartite lattices) based on the formation of ferromagnetic polarons consisting of a dopant dressed with polarized spins. Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we present a comprehensive study of the ferromagnetic polaron in an electron-doped Hubbard model, establishing various polaronic properties such as its size and energetics. Moreover, we systematically probe the internal structure of the magnetic state$\unicode{x2014}$through the use of pinning fields and three-point spin-charge-spin correlation functions$\unicode{x2014}$for both the single-polaron limit and the high-density regime of interacting polarons. Our results highlight the crucial role of mobile polarons in the birth of global ferromagnetic order from local ferromagnetism and provide a unified framework to understand the development and demise of the Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic state across dopings.</description>

      <title>Accessing Excitation of Many-body Systems via Single-Mode Approximation within Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08626v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the single-mode Approximation (SMA) into quantum Monte Carlo simulations to provides an efficient and fast method to obtain the dynamical dispersion of quantum many-body systems. Based on stochastic series expansion (SSE) and its projector algorithms, the SMA + SSE method can simply extract the dispersion of the dynamical dispersion in the long wave-length limit and the upper bound of the dispersion elsewhere, without external calculations and high technique barriers. Meanwhile, numerical analytic continuation methods require the fine data of imaginary time correlations and complex programming. Therefore, our method can approach the excitation dispersion of large systems, e.g., we take the two-dimensional Heisenberg model on a $512 \times 512$ square lattice. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method with high precision via additional examples. We also demonstrate that SMA combined with SSE goes beyond spin-wave theory with numerical results. We further illustrate that SMA is able to extract useful information in strongly correlated systems with competing states.</description>

      <title>Parent Hamiltonian for Fully-augmented Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or matrix product states (MPS) is the most effective and accurate method for studying one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, the application of DMRG to two-dimensional systems is not as successful because of the limited entanglement encoded in the wave-function ansatz. The fully augmented matrix product states (FAMPS), introduced recently in [Chin. Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023)], extends MPS formalism to two dimensions and increases the entanglement in the wave-function ansatz, representing a significant advance in the simulation of two-dimensional quantum many-body physics. In the study of one-dimensional systems, the concept of a parent Hamiltonian for MPS has proven pivotal in the understanding of quantum entanglement. In this work, we extend this framework to two-dimensional systems. We illustrate the procedure to construct a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with given FAMPS as its exact ground state (the parent Hamiltonian for FAMPS). Additionally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm outlined in [Chin. Phys. Lett. 40, 057102 (2023)] in precisely identifying the FAMPS for the constructed parent Hamiltonian. The introduction of FAMPS and its associated parent Hamiltonian provides a useful framework for the future investigations of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: In frustrated magnets, a variety of novel phenomena arise due to their peculiar magnetic states, whose excitations usually reside in the GHz to THz range. Intense THz lasers, therefore, lead to examining nonlinear optical effects in such magnets. Employing an unbiased numerical method, we calculate the laser-pulse driven harmonic spectra of the Shastry-Sutherland magnets, which is well known as the model of a quantum frustrated magnet $SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$. As a result, nonlinear responses of triplons and a two-triplon bound state are observed through the Zeeman or magnetoelectric couplings between the laser and the electron spin. Furthermore, we find that one can obtain information on magnetic anisotropy and symmetry from the spectra by manipulating external fields or two-color lasers. Our results indicate that laser-driven harmonic spectra are useful as a probe of less-detectable quantum many-body states in frustrated magnets.</description>

Abstract: In three dimensions, there is a nontrivial quantum cellular automaton (QCA) which disentangles the three-fermion Walker--Wang model, a model whose action depends on Stiefel--Whitney classes of the spacetime manifold. Here we present a conjectured generalization to higher dimensions. For an arbitrary symmetry protected topological phase of time reversal whose action depends on Stiefel--Whitney classes, we construct a corresponding QCA that we conjecture disentangles that phase. Some of our QCA are Clifford, and we relate these to a classification theorem of Clifford QCA. We identify Clifford QCA in $4m+1$ dimensions, for which we find a low-depth circuit description using non-Clifford gates but not with Clifford gates.</description>

      <title>Ising-type quantum spin liquid state in PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have grown single crystals of PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, an ideal triangular-lattice antiferromagnet, and performed magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements at low temperatures. The main results are as follows: (i) The temperature-dependent susceptibility shows a negligible in-plane response and the isothermal magnetization curves confirm the easy axis along the $c$ axis. (ii) The specific heat measurements reveal the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 60 mK, and the power-law temperature dependence indicates the existence of the gapless magnetic excitations in system. (iii) The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity exhibits negligibly small residual term ($\kappa_0/T$) and strong spin-phonon scattering effect, suggesting that the spin excitations are also involved. Our results further demonstrate that PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ is a rare quantum spin liquid candidate with Ising-like anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Ising domain wall networks from intertwined charge density waves in single-layer TiSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the period of an incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) approaches an integer multiple of a lattice vector, the energy gain obtained from locking the period to the lattice can lead to a fascinating transition into a commensurate state. This transition actually occurs through an intermediate near-commensurate (NC) phase, with locally commensurate regions separated by an ordered array of phase slips of a complex CDW order parameter. TiSe2 is a paradigmatic CDW system where incommensuration is believed to be induced by carrier doping, yet its putative NC state has never been imaged or its nature established. Here we report the observation of a striking NC state in ultraclean, slightly doped monolayers of TiSe2, displaying an intricate network of coherent, unidirectional CDW domain walls over hundreds of nanometers. Detailed analysis reveals these are not phase slips of a complex CDW, but rather sign-changing Ising-type domain walls of two coupled real CDWs of previously known symmetry, consistent with the period doubling nature of the parent commensurate state. In addition, we observe an unexpected nematic modulation at the original lattice Bragg peaks which couples to the CDW order parameters. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis naturally explains the couplings and relative modulations of all order parameters, unveiling TiSe2 as a rare example of an NC-CDW of two intertwined real modulations and emergent nematicity.</description>

      <title>Constructing quantum codes from any classical code and their embedding in ground space of local Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.01453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implementing robust quantum error correction (QEC) is imperative for harnessing the promise of quantum technologies. We introduce a framework that takes {\it any} classical code and explicitly constructs the corresponding QEC code. Our framework can be seen to generalize the CSS codes, and goes beyond the stabilizer formalism~(Fig.~1). A concrete advantage is that the desirable properties of a classical code are automatically incorporated in the design of the resulting quantum code. We reify the theory by various illustrations some of which outperform the best previous constructions. We then introduce a local quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian whose ground space we analytically completely characterize. We utilize our framework to demonstrate that the ground space contains explicit quantum codes with linear distance. This side-steps the Bravyi-Terhal no-go theorem.</description>

      <title>Symmetry invariants and classes of quasiparticles in magnetically ordered systems having weak spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.12738v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry invariants of a group specify the classes of quasiparticles, namely the classes of projective irreducible co-representations in systems having that symmetry. More symmetry invariants exist in discrete point groups than the full rotation group $\mathrm{O(3)}$, leading to new quasiparticles restricted to lattices that do not have any counterpart in a vacuum. We focus on the fermionic quasiparticle excitations under ``spin-space group'' symmetries, applicable to materials where long-range magnetic order and itinerant electrons coexist. We provide a list of 218 classes of new quasiparticles that can only be realized in the spin-space groups. These quasiparticles have at least one of the following properties that are qualitatively distinct from those discovered in magnetic space group(MSG)s, and distinct from each other:(i) degree of degeneracy,(ii) dispersion as function of momentum, and(iii) rules of coupling to external probe fields. We rigorously prove this result as a theorem that directly relates these properties to the symmetry invariants, and then illustrate this theorem with a concrete example, by comparing three 12-fold fermions having different sets of symmetry invariants including one discovered in MSG. Our approach can be generalized to realize more quasiparticles whose little co-groups are beyond those considered in our work.</description>

Abstract: Topological states of matter are promising resources for composing fault-tolerant quantum computers, advancing beyond the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. To enable this progress, a deep understanding of topological phenomena within actual quantum computing platforms is essential. However, existing quantum-circuit algorithms to examine topological properties remain limited. Here we introduce three quantum-circuit algorithms designed to (i) determine the ground state within a specified parity subspace, (ii) identify the many-body topological invariant, and (iii) visualize zero-energy edge modes. We illustrate these algorithms with the interacting Kitaev chain, a typical model of one-dimensional topological superconductors. These approaches are versatile, extending beyond one-dimensional systems to various topological states, including those in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate one- and two-photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) by examining the effects of tuning the twist angle $ \theta $ and the excitation energy $ E_l $ on its absorption coefficients $ \alpha_{i=1,2}$. We find that $ \alpha_1 $ as a function of $ E_l $ for TBLG exhibits distinct peaks corresponding to its van Hove singularities (vHs). For small twist angles, such as $\theta \sim 1.8^{\circ}$, the magnitude of the resonant peak for $\alpha_1$ is roughly twice that of bilayer graphene (BLG). This enhanced response, compared to BLG, can be attributed to the increased density of states (DOS) in the twisted structure. However, as the twist angle increases the magnitude of the resonant peak approaches that of two decoupled single-layer graphene (SLG) sheets. On the other hand, the two-photon absorption coefficient $ \alpha_2 $ for TBLG at low twist angles displays an enhancement of about one order of magnitude compared to SLG at the energies corresponding to the resonant peak, as well as a small but notable increase relative to BLG. As the twist angle decreases from $ 8^{\circ} $ to $ 2.5^{\circ} $, the resonant peak intensifies by three orders of magnitude. Interestingly, as $\theta$ increases the resonant features exhibited by $\alpha_{i=1,2}$ \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ shift progressively from the infrared to the visible. On doping TBLG, both $\alpha_1 $ and $ \alpha_2 $ \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ remain essentially unchanged but with a slight red-shift in their resonant peaks. Additionally, we explore various polarization configurations for two-photon absorption and determine the conditions under which $\alpha_2$ becomes extremal.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of the origin of the double-well band dispersion in the CuO double chains of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ and its impact on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ is a unique member of cuprate superconductors where many studies suggest that CuO double chains are responsible for superconductivity. One characteristic and non-trivial feature of its electronic structure is a relatively large electron hopping $t$ between nearest neighbor Cu sites with a Cu-O-Cu angle of around 90 degrees. In this study, we have theoretically pinned down the origin of a large $|t|$ in the double-chain structure of Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$ using first-principles calculation and tight-binding-model analysis. We have found that, in the nearest neighbor hopping $t$, $d$-$d$ and $d$-$p$-$p$-$d$ contributions roughly cancel each other out and the $d$-$p$-$d$ hopping path enhanced by the local distortion of the double chain is a key to get the large $|t|$. Double-well band dispersion arising from the relatively large $|t/t'|$ allows the enhancement of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity by the incipient-band mechanism, where the one band bottom plays a role of the incipient valley. Our study provides the important knowledge to understand the unique superconductivity in Pr$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15-\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Ising superconductivity in the bulk incommensurate layered material (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the spin-valley degree of freedom of electrons in materials is a promising avenue for energy-efficient information storage and quantum computing. A key challenge in utilizing spin-valley polarization is the realization of spin-valley locking in bulk systems. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the noncentrosymmetric bulk misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$(TaS$_2$), showing a strong spin-valley locking. Our investigation reveals Ising superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.14 K, closely matching that of a monolayer of TaS$_2$. Notably, the absence of charge density wave (CDW) signatures in transport measurements suggests that the PbS layers primarily act as spacers between the dichalcogenide monolayers.
  This is further supported by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), which shows negligible interlayer coupling, a lack of dispersion along the $k_{\perp}$ direction and significant charge transfer from the PbS to the TaS$_2$ layers. Spin resolved ARPES shows strong spin-valley locking of the electronic bands.
  Muon spin rotation experiments conducted in the vortex phase reveal an isotropic superconducting gap. However, the temperature dependence of the upper critical field and low-temperature specific heat measurements suggest the possibility of multigap superconductivity.
  These findings underscore the potential of misfit compounds as robust platforms for both realizing and utilizing spin-valley locking in bulk materials, as well as exploring proximity effects in two-dimensional structures.</description>
