      <title>A physics-constrained deep learning surrogate model of the runaway electron avalanche growth rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surrogate model of the runaway electron avalanche growth rate in a magnetic fusion plasma is developed. This is accomplished by employing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to learn the parametric solution of the adjoint to the relativistic Fokker-Planck equation. The resulting PINN is able to evaluate the runaway probability function across a broad range of parameters in the absence of any synthetic or experimental data. This surrogate of the adjoint relativistic Fokker-Planck equation is then used to infer the avalanche growth rate as a function of the electric field, synchrotron radiation and effective charge. Predictions of the avalanche PINN are compared against first principle calculations of the avalanche growth rate with excellent agreement observed across a broad range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Validation of hydrodynamic and kinetic simulations with a plasma interpenetration ICF hohlraum experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on simulations of counter-propagating laser-produced plasmas in an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) hohlraum surrogate, aiming to replicate observations reported by Le Pape et. al in recent work. The conditions of the colliding plasmas are relevant to ICF hohlraums used for indirect-drive ignition, and are obtained both with and without low-density He-gas fill. We compare experimental diagnostics to outputs from simulations using the 1D-2V Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic code iFP and the xRAGE radiation-hydrodynamics code. These include the inferred radial lineouts of inferred ion number fraction and ion and electron temperatures, as well as the reported experimental Thomson-scattering (TS) spectra (compared via synthetic TS diagnostics). We observe that 1D kinetic simulations capture the plasma states reported in the experimental diagnostics quite well. Counter-intuitively, the kinetic simulations capture the gas-fill experiment (expected to be more `hydro-like') better than the vacuum experiment, while the reverse is observed for hydrodynamic simulations. This is attributed to the presence of non-trivial multi-dimensional hydrodynamic effects which are more dominant in the vacuum experiment. These effects are somewhat inhibited in the gas-fill experiment, permitting quasi-1D kinetic plasma transport to play more of a role in producing plasma interpenetration. Differences between the effects of Maxwellian vs. non-Maxwellian (`full f') synthetic TS diagnostics are investigated for the kinetic simulations. We find non-Maxwellian TS spectra differ non-trivially from Maxwellian spectra, which suggests caution may be warranted when applying Maxwellian TS models to infer plasma conditions via backward modeling when kinetic effects may be present.</description>

      <title>The effect of pressure-anisotropy-driven kinetic instabilities on magnetic field amplification in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) is the low-density diffuse magnetized plasma in galaxy clusters, which reaches virial temperatures of up to 10^8 K. Under these conditions, the plasma is weakly collisional and therefore has an anisotropic pressure tensor with respect to the local direction of the magnetic field. This triggers very fast, Larmor-scale, pressure-anisotropy-driven kinetic instabilities that alter magnetic field amplification. We study magnetic field amplification through a turbulent small-scale dynamo, including the effects of the kinetic instabilities, during the evolution of a typical massive galaxy cluster. A specific aim of this work is to establish a redshift limit from which a dynamo has to start to amplify the magnetic field up to equipartition with the turbulent velocity field at redshift z=0. We implemented 1D radial profiles for various plasma quantities for merger trees generated with the Modified GALFORM algorithm. We assume that turbulence is driven by successive mergers of dark matter halos and construct effective models for the Reynolds number Re_eff dependence on the magnetic field in three different magnetization regimes, including the effects of kinetic instabilities. The magnetic field growth rate is calculated for the different Re_eff models. The model results in a higher magnetic field growth rate at higher redshift. For all scenarios considered, to reach equipartition at z=0, the amplification of the magnetic field has to start at redshift z_start=1.5 and above. The time to reach equipartition can be significantly shorter, in cases with systematically smaller turbulent forcing scales, and for the highest Re_eff models. Merger trees are useful tools for studying the evolution of magnetic fields in weakly collisional plasmas. They could also be used to constrain the different stages of the dynamo that could be observed by future radio telescopes.</description>
