      <title>A theory of passive market impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the market impact of aggressive orders has been extensively studied, the impact of passive orders, those executed through limit orders, remains less understood. The goal of this paper is to investigate passive market impact by developing a microstructure model connecting liquidity dynamics and price moves. A key innovation of our approach is to replace the traditional assumption of constant information content for each trade by a function that depends on the available volume in the limit order book. Within this framework, we explore scaling limits and analyze the market impact of passive metaorders. Additionally, we derive useful approximations for the shape of market impact curves, leading to closed-form formulas that can be easily applied in practice.</description>

      <title>A Joint Energy and Differentially-Private Smart Meter Data Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the vital role that smart meter data could play in handling uncertainty in energy markets, data markets have been proposed as a means to enable increased data access. However, most extant literature considers energy markets and data markets separately, which ignores the interdependence between them. In addition, existing data market frameworks rely on a trusted entity to clear the market. This paper proposes a joint energy and data market focusing on the day-ahead retailer energy procurement problem with uncertain demand. The retailer can purchase differentially-private smart meter data from consumers to reduce uncertainty. The problem is modelled as an integrated forecasting and optimisation problem providing a means of valuing data directly rather than valuing forecasts or forecast accuracy. Value is determined by the Wasserstein distance, enabling privacy to be preserved during the valuation and procurement process. The value of joint energy and data clearing is highlighted through numerical case studies using both synthetic and real smart meter data.</description>
