      <title>Limited attention and models of choice: A behavioral equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that many models of choice can be alternatively represented as special cases of choice with limited attention (Masatlioglu, Nakajima, and Ozbay, 2012), and the properties of the unobserved attention filters that explain the observed choices are singled out. Moreover, for each specification, we infer information about the DM's attention and preference from irrational features of choice data.</description>

      <title>Dynamic User Competition and Miner Behavior in the Bitcoin Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a dynamic model of the Bitcoin market where users set fees themselves and miners decide whether to operate and whom to validate based on those fees. Our analysis reveals how, in equilibrium, users adjust their bids in response to short-term congestion (i.e., the amount of pending transactions), how miners decide when to start operating based on the level of congestion, and how the interplay between these two factors shapes the overall market dynamics. The miners hold off operating when the congestion is mild, which harms social welfare. However, we show that a block reward (a fixed reward paid to miners upon a block production) can mitigate these inefficiencies. We characterize the socially optimal block reward and demonstrate that it is always positive, suggesting that Bitcoin's halving schedule may be suboptimal.</description>

      <title>Protected Income and Inequality Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover a fundamental and previously unrecognized structure within the class of additively separable social welfare functions that makes it straightforward to fully characterize and elicit the social preferences of an inequality-averse evaluator. From this structure emerges a revealing question: if a large increment can be given to one individual in a society, what is the maximal sacrifice that another individual can be asked to bear for its sake? We show that the answer uncovers the evaluator's degree of inequality aversion. In particular, all translation-invariant evaluators would sacrifice the full income of the sacrificed individual if their income were low enough and a constant amount of their income otherwise. Scale-invariant evaluators would sacrifice the full income of the sacrificed individual at all income levels if their inequality aversion was no greater than one, and a constant fraction of their income otherwise. Motivated by these findings, we propose a class of social preferences that, starting from a minimum-income level of protection, ensure a higher fraction of the sacrificed individual's income is protected the lower their income.</description>

      <title>Tractable General Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Walrasian economies (or general equilibrium models) and their solution concept, the Walrasian equilibrium. A key challenge in this domain is identifying price-adjustment processes that converge to equilibrium. One such process, t\^atonnement, is an auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by L\'eon Walras. While continuous-time variants of t\^atonnement are known to converge to equilibrium in economies satisfying the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP), the process fails to converge in a pathological Walrasian economy known as the Scarf economy. To address these issues, we analyze Walrasian economies using variational inequalities (VIs), an optimization framework. We introduce the class of mirror extragradient algorithms, which, under suitable Lipschitz-continuity-like assumptions, converge to a solution of any VI satisfying the Minty condition in polynomial time. We show that the set of Walrasian equilibria of any balanced economy-which includes among others Arrow-Debreu economies-corresponds to the solution set of an associated VI that satisfies the Minty condition but is generally discontinuous. Applying the mirror extragradient algorithm to this VI we obtain a class of t\^atonnement-like processes, which we call the mirror extrat\^atonnement process. While our VI formulation is generally discontinuous, it is Lipschitz-continuous in variationally stable Walrasian economies with bounded elasticity-including those satisfying WARP and the Scarf economy-thus establishing the polynomial-time convergence of mirror extrat\^atonnement in these economies. We validate our approach through experiments on large Arrow-Debreu economies with Cobb-Douglas, Leontief, and CES consumers, as well as the Scarf economy, demonstrating fast convergence in all cases without failure.</description>
