      <title>Soviet Mathematics and Economic Theory in the Past Century: An Historical Reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What are the effects of authoritarian regimes on scholarly research in economics? And how might economic theory survive ideological pressures? The article addresses these questions by focusing on the mathematization of economics over the past century and drawing on the history of Soviet science. Mathematics in the USSR remained internationally competitive and generated many ideas that were taken up and played important roles in economic theory. These same ideas, however, were disregarded or adopted only in piecemeal fashion by Soviet economists, despite the efforts of influential scholars to change the economic research agenda. The article draws this contrast into sharper focus by exploring the work of Soviet mathematicians in optimization, game theory, and probability theory that was used in Western economics. While the intellectual exchange across the Iron Curtain did help advance the formal modeling apparatus, economics could only thrive in an intellectually open environment absent under the Soviet rule.</description>

      <title>Motivated exposition of combinatorial Nullstellensatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this expository note we show how combinatorial Nullstellensatz by N. Alon naturally appears in solutions of elementary problems. Simple ideas gradually and naturally appear in such solutions, thus bringing a reader to generalizations. The note is accessible to mathematicians not specialized in the area, and to students familiar with polynomials.</description>
