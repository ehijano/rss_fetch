      <title>On the Kelly monoidal structure of $\Lambda$-sequences and unital operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be the category of based finite sets $\mathbf{n}$ and based injections. We study properties of monoids and modules in $\Lambda$-sequences under the Kelly monoidal structure. In particular, we show that the forgetful functor from right modules in $\Lambda$-sequences to right modules in symmetric sequences is an isomorphism. We show that any compatible lower data extends to a normal oplax monoidal structure and use this to establish a universal normal oplax monoidal structure on $\Lambda$-sequences extending the Kelly product, identifying unital operads to monoids in unital $\Lambda$-sequences for a general symmetric monoidal category $\mathscr{V}$. We also establish a closed monoidal localization theorem.</description>

      <title>Canonical torsion linking pairings and explicit TMF state spaces of closed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the TMF-valued $(3+1)$-dimensional TQFT of Gukov--Krushkal--Meier--Pei and give an explicit description of the TMF-module state space assigned to a closed $3$-manifold. Our starting point is the torsion linking pairing on $H_1$, viewed as a discriminant form. We construct a canonical, computable package of invariants for torsion linking pairings (uniformly for odd and $2$-primary parts), and from it a canonical tokenization together with an explicit symmetric integral matrix representative realizing the same stable class. This yields an explicit model for the GKMP state space in terms of a rank-one TMF-module $L_b$ with a canonical degree shift determined by signature data. As applications we identify the values on $CP^2$ and, conditional on a natural functoriality/duality statement in GKMP, on $S^2\times S^2$ with the Hopf elements $\pm\nu$ and $\eta$, respectively. Finally, we establish a rank-one time-reversal duality $L_{(-n)}\simeq L_{(n)}^\vee[1]$ for all integers $n$.</description>

      <title>On the equivariant triangulation of some small covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study certain properties of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-equivariant triangulations of small covers. We show that any $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-equivariant triangulation of a small cover naturally induces a triangulation of the orbit space. Then, we explicitly construct the minimal $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-equivariant triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^3$, which contains $11$ vertices and prove that this is the unique $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-equivariant triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ with $11$ vertices. For a finite group $G$, we give a method for constructing some $G$-equivariant triangulations of connected sums of manifolds from their respective $G$-equivariant triangulations. In particular, we construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$-equivariant triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^3 \# \mathbb{RP}^3$ with $17$ vertices, which is the best known yet. This triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^3 \# \mathbb{RP}^3$ provides another minimal $g$-vector improving one of the result of Lutz in \cite{LS}. Moreover, we prove that a $\ZZ_2^4$-equivariant triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^4$ requires at least $18$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons factorization algebras and knot polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work identifies the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of links in terms of a trace map on factorization homology. In particular, to recover the knot invariants associated to Chern-Simons theories, we construct a filtered $\mathcal{E}_3$-algebra $\mathcal{A}^\lambda$ by BV quantization of Chern-Simons theory for a semi-simple Lie algebra ${\frak g}$ with invariant pairing~$\lambda$, and we prove that a finite-dimensional representation $V$ of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group $U_\hbar{\frak g}$ defines a perfect $\mathcal{A}^\lambda$ module~$\mathcal{V}$. For any framed link $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we then prove that there is an equality \[\int_{K\subset\mathbb{R}^3}{\rm tr}(V) = Z_V(K\subset\mathbb{R}^3) \] between the factorization homology trace for $V$ and the Reshetikhin-Turaev link invariant determined by~$V$.</description>

      <title>On Discrete Morse-Bott Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that discrete Morse-Bott theory can be developed as a natural extension of R. Forman's discrete Morse theory by improving the definition of the discrete Morse-Bott function introduced by S. Yaptieu. To this end, we demonstrate that the combinatorial structure of critical cells can be extended to critical sets intuitively. Furthermore, we establish the discrete Morse-Bott inequalities, providing a unified view that extends both the discrete Morse inequalities and the continuous Morse-Bott inequalities.</description>

      <title>Homotopy properties of regular mappings into real retract rational varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homotopy properties of regular mappings from spheres into a real retract rational variety $Y$. We show that the homotopy classes which are represented by such mappings form subgroups of the homotopy groups of $Y$, and that the groups are independent of the choice of the basepoint on $Y$ as long as $Y$ is connected. We also construct regular representatives of all the Whitehead products in all the homotopy groups of $Y$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic tensor products and a Ganea-type extension of the five-term exact sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a right-exactness theorem for the cross-effects of bifunctors, and consequently for cosmash products, in Janelidze-M\'arki-Tholen semi-abelian categories. This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a symmetric bilinear, actually bi-right exact and for varieties even bi-cocontinuous product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain 2-nilpotent symmetric operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.
  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence. Finally, we characterise abelian extensions via internal action cores, yielding explicit descriptions of cosmash products and bilinear products in certain categories of representations.</description>
