      <title>The general ternary form can be recovered by its Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hessian map is the rational map that sends a homogeneous polynomial to the determinant of its Hessian matrix. We prove that the Hessian map is birational on its image for ternary forms of degree $d\ge 4$, $d\neq 5$, by considering the action of the orthogonal group. In a previous paper we proved the analogous result for binary forms, with more geometric techniques.</description>

      <title>Generic injectivity of Hessian maps of ternary forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any planar projective curve of degree $d \ge 4$ and with a smooth Hessian curve $H_f$ is uniquely determined by $H_f$. Taking into account that the Hessian curve is the ramification divisor associated with the polar map, we prove the statement using a geometric description of the graph of such a map. It turns out that in degree $d\ge 4$ two curves have the same smooth Hessian if and only if they have the same Jacobian ideal. The latter curves have been classified by C. Mammana, and they all have a reducible, hence singular, Hessian curve.
  As a consequence, the Hessian map, associating with a proportionality class of a ternary form the class of its Hessian determinant, is injective on the open locus corresponding to curves with smooth Hessian curve. This confirms a conjecture posed by C. Ciliberto and G. Ottaviani.</description>

      <title>Splitting of abelian varieties in motivic stable homotopy category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the motivic stable homotopy type of abelian varieties. For an abelian variety over a field $k$ with a rational point, it always splits off a top-dimensional cell in motivic stable homotopy category $\text{SH}(k)$. Let $k = \mathbb{R}$, there is a concrete splitting which is determined by the motive of X and the real points $X(\mathbb{R})$ in $\text{SH}(\mathbb{R})_\mathbb{Q}$. We will also discuss this splitting from a viewpoint of the Chow-Witt correspondences.</description>

Abstract: For any log Fano pair with a torus action, we associate a computable invariant to it, such that the pair is (weighted) K-polystable if and only if this invariant is greater than one. As an application, we present examples of Fano varieties admitting $g$-solitons for any weight function $g$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new system of relations in the tautological ring of the moduli space of curves involving stable rooted trees with level structure decorated by the top Chern class of the Hodge bundle and $\Omega$-classes and double ramification structures. In particular, this resolves a recent conjecture on these relations as well as connects with one of the two sides of the recently established DR/DZ equivalence between the integrable hierarchies constructions of Buryak and of Dubrovin--Zhang.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06242v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof of a conjecture of Q. Shi, Y. Wang and H. Zuo claiming that the maximal spectral number of a hypersurface isolated singularity does not belong to the Tjurina spectrum. This follows from the self-duality of the Jacobian ring, which is compatible with the action of $f$ and also with the $V$-filtration. We also provide a sufficient condition for the generalized Hertling conjecture on the variance of Tjurina spectrum to fail, and calculate some examples using some codes in Singular.</description>

      <title>Atiyah classes of Lie algebroid homotopy modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Lie algebroid pair $A\hookrightarrow L$ we study cocycles constructed from the extension to $L$ of the higher connection forms of a representation up to homotopy $E$ of the Lie algebroid $A$. We show that there exists a cohomology class with values in the endomorphism bundle of $E$ that is independent of the extension above and vanishes whenever a homotopy $A$-compatible extension exists. Whenever the representation up to homotopy $E$ is the resolution of a Lie algebroid representation $K$ of $A$, it is shown that there exists a quasi-isomorphism sending the new Atiyah class to the classical one, associated to extensions to $L$ of the Lie algebroid representation $K$.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a connection between a topological and a geometric category. The former is the idempotent completion of the (horizontal) trace of the affine Hecke category, while the latter is the equivariant derived category of the (semi-nilpotent) commuting stack. This provides a more precise and improved version of our proposal in [8].</description>

      <title>A quantum Murnaghan--Nakayama rule for the flag manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a rule for the multiplication of a Schubert class by a tautological
  class in the (small) quantum cohomology ring of the flag manifold.
  As an intermediate step, we establish a formula for the multiplication of
  a Schubert class by a quantum Schur polynomial indexed by a hook partition.
  This entails a detailed analysis of chains and intervals in the
  quantum Bruhat order.
  This analysis allows us to use results of Leung--Li and of Postnikov to reduce quantum
  products by hook Schur polynomials to the (known) classical product.</description>

      <title>The $F$-pure threshold and squarefree initial ideal as invariants of linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generic link of an unmixed, radical (even a generic complete intersection) ideal is radical (in fact, prime). We show that this cannot be strengthened in general: The squarefreeness of the initial ideal and $F$-purity are not preserved along generic links. However, for several important cases in liaison theory, including generic height three Gorenstein ideals and the maximal minors of a generic matrix, we show that the squarefreeness of the initial ideal, $F$-purity, and even the $F$-pure threshold are each preserved along the $n$-th generic link for every $n&gt;0$ by finding a property of such ideals which propagates along generic links. We use this property to establish the $F$-regularity of their generic links. Finally, we study the $F$-pure thresholds of the generic residual intersections of a complete intersection ideal and answer a related question of Kim--Miller--Niu.</description>

      <title>Schubert coefficients of sparse paving matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chow class of the closure of the torus orbit of a point in a Grassmannian only depends on the matroid associated to the point. The Chow class can be extended to a matroid invariant of arbitrary matroids. We call the coefficients appearing in the expansion of the Chow class in the Schubert basis the Schubert coefficients of the matroid. These Schubert coefficients are conjectured by Berget and Fink to be non-negative. We compute the Schubert coefficients for all sparse paving matroids, and confirm their non-negativity.</description>

      <title>$G_0$ of affine, simplicial toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an affine, simplicial toric variety over a field. Let $G_0$ denote the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on a Noetherian scheme and let $F^1G_0$ denote the first step of the filtration on $G_0$ by codimension of support. Then $G_0(X)\cong\mathbb{Z}\oplus F^1G_0(X)$ and $F^1G_0(X)$ is a finite abelian group. In dimension 2, we show that $F^1G_0(X)$ is a finite cyclic group and determine its order. In dimension 3, $F^1G_0(X)$ is determined up to a group extension of the Chow group $A^1(X)$ by the Chow group $A^2(X)$. We determine the order of the Chow group $A^1(X)$ in this case. A conjecture on the orders of $A^1(X)$ and $A^2(X)$ is formulated for all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series for contractads and modular compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contractads are operadic-type algebraic structures well-suited for describing configuration spaces indexed by a simple connected graph $\Gamma$. Specifically, these configuration spaces are defined as $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(X):=X^{|V(\Gamma)|}\setminus \cup_{(ij)\in E(\Gamma)} {x_i=x_j}$. In this paper, we explore functional equations for the Hilbert series of Koszul dual contractads and provide explicit Hilbert series for fundamental contractads such as the commutative, Lie, associative and the little discs contractads.
  Additionally, we focus on a particular contractad derived from the wonderful compactifications of $\mathrm{Conf}_{\Gamma}(\mathbb{k})$, for $\mathbb{k}=\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$. First, we demonstrate that for complete multipartite graphs, the associated wonderful compactifications coincide with the modular compactifications introduced by Smyth. Second, we establish that the homology of the complex points and the homology of the real locus of the wonderful contractad are both quadratic and Koszul contractads. We offer a detailed description of generators and relations, extending the concepts of the Hypercommutative operad and cacti operads, respectively.
  Furthermore, using the functional equations for the Hilbert series, we describe the corresponding Hilbert series for the homology of modular compactifications.
  We hope this work will highlight the concept of contractads and their applications in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>A Twisted Adiabatic Limit Approach to Vanishing Theorems for Complex Line Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an $n$-dimensional compact complex Hermitian manifold $X$, a $C^\infty$ complex line bundle $L$ equipped with a connection $D$ whose $(0,\,1)$-component $D''$ squares to zero and a real-valued function $\eta$ on $X$, we prove that the $D''$-cohomology group of $L$ of any bidegree $(p,\,q)$ such that either $(p&gt;q \hspace{1ex}\mbox{and}\hspace{1ex} p+q\geq n+1)$ or $(p&lt;q \hspace{1ex}\mbox{and}\hspace{1ex} p+q\leq n-1)$ vanishes when two extra hypotheses are made. The first hypothesis requires a certain real-valued, not necessarily closed, $(1,\,1)$-form depending on $p,\,q$, on the curvature of $D$ and on a $(1,\,1)$-form induced by $\eta$ to be positive definite. The second hypothesis requires the norm of $\partial\eta$ to be small relative to $|\eta|$. This theorem, for which we also give a number of variants, is proved by generalising our very recent twisted adiabatic limit construction for complex structures to connections on complex line bundles. This twisting of $D$ induces first-order differential operators acting on the $L$-valued forms, for which we obtain commutation relations involving their formal adjoints, and two twisted Laplacians for which we obtain a comparison formula reminiscent of the classical Bochner-Kodaira-Nakano identity. The main features of our results are that $X$ need not be K\"ahler, $L$ need not be holomorphic and the types of $C^\infty$ functions that $X$ supports play a key role in our hypotheses, thus capturing some of their links with the geometry of manifolds.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of F-cohomological field theories and F-topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define F-topological recursion (F-TR) as a non-symmetric version of topological recursion, which associates a vector potential to some initial data. We describe the symmetries of the initial data for F-TR and show that, at the level of the vector potential, they include the F-Givental (non-linear) symmetries studied by Arsie, Buryak, Lorenzoni, and Rossi within the framework of F-manifolds. Additionally, we propose a spectral curve formulation of F-topological recursion. This allows us to extend the correspondence between semisimple cohomological field theories (CohFTs) and topological recursion, as established by Dunin-Barkowski, Orantin, Shadrin, and Spitz, to the F-world. In the absence of a full reconstruction theorem \`a la Teleman for F-CohFTs, this demonstrates that F-TR holds for the ancestor vector potential of a given F-CohFT if and only if it holds for some F-CohFT in its F-Givental orbit. We turn this into a useful statement by showing that the correlation functions of F-topological field theories (F-CohFTs of cohomological degree 0) are governed by F-TR. We apply these results to the extended 2-spin F-CohFT. Furthermore, we exhibit a large set of linear symmetries of F-CohFTs, which do not commute with the F-Givental action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $p$-Adic divergence and gradient operators are constructed giving rise to $p$-adic vertex Laplacian operators used by Z\'u\~niga in order to study Turing patterns on graphs, as well as their edge Laplacian counterparts. It is shown that the Euler characteristic of a finite graph can be expressed via traces of certain heat kernels associated with these new operators. This result is applied to the extraction of topological information from Mumford curves via heat kernels.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of weighted projective hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07872v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several results concerning automorphism groups of quasismooth complex weighted projective hypersurfaces; these generalize and strengthen existing results for hypersurfaces in ordinary projective space. First, we prove in most cases that automorphisms extend to the ambient weighted projective space. We next provide a characterization of when the linear automorphism group is finite and find an explicit uniform upper bound on the size of this group. Finally, we describe the automorphisms of a generic quasismooth hypersurface with given weights and degree.</description>

      <title>The period-index conjecture for abelian threefolds and Donaldson-Thomas theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the period-index conjecture for unramified Brauer classes on abelian threefolds. To do so, we develop a theory of reduced Donaldson-Thomas invariants for 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories, with the feature that the noncommutative variational integral Hodge conjecture holds for classes with nonvanishing invariant. The period-index result is then proved by interpreting it as the algebraicity of a Hodge class on the twisted derived category, and specializing within the Hodge locus to an untwisted abelian threefold with nonvanishing invariant. As a consequence, we also deduce the integral Hodge conjecture for generically twisted abelian threefolds.</description>

      <title>The Wu relations in real algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study relations between Chern classes and Galois cohomology classes in the Gal(C/R)-equivariant cohomology of real algebraic varieties with no real points. We give applications to the topology of their sets of complex points, and to sums of squares problems. In particular, we show that -1 is a sum of 2 squares in the function field of any smooth projective real algebraic surface with no real points and with vanishing geometric genus, as well as higher-dimensional generalizations of this result.</description>

      <title>On the Tensor Property of Bernstein-Sato Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the multiplicative Thom-Sebastiani rule for Bernstein-Sato polynomials, answering the longstanding questions of Budur and Popa. We generalize the result to the tensor of two effective divisors on the product of two arbitrary non-singular complex varieties. This also leads to a multiplicative property related to Igusa's strong monodromy conjecture. Moreover, we propose an extension of our result to Bernstein-Sato polynomials for ideals and prove it for monomial ideals.</description>

Abstract: The convolution ring $K^{GL_n(\mathcal{O})\rtimes\mathbb{C}^\times}(\mathrm{Gr}_{GL_n})$ was identified with a quantum unipotent cell of the loop group $LSL_2$ in [Cautis-Williams, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 32 (2019), pp. 709-778]. We identify the basis formed by the classes of irreducible equivariant perverse coherent sheaves with the dual canonical basis of the quantum unipotent cell.</description>

      <title>The perfectoid Tate algebra has uncountable Krull dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let \(K\) be a perfectoid field with pseudo-uniformizer \(\pi\). We adapt an argument of Du in \cite{DuUncountable} to show that the perfectoid Tate algebra \(K\langle x^{1 / p^{\infty}} \rangle\) has an uncountable chain of distinct prime ideals. First, we conceptualize Du's argument, defining the notion of a \textit{Newton polygon formalism} on a ring. We prove a version of Du's theorem in the prescence of a sufficiently nondiscrete Newton polygon formalism. Then, we apply our framework to the perfectoid Tate algebra via a "nonstandard" Newton polygon formalism (roughly, the roles of the series variable \(x\) and the pseudo-uniformizer \(\pi\) are switched). We conclude a similar statement for multivatiate perfectoid Tate algebras using the one-variable case.</description>

Fix a line $L_{a.b}:y=\frac{a}{b}x$ where $a\in \mathbb{Z},b\in \mathbb{N}$ and $(a,b)=1$. We study sufficient conditions that $p$ and $q$ must satisfy so that there are infinitely many elliptic curves $E_{p,q}$ that intersect $L_{a,b}$.</description>

      <title>The Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron and Parke-Taylor identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amplituhedron $A_{n,k,m}$ is a geometric object introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes in $N=4$ super Yang Mills. It generalizes the positive Grassmannian (when $n=k+m$), cyclic polytopes (when $k=1$), and the bounded complex of the cyclic hyperplane arrangement (when $m=1$). Of substantial interest are the tilings of the amplituhedron, which are analogous to triangulations of a polytope. Karp, Williams and Zhang (2020) observed that the known tilings of $A_{n,k,2}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$ and the known tilings of $A_{n,k,4}$ have cardinality the Narayana number $\frac{1}{n-3}{n-3 \choose k+1}{n-3 \choose k}$; generalizing these observations, they conjectured that for even $m$ the tilings of $A_{n, k,m}$ have cardinality the MacMahon number, the number of plane partitions which fit inside a $k \times (n-k-m) \times \frac{m}{2}$ box. We refer to this prediction as the `Magic Number Conjecture'. In this paper we prove the Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron: that is, we show that each tiling of $A_{n,k,2}$ has cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$. We prove this by showing that all positroid tilings of the hypersimplex $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$, then applying T-duality. In addition, we give combinatorial necessary conditions for tiles to form a tiling of $A_{n,k,2}$; we give volume formulas for Parke-Taylor polytopes and certain positroid polytopes in terms of circular extensions of cyclic partial orders; and we prove new variants of the classical Parke-Taylor identities.</description>

      <title>A transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets with application to signal recovery from the second moment and cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-algebraic priors are ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Prevalent examples include a) linear models where the signal lies in a low-dimensional subspace; b) sparse models where the signal can be represented by only a few coefficients under a suitable basis; and c) a large family of neural network generative models. In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets in orthogonal or unitary representations of groups: with a suitable dimension bound, a generic translate of any semi-algebraic set is transverse to the orbits of the group action. This, in turn, implies that if a signal lies in a low-dimensional semi-algebraic set, then it can be recovered uniquely from measurements that separate orbits.
  As an application, we consider the implications of the transversality theorem to the problem of recovering signals that are translated by random group actions from their second moment. As a special case, we discuss cryo-EM: a leading technology to constitute the spatial structure of biological molecules, which serves as our prime motivation. In particular, we derive explicit bounds for recovering a molecular structure from the second moment under a semi-algebraic prior and deduce information-theoretic implications. We also obtain information-theoretic bounds for three additional applications: factoring Gram matrices, multi-reference alignment, and phase retrieval. Finally, we deduce bounds for designing permutation invariant separators in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Series of Bipartite Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of the mesonic moduli spaces of bipartite field theories by computing the Hilbert series. Bipartite field theories form a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that are defined by bipartite graphs on Riemann surfaces with boundaries. By calculating the Hilbert series, we are able to identify the generators and defining generator relations of the mesonic moduli spaces of these theories. Moreover, we show that certain bipartite field theories exhibit enhanced global symmetries which can be identified through the computation of the corresponding refined Hilbert series. As part of our study, we introduce two one-parameter families of bipartite field theories defined on cylinders whose mesonic moduli spaces are all complete intersection toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds.</description>

      <title>Cokernels of the Euler restriction map of logarithmic derivation modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are two restriction maps of the logarithmic modules of plane arrangements in a three dimensional vector space. One is the Euler restriction and the other is the Ziegler restriction. The dimension of the cokernel of the Ziegler restriction map of logarithmic derivation modules has been well-studied for the freeness of hyperplane arrangements after Yoshinaga's celebrated criterion for freeness, which connects the second Betti number and the splitting type (exponents). However, though the Euler restriction has a longer history than the Ziegler restriction, the cokernel and its dimension of the Euler restriction have not been studied at all.
  The aim of this article is to study the cokernel and dimension of the Euler restriction maps in terms of combinatorics, more explicitly, the characteristic polynomial. We give an upper bound of that cokernel, and show the formula for that if the arrangement is free.</description>
