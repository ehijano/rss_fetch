      <title>Properties of Sub-Add Move Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a move graph, that is, a directed graph whose vertex set is a $\mathbb Z$-module $\mathbb Z_n^m$, and whose arc set is uniquely determined by the action $M\!:\!\mathbb Z_n^m\to \mathbb Z_n^m$ where $M$ is an $m\times m$ matrix with integer entries. We study the manner in which properties of move graphs differ when one varies the choice of cyclic group $\mathbb Z_n$. Our principal focus is on a special family of such graphs, which we refer to as ``sub-add move graphs.''</description>

      <title>Cyclic ordering of split matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a long list of open questions rooted in the same underlying problem: understanding the structure of bases or common bases of matroids. These conjectures suggest that matroids may possess much stronger structural properties than are currently known. One example is related to cyclic orderings of matroids. A rank-$r$ matroid is called cyclically orderable if its ground set admits a cyclic ordering such that any interval of $r$ consecutive elements forms a basis. In this paper, we show that if the ground set of a split matroid decomposes into pairwise disjoint bases, then it is cyclically orderable. This result answers a conjecture of Kajitani, Ueno, and Miyano in a special case, and also strengthens Gabow's conjecture for this class of matroids. Our proof is algorithmic, hence it provides a procedure for determining a cyclic ordering in question using a polynomial number of independence oracle calls.</description>

      <title>Chromatic polynomial and the $\mathfrak{so}$ weight system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper by M.Kazarian and the second author, a recurrence for the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{so}(N)$ weight systems has been suggested; the recurrence allows one to construct the universal $\mathfrak{so}$ weight system. The construction is based on an extension of the $\mathfrak{so}$ weight systems to permutations. Another recent paper, by M. Kazarian, N. Kodaneva, and the first author, shows that under the substitution $C_m=xN^{m-1}, m=1,2,\dots,$ for the Casimir elements $C_m$, the leading term in $N$ of the value of the universal $\mathfrak{gl}$ weight system becomes the chromatic polynomial of the intersection graph of the chord diagram. In the present paper, we establish a similar result for the universal $\mathfrak{so}$ weight system. That is, we show that the leading term of the universal $\mathfrak{so}$ weight system also becomes the chromatic polynomial under a specific substitution.</description>

      <title>A tight upper bound of spectral radius in terms of degree deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The spectral radius $\rho(G)$ of $G$ is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $G$. As is well known, $\rho(G)\geq\frac{2m}{n}$ with equality if and only if $G$ is regular. To bound $\rho(G)-\frac{2m}{n}$, Nikiforov (2006) introduced the degree deviation of $G$ as $$s(G)=\sum_{1\leq i\leq n}|d_{i}-\frac{2m}{n}|,$$ where $d_{1},d_{2},\ldots,d_{n}$ are the degrees of the vertices of $G$. Nikiforov conjectured that $\rho(G)-\frac{2m}{n}\leq\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}s(G)}$ for sufficiently large $m$ and $n$. In this paper, we settle this conjecture without the assumption that $m$ and $n$ are large.</description>

      <title>Filling some gaps on the edge coloring problem of split graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. A connected graph $G$ is said to be $t$-admissible if admits a spanning tree in which the distance between any two adjacent vertices of $G$ is at most $t$. Given a graph $G$, determining the smallest $t$ for which $G$ is $t$-admissible, i.e., the stretch index of $G$ denoted by $\sigma(G)$, is the goal of the $t$-admissibility problem. Split graphs are $3$-admissible and can be partitioned into three subclasses: split graphs with $\sigma = 1$, $2$ or $3$. In this work we consider such a partition while dealing with the problem of coloring the edges of a split graph. Vizing proved that any graph can have its edges colored with $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$ colors, and thus can be classified as Class $1$ or Class $2$, respectively. The edge coloring problem is open for split graphs in general. In previous results, we classified split graphs with $\sigma = 2$ and in this paper we classify and provide an algorithm to color the edges of a subclass of split graphs with $\sigma = 3$.</description>

      <title>The Width of Hamming Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The width of a poset is the size of its largest antichain. Sperner's theorem states that $(2^{[n]},\subset)$ is a poset whose width equals the size of its largest layer. We show that Hamming ball posets also have this property. This extends earlier work that proves this in the case of small radii. Our proof is inspired by (and corrects) a result of Harper.</description>

      <title>Extremizing antiregular graphs by modifying total $\sigma$-irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total $\sigma$-irregularity is given by $
\sigma_t(G) = \sum_{\{u,v\} \subseteq V(G)} \left(d_G(u) - d_G(v)\right)^2, $
where $d_G(z)$ indicates the degree of a vertex $z$ within the graph $G$. It is known that the graphs maximizing $\sigma_{t}$-irregularity are split graphs with only a few distinct degrees. Since one might typically expect that graphs with as many distinct degrees as possible achieve maximum irregularity measures, we modify this invariant to $
\IR(G)= \sum_{\{u,v\} \subseteq V(G)} |d_G(u)-d_G(v)|^{f(n)}, $
where $n=|V(G)|$ and $f(n)&gt;0$. We study under what conditions the above modification obtains its maximum for antiregular graphs. We consider general graphs, trees, and chemical graphs, and accompany our results with a few problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>New arithmetic invariants for cospectral graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An invariant for cospectral graphs is a property shared by all cospectral graphs. In this paper, we present three new invariants for cospectral graphs, characterized by their arithmetic nature and apparent novelty. Specifically, let $G$ and $H$ be two graphs with adjacency matrices $A(G)$ and $A(H)$, respectively. We show, among other results, that if $G$ and $H$ are cospectral, then $e^{\rm T}A(G)^me\equiv e^{\rm T}A(H)^m e~({\rm mod}~4)$ for any integer $m\geq 0$, where $e$ is the all-one vector. As a simple consequence, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, every graph cospectral with $G$ is determined by its generalized spectrum.</description>

      <title>Independent Bondage Number of Graphs with Girth Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The independent domination number of a finite graph $G$ is defined as the minimum cardinality of an independent dominating set of vertices. The independent bondage number of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a set of edges whose deletion results in a graph with a larger independent domination number than that of $G$. There are currently no existing results on the independent bondage number of graphs with girth conditions. In this study, we establish upper bounds on the independent bondage number of graphs under specific girth conditions.</description>

      <title>Some conjectures on $r$-graphs and equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-regular graph is an $r$-graph, if every odd set of vertices is connected to its complement by at least $r$ edges. Seymour [On multicolourings of cubic graphs, and conjectures of Fulkerson and Tutte.~\emph{Proc.~London Math.~Soc.}~(3), 38(3): 423-460, 1979] conjectured (1) that every planar $r$-graph is $r$-edge colorable and (2) that every $r$-graph has $2r$ perfect matchings such that every edge is contained in precisely two of them. We study several variants of these conjectures.
  A $(t,r)$-PM is a multiset of $t \cdot r$ perfect matchings of an $r$-graph $G$ such that every edge is in precisely $t$ of them. We show that the following statements are equivalent for every $t, r \geq 1$:
  1. Every planar $r$-graph has a $(t,r)$-PM.
  2. Every $K_5$-minor-free $r$-graph has a $(t,r)$-PM.
  3. Every $K_{3,3}$-minor-free $r$-graph has a $(t,r)$-PM.
  4. Every $r$-graph whose underlying simple graph has crossing number at most $1$ has a $(t,r)$-PM.</description>

      <title>The Tur\'an Density of 4-Uniform Tight Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any uniformity $r$ and residue $k$ modulo $r$, we give an exact characterization of the $r$-uniform hypergraphs that homomorphically avoid tight cycles of length $k$ modulo $r$, in terms of colorings of $(r-1)$-tuples of vertices. This generalizes the result that a graph avoids all odd closed walks if and only if it is bipartite, as well as a result of Kam\v cev, Letzter, and Pokrovskiy in uniformity 3. In fact, our characterization applies to a much larger class of families than those of the form $\mathscr C_k^{(r)}=\{\text{$r$-uniform tight cycles of length $k$ modulo $r$}\}$.
  We also outline a general strategy to prove that, if $\mathscr C$ is a family of tight-cycle-like hypergraphs (including but not limited to the families $\mathscr C_k^{(r)}$) for which the above characterization applies, then all sufficiently long $C\in \mathscr C$ will have the same Tur\'an density. We demonstrate an application of this framework, proving that there exists an integer $L_0$ such that for every $L&gt;L_0$ not divisible by 4, the tight cycle $C^{(4)}_L$ has Tur\'an density $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Extremal spectral radius and $g$-good $r$-component connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $F\subseteq V(G)$, if $G-F$ is a disconnected graph with at least $r$ components and each vertex $v\in V(G)\backslash F$ has at least $g$ neighbors, then $F$ is called a $g$-good $r$-component cut of $G$. The $g$-good $r$-component connectivity of $G$, denoted by $c\kappa_{g,r}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of $g$-good $r$-component cuts of $G$. Let $\mathcal{G}_n^{k,\delta}$ be the set of graphs of order $n$ with minimum degree $\delta$ and $g$-good $r$-component connectivity $c\kappa_{g,r}(G)=k$. In the paper, we determine the extremal graphs attaining the maximum spectral radii among all graphs in $\mathcal{G}_n^{k,\delta}$. A subset $F\subseteq V(G)$ is called a $g$-good neighbor cut of $G$ if $G-F$ is disconnected and each vertex $v\in V(G)\backslash F$ has at least $g$ neighbors. The $g$-good neighbor connectivity $\kappa_g(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum cardinality of $g$-good neighbor cuts of $G$. The condition of $g$-good neighbor connectivity is weaker than that of $g$-good $r$-component connectivity, and there is no requirement on the number of components. As a counterpart, we also study similar problem for $g$-good neighbor connectivity.</description>

      <title>Periodic colorings and orientations in infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of periodic colorings and orientations in locally finite graphs. A coloring or orientation of a graph $G$ is periodic if the resulting colored or oriented graph is quasi-transitive, meaning that $V(G)$ has finitely many orbits under the action of the group of automorphisms of $G$ preserving the coloring or the orientation. When such a periodic coloring or orientation of $G$ exists, $G$ itself must be quasi-transitive and it is natural to investigate when quasi-transitive graphs have such periodic colorings or orientations. We provide examples of Cayley graphs with no periodic orientation or non-trivial coloring, and examples of quasi-transitive graphs of treewidth 2 without periodic orientation or proper coloring. On the other hand we show that every quasi-transitive graph $G$ of bounded pathwidth has a periodic proper coloring with $\chi(G)$ colors and a periodic orientation. We relate these problems with techniques and questions from symbolic dynamics and distributed computing and conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

      <title>The 2-burning number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time model for the spread of information in a graph, motivated by the idea that people believe a story when they learn of it from two different origins. Similar to the burning number, in this problem, information spreads in rounds and a new source can appear in each round. For a graph $G$, we are interested in $b_2(G)$, the minimum number of rounds until the information has spread to all vertices of graph $G$. We are also interested in finding $t_2(G)$, the minimum number of sources necessary so that the information spreads to all vertices of $G$ in $b_2(G)$ rounds. In addition to general results, we find $b_2(G)$ and $t_2(G)$ for the classes of spiders and wheels and show that their behavior differs with respect to these two parameters. We also provide examples and prove upper bounds
  for these parameters for Cartesian products of graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give identities for the voltage and resistance functions on a metrized graph to show how these functions behave under any edge deletion/contraction and the identification of any two vertices. This leads to explicit versions of Rayleigh's Principles on a resistive electrical network. We also establish Euler's Identities for the resistance and the voltage functions on an electrical network. One can use these results to study various invariants of metrized graphs and electrical networks. As a specific application, we obtain various identities for the total number of spanning trees of a graph. For example, we show how the total number of spanning trees changes under graph operations such as, contraction of an edge, deletion of an edge, deletion of a vertex, the join of arbitrary two or three vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex coloring $\varphi$ of a graph $G$ is $p$-centered if for every connected subgraph $H$ of $G$, either $\varphi$ uses more than $p$ colors on $H$, or there is a color that appears exactly once on $H$. We prove that for every fixed positive integer $t$, every $K_t$-minor-free graph admits a $p$-centered coloring using $\mathcal{O}(p^{t-1})$ colors.</description>

      <title>Facet-Hamiltonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider facet-Hamiltonian cycles of polytopes, defined as cycles in their skeleton such that every facet is visited exactly once. These cycles can be understood as optimal watchman routes that guard the facets of a polytope. We consider the existence of such cycles for a variety of polytopes, the facets of which have a natural combinatorial interpretation. In particular, we prove the following results:
  - Every permutahedron has a facet-Hamiltonian cycle. These cycles consist of circular sequences of permutations of $n$ elements, where two successive permutations differ by a single adjacent transposition, and such that every subset of $[n]$ appears as a prefix in a contiguous subsequence. With these cycles we associate what we call rhombic strips which encode interleaved Gray codes of the Boolean lattice, one Gray code for each rank. These rhombic strips correspond to simple Venn diagrams.
  - Every generalized associahedron has a facet-Hamiltonian cycle. This generalizes the so-called rainbow cycles of Felsner, Kleist, M\"utze, and Sering (SIDMA 2020) to associahedra of any finite type. We relate the constructions to the Conway-Coxeter friezes and the bipartite belts of finite type cluster algebras.
  - Graph associahedra of wheels, fans, and complete split graphs have facet-Hamiltonian cycles. For associahedra of complete bipartite graphs and caterpillars, we construct facet-Hamiltonian paths. The construction involves new insights on the combinatorics of graph tubings.
  We also consider the computational complexity of deciding whether a given polytope has a facet-Hamiltonian cycle and show that the problem is NP-complete, even when restricted to simple 3-dimensional polytopes.</description>

      <title>Matroid products via submodular coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of matroid products traces back to the 1970s, when Lov\'asz and Mason studied the existence of various types of matroid products with different strengths. Among these, the tensor product is arguably the most important, which can be considered as an extension of the tensor product from linear algebra. However, Las Vergnas showed that the tensor product of two matroids does not always exist. Over the following four decades, matroid products remained surprisingly underexplored, regaining attention only in recent years due to applications in tropical geometry and the limit theory of matroids.
  In this paper, inspired by the concept of coupling in probability theory, we introduce the notion of coupling for matroids -- or, more generally, for submodular set functions. This operation can be viewed as a relaxation of the tensor product. Unlike the tensor product, however, we prove that a coupling always exists for any two submodular functions and can be chosen to be increasing if the original functions are increasing. As a corollary, we show that two matroids always admit a matroid coupling, leading to a novel operation on matroids. Our construction is algorithmic, providing an oracle for the coupling matroid through a polynomial number of oracle calls to the original matroids.
  We apply this construction to derive new necessary conditions for matroid representability and establish connection between tensor products and Ingleton's inequality. Additionally, we verify the existence of set functions that are universal with respect to a given property, meaning any set function over a finite domain with that property can be obtained as a quotient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many (if not most) of convex polytopes, important for combinatorial and algebraic geometry, are closely related to secondary polytopes of point configurations, or base polytopes of submodular functions, or their numerous variations and generalizations.
  The aim of this text is to introduce the class of basecondary polytopes. This class includes (and allows to study uniformly) the aforementioned ones, as well as some others, e.g. appearing as Newton polytopes of important discriminant hypersurfaces.
  Most notably, this includes the discriminant of the Lyashko--Looijenga map, which is important for enumerative geometry of ramified coverings and cannot be reduced (by far) to Gelfand--Kapranov--Zelevinsky's A-discriminants and secondary polytopes.</description>

      <title>On the unimodality of nearly well-dominated trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polynomial is said to be unimodal if its coefficients are non-decreasing and then non-increasing. The domination polynomial of a graph $G$ is the generating function of the number of dominating sets of each cardinality in $G$. In \cite{IntroDomPoly2014} Alikhani and Peng conjectured that all domination polynomials are unimodal. In this paper we show that not all trees have log-concave domination polynomial. We also give non-increasing and non-decreasing segments of coefficents in trees. This allows us to show the domination polynomial trees with $\Gamma(T)-\gamma(T)&lt;3$ are unimodal.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration graphs for minimal domination sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dominating set $S$ in a graph is a subset of vertices such that every vertex is either in $S$ or adjacent to a vertex in $S$. A minimal dominating set $M$ is a dominating set such that $M-v$ is not a dominating set for all $v \in M$. In this paper we introduce a reconfiguration graph $\mathcal{R}(G)$ for minimal dominating sets under a generalization of the token sliding model. We give some preliminary results which include showing that $\mathcal{R}(G)$ is connected for trees and split graphs. Additionally we classify all graphs which have $\mathcal{R}(G) = K_n$ and $\mathcal{R}(G) = \overline{K_n}$ for all $n$.</description>

      <title>Repeated Lefschetz-like decompositions for flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complexes and gamma vectors of flag spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find decompositions of $h$-polynomials of flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complex that yield a direct connection between gamma vectors of flag spheres and constructions used to build them geometrically. More specifically, they are determined by iterated double suspensions and a ``net nonnegative set of edge subdivisions'' taking it to the given flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complex. By a ``net nonnegative set of edge subdivision'', we mean a collection of edge subdivisions and contractions where there are at least as many edge subdivisions as contractions.
  Returning to the flag spheres, these repeated decompositions involve links over collections of disjoint edges and give an analogue of a Lefschetz map that applies to each step of the decomposition. The constructions used also give a direct interpretation of the Boolean decompositions coming from links and those of the entire simplicial complex. Roughly speaking, the Boolean vs. non-Boolean distinction is used to measure how far a flag sphere is from being the boundary of a cross polytope. An analogue of this statement for flag doubly Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complexes would replace boundaries of cross polytopes by repeated suspensions of links over edges of the given simplicial complex.</description>

  Additionally, we present a direct method by which our analysis of the magic square system may be used to show the existence of magic squares consisting of distinct $k$ th powers when

      <title>The Gap Between Greedy Algorithm and Minimum Multiplicative Spanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The greedy algorithm adapted from Kruskal's algorithm is an efficient and folklore way to produce a $k$-spanner with girth at least $k+2$. The greedy algorithm has shown to be `existentially optimal', while it's not `universally optimal' for any constant $k$. Here, `universal optimality' means an algorithm can produce the smallest $k$-spanner $H$ given any $n$-vertex input graph $G$.
  However, how well the greedy algorithm works compared to `universal optimality' is still unclear for superconstant $k:=k(n)$. In this paper, we aim to give a new and fine-grained analysis of this problem in undirected unweighted graph setting. Specifically, we show some bounds on this problem including the following two
  (1) On the negative side, when $k&lt;\frac{1}{3}n-O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is not `universally optimal'.
  (2) On the positive side, when $k&gt;\frac{2}{3}n+O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is `universally optimal'.
  We also introduce an appropriate notion for `approximately universal optimality'. An algorithm is $(\alpha,\beta)$-universally optimal iff given any $n$-vertex input graph $G$, it can produce a $k$-spanner $H$ of $G$ with size $|H|\leq n+\alpha(|H^*|-n)+\beta$, where $H^*$ is the smallest $k$-spanner of $G$. We show the following positive bounds.
  (1) When $k&gt;\frac{4}{7}n+O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is $(2,O(1))$-universally optimal.
  (2) When $k&gt;\frac{12}{23}n+O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is $(18,O(1))$-universally optimal.
  (3) When $k&gt;\frac{1}{2}n+O(1)$, the greedy algorithm is $(32,O(1))$-universally optimal.
  All our proofs are constructive building on new structural analysis on spanners. We give some ideas about how to break small cycles in a spanner to increase the girth. These ideas may help us to understand the relation between girth and spanners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: N. G. de Bruijn (1958) studied the asymptotic expansion of iterates of sin$(x)$ with $0 &lt; x \leq \pi/2$. Bencherif &amp; Robin (1994) generalized this result to increasing analytic functions $f(x)$ with an attractive fixed point at 0 and $x &gt; 0$ suitably small. Mavecha &amp; Laohakosol (2013) formulated an algorithm for explicitly deriving required parameters. We review their method, testing it initally on the logistic function $\ell(x)$, a certain radical function $r(x)$, and later on several transcendental functions. Along the way, we show how $\ell(x)$ and $r(x)$ are kindred functions; the same is also true for sin$(x)$ and arcsinh$(x)$.</description>

      <title>Closing the complexity gap of the double distance problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement has been an active area of research in computational comparative genomics for the last three decades. While initially mostly an interesting algorithmic endeavor, now the practical application by applying rearrangement distance methods and more advanced phylogenetic tasks is becoming common practice, given the availability of many completely sequenced genomes. Several genome rearrangement models have been developed over time, sometimes with surprising computational properties. A prominent example is the fact that computing the reversal distance of two signed permutations is possible in linear time, while for two unsigned permutations it is NP-hard. Therefore one has always to be careful about the precise problem formulation and complexity analysis of rearrangement problems in order not to be fooled. The double distance is the minimum number of genomic rearrangements between a singular and a duplicated genome that, in addition to rearrangements, are separated by a whole genome duplication. At the same time it allows to assign the genes of the duplicated genome to the two paralogous chromosome copies that existed right after the duplication event. Computing the double distance is another example of a tricky hardness landscape: If the distance measure underlying the double distance is the simple breakpoint distance, the problem can be solved in linear time, while with the more elaborate DCJ distance it is NP-hard. Indeed, there is a family of distance measures, parameterized by an even number k, between the breakpoint distance (k=2) and the DCJ distance (k=\infty). Little was known about the hardness border between these extremes; the problem complexity was known only for k=4 and k=6. In this paper, we close the gap, providing a full picture of the hardness landscape when computing the double distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01836v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the shortest $s$-$t$ path problem has the overlap-gap property in (i) sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs and (ii) complete graphs with i.i.d. Exponential edge weights. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in sparse $\mathbf{G}(n,p)$ graphs, shortest path is solved by $O(\log n)$-degree polynomial estimators, and a uniform approximate shortest path can be sampled in polynomial time. This constitutes the first example in which the overlap-gap property is not predictive of algorithmic intractability for a (non-algebraic) average-case optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Parks: A Doubly Infinite Family of NP-Complete Puzzles and Generalizations of A002464</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parks Puzzle is a paper-and-pencil puzzle game that is classically played on a square grid with different colored regions (the parks). The player needs to place a certain number of "trees" in each row, column, and park such that none are adjacent, even diagonally. We define a doubly-infinite family of such puzzles, the $(c, r)$-tree Parks puzzles, where there need be $c$ trees per column and $r$ per row. We then prove that for each $c$ and $r$ the set of $(c, r)$-tree puzzles is NP-complete. For each $c$ and $r$, there is a sequence of possible board sizes $m \times n$, and the number of possible puzzle solutions for these board sizes is a doubly-infinite generalization of OEIS sequence A002464, which itself describes the case $c = r = 1$. This connects the Parks puzzle to chess-based puzzle problems, as the sequence describes the number of ways to place non-attacking kings on a chessboard so that there is exactly one in each column and row (i.e. to place non-attacking dragon kings in shogi). These findings add yet another puzzle to the set of chess puzzles and expands the list of known NP-complete problems described.</description>

Abstract: The shuffle of a non-empty countable set $ S $ of linear orders is the (unique up to isomorphism) linear order $ \Xi(S) $ obtained by fixing a coloring function $ \chi: \mathbb{Q} \to S $ having fibers dense in $ \mathbb{Q} $ and replacing each rational $ q $ in $ (\mathbb{Q}, &lt;) $ with an isomorphic copy of $ \chi(q) $. We prove that any two countable shuffles that embed as convex subsets into each other are order isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial G\"ottsche-Schroeter invariants in any genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G\"ottsche-Schroeter invariants are a genus 0 extension of Block-G\"ottsche invariants. They interpolate between Welschinger invariants involving pairs of complex conjugated points and genus 0 descendant Gromov-Witten invariants. They can be computed by a floor diagram algorithm.
  In this paper, we show that this floor diagrams recipe actually leads to some invariants in any genus. This generalizes G\"ottsche-Schroter invariant in higher genus in a combinatorial way. We then prove some polynomiality result and establish a link with invariants defined by Shustin and Sinichkin. We provide many examples. In particular, we conjecture that these combinatorial invariants satisfy the Abramovich-Bertram formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13799v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define noncrossing partitions of a marked surface without punctures (interior marked points). We show that the natural partial order on noncrossing partitions is a graded lattice and describe its rank function topologically. Lower intervals in the lattice are isomorphic to products of noncrossing partition lattices of other surfaces. We similarly define noncrossing partitions of a symmetric marked surface with double points and prove some of the analogous results. The combination of symmetry and double points plays a role that one might have expected to be played by punctures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The noncrossing partition poset associated to a Coxeter group $W$ and Coxeter element $c$ is the interval $[1,c]_T$ in the absolute order on $W$. We construct a new model of noncrossing partititions for $W$ of classical affine type, using planar diagrams (affine types $\tilde A$ and $\tilde C$ in this paper and affine types $\tilde D$ and $\tilde B$ in the sequel). The model in type $\tilde A$ consists of noncrossing partitions of an annulus. In type $\tilde C$, the model consists of symmetric noncrossing partitions of an annulus or noncrossing partitions of a disk with two orbifold points. Following the lead of McCammond and Sulway, we complete $[1,c]_T$ to a lattice by factoring the translations in $[1,c]_T$, but the combinatorics of the planar diagrams leads us to make different choices about how to factor.</description>

      <title>Components of domino tilings under flips in quadriculated tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a region R consisting of unit squares, a (domino) tiling is a collection of dominoes (the union of two adjacent squares) which pave fully the region. The flip graph of R is defined on the set of all tilings of R where two tilings are adjacent if we change one from the other by a flip (a 90-degree rotation of a pair of side-by-side dominoes). If R is simply-connected, then its flip graph is connected. By using homology and cohomology, Saldanha, Tomei, Casarin and Romualdo obtained a criterion to decide if two tilings are in the same component of flip graph of quadriculated surface. By a graph-theoretic method, we obtain that the flip graph of a non-bipartite quadriculated torus consists of two isomorphic components. As an application, we obtain that the forcing numbers of all perfect matchings of each non-bipartite quadriculated torus form an integer-interval. For a bipartite quadriculated torus, the components of the flip graph is more complicated, and we use homology to obtain a general lower bound for the number of components of its flip graph.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of self-overlapping permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the concept of self-overlapping permutations, which is related to the larger study of consecutive patterns in permutations. We show that this concept admits a simple and clear geometrical meaning, and prove that a permutation can be represented as a sequence of non-self-overlapping ones. The above structural decomposition allows us to obtain equations for the corresponding generating functions, as well as the complete asymptotic expansions for the probability that a large random permutation is (non-)self-overlapping. In particular, we show that almost all permutations are non-self-overlapping, and that the corresponding asymptotic expansion has the self-reference property: the involved coefficients count non-self-overlapping permutations once again. We also establish complete asymptotic expansions of the distributions of very tight non-self-overlapping patterns, and discuss the similarities of the non-self-overlapping permutations to other permutation building blocks, such as indecomposable and simple permutations, as well as their associated asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Categories of impartial rulegraphs and gamegraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional mathematical model for an impartial combinatorial game is defined recursively as a set of the options of the game, where the options are games themselves. We propose a model called gamegraph, together with its generalization rulegraph, based on the natural description of a game as a digraph where the vertices are positions and the arrows represent possible moves. Such digraphs form a category where the morphisms are option preserving maps. We study several versions of this category. Our development includes congruence relations, quotients, and isomorphism theorems and is analogous to the corresponding notions in universal algebra. The quotient by the maximum congruence relation produces an object that is essentially equivalent to the traditional model. After the development of the general theory, we count the number of non-isomorphic gamegraphs and rulegraphs by formal birthday and the number of positions.</description>

      <title>Total positivity and two inequalities by Athanasiadis and Tzanaki</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ be a $(d-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex and $h^ \Delta = (h_0^ \Delta ,\ldots, h_d^ \Delta)$ its $h$-vector. For a face uniform subdivision operation ${\mathcal F}$ we write $\Delta_{\mathcal F}$ for the subdivided complex and $H_{\mathcal F}$ for the matrix such that $h^ {\Delta_{\mathcal F}} = H_{\mathcal F} h^ \Delta$.
  In connection with the real rootedness of symmetric decompositions Athanasiadis and Tzanaki studied for strictly positive $h$-vectors the inequalities $\frac{h_0^ \Delta}{h_1^ \Delta} \leq \frac{h_1^\Delta}{h_{d-1}^ \Delta} \leq \cdots \leq \frac{h_d^ \Delta}{h_0^\Delta}$ and $\frac{h_1^\Delta}{h_{d-1}^\Delta} \geq \cdots \geq \frac{h_{d-2}^\Delta}{h_2^\Delta} \geq \frac{h_{d-1}^\Delta}{h_1^\Delta}$. In this paper we show that if the inequalities holds for a simplicial complex $\Delta$ and $H_{\mathcal F}$ is TP$_2$ (all entries and two minors are non-negative) then the inequalities hold for $\Delta_{\mathcal F}$.
  We prove that if ${\mathcal F}$ is the barycentric subdivision then $H_{\mathcal F}$ is TP$_2$. If ${\mathcal F}$ is the $r$\textsuperscript{th}-edgewise subdivision then work of Diaconis and Fulman shows $H_{\mathcal F}$ is TP$_2$. Indeed in this case by work of Mao and Wang $H_{\mathcal F}$ is even TP.</description>

      <title>The $e$-positivity of the chromatic symmetric function for twinned paths and cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of twinning a graph at a vertex was introduced by Foley, Ho\`ang, and Merkel (2019), who conjectured that twinning preserves $e$-positivity of the chromatic symmetric function. A counterexample to this conjecture was given by Li, Li, Wang, and Yang (2021). In this paper, we prove that $e$-positivity is preserved by the twinning operation on cycles, by giving an $e$-positive generating function for the chromatic symmetric function, as well as an $e$-positive recurrence. We derive similar $e$-positive generating functions and recurrences for twins of paths. Our methods make use of the important triple deletion formulas of Orellana and Scott (2014), as well as new symmetric function identities.</description>

Abstract: Woodall (and Seymour independently) in 2001 proposed a conjecture that every graph $G$ contains every complete bipartite graph on $\chi(G)$ vertices as a minor, where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number of $G$. In this paper, we prove that for each positive integer $\ell$ with $2\ell \leq \chi(G)$, each graph $G$ with independence number two contains a $K^{\ell}_{\ell,\chi(G)-\ell}$-minor, implying that Seymour and Woodall's conjecture holds for graphs with independence number two, where $K^{\ell}_{\ell,\chi(G)-\ell}$ is the graph obtained from $K_{\ell,\chi(G)-\ell}$ by making every pair of vertices on the side of the bipartition of size $\ell$ adjacent.</description>

      <title>Multilevel polynomial partitioning and semialgebraic hypergraphs: regularity, Tur\'an, and Zarankiewicz results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove three main results about semialgebraic hypergraphs. First, we prove an optimal and oblivious regularity lemma. Fox, Pach, and Suk proved that the class of $k$-uniform semialgebraic hypergraphs satisfies a very strong regularity lemma where the vertex set can be partitioned into $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ parts so that all but an $\varepsilon$-fraction of $k$-tuples of parts are homogeneous (either complete or empty). Our result improves the number of parts in the partition to $O_{d,k}((D/\varepsilon)^{d})$ where $d$ is the dimension of the ambient space and $D$ is a measure of the complexity of the hypergraph; additionally, the partition is oblivious to the edge set of the hypergraph. We give examples that show that the dependence on both $\varepsilon$ and $D$ is optimal.
  From this regularity lemma we deduce the best-known Tur\'an-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. Third, we prove a Zarankiewicz-type result for semialgebraic hypergraphs. Previously Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl showed that a $K_{u,u}$-free semialgebraic graph on $N$ vertices has at most $O_{d,D,u}(N^{2d/(d+1)+o(1)})$ edges and Do extended this result to $K_{u,\ldots,u}^{(k)}$-free semialgebraic hypergraphs. We improve upon both of these results by removing the $o(1)$ in the exponent and making the dependence on $D$ and $u$ explicit and polynomial.
  All three of these results follow from a novel ``multilevel polynomial partitioning scheme'' that efficiently partitions a point set $P\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ via low-complexity semialgebraic pieces. We prove this result using the polynomial method over varieties as developed by Walsh which extends the real polynomial partitioning technique of Guth and Katz.
  We give additional applications to the unit distance problem, the Erd\H{o}s--Hajnal problem for semialgebraic graphs, and property testing of semialgebraic hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and let $d_G$ be the geodesic distance on $V(G)$. The metric spaces $(V(G), d_{G})$ are characterized up to isometry for all finite connected $G$ by David C. Kay and Gary Chartrand in 1964. The main result of the paper expands this characterization on the infinite connected graphs. We also prove that every metric space with integer distances between its points admits an isometric embedding into $(V(G), d_G)$ for suitable $G$.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the stability of tensor ranks under field extensions. Our main contributions are fourfold: (1) We prove that the analytic rank is stable under field extensions. (2) We establish the equivalence between the partition rank vs. analytic rank conjecture and the stability conjecture for partition rank. We also prove that they are equivalent to other two important conjectures. (3) We resolve the Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler conjecture on the stability of the slice rank of linear subspaces under field extensions. (4) As an application of (1), we show that the geometric rank is equal to the analytic rank up to a constant factor.</description>

Abstract: The existence of Hamiltonian cycles in 1-planar graphs with higher connectivity has attracted considerable attention. Recently, the authors and Dong proved that 4-connected 1-planar chordal graphs are Hamiltonian-connected. In this paper, we investigate the non-Hamiltonicity of a broader class of graphs, specifically perfect graphs, under the constraint of 1-planarity, with a focus on connectivity of at most 5. We also propose some unsolved problems.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of finite groups through (basic) algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.02774v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to representation theory of finite groups that uses some basic algebraic geometry and allows to do all the theory without using characters. With this approach, to any finite group $G$ we associate a finite number of points and show that any field containing the coordinates of those points works fine as the ground field for the representations of $G$. We apply this point of view to the symmetric group $S_d$, finding easy equations for the different symmetries of functions in $d$ variables. As a byproduct, we give an easy proof of a recent result by Tocino that states that the hyperdeterminant of a $d$-dimensional matrix is zero for all but two types of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Subgroup growth in free class-$2$-nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an effective procedure to compute the local subgroup zeta functions of the free class-$2$-nilpotent groups on $d$ generators, for all $d$. For $d=4$, this yields a new, explicit formula. For $d\in\{4,5\}$, we compute the topological subgroup zeta function. We also obtain general results about the reduced and topological subalgebra zeta functions. For the former, we determine the behaviour at one and for the latter, the degree and behaviours at zero and infinity. Some of these results confirm, in the relevant special cases, general conjectures by T. Rossmann.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study some natural operators acting on configurations of points and lines in the plane and remark that many interesting configurations are fixed points for these operators. We review ancient and recent results on line or point arrangements though the realm of these operators. We study the first dynamical properties of the iteration of these operators on some line arrangements.</description>

      <title>Bohr recurrence and density of non-lacunary semigroups of $\mathbb{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $R$ of integers is a set of Bohr recurrence if every rotation on $\mathbb{T}^d$ returns arbitrarily close to zero under some non-zero multiple of $R$. We show that the set $\{k!\, 2^m3^n\colon k,m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a set of Bohr recurrence. This is a particular case of a more general statement about images of such sets under any integer polynomial with zero constant term. We also show that if $P$ is a real polynomial with at least one non-constant irrational coefficient, then the set $\{P(2^m3^n)\colon m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is dense in $\mathbb{T}$, thus providing a joint generalization of two well-known results, one of Furstenberg and one of Weyl.</description>

      <title>CWR sequence of invariants of alternating links and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the $CWR$ invariant, a new invariant for alternating links, which builds upon and generalizes the $WRP$ invariant. The $CWR$ invariant is an array of two-variable polynomials that provides a stronger invariant compared to the $WRP$ invariant. We compare the strength of our invariant with the classical HOMFLYPT, Kauffman $3$-variable, and Kauffman $2$-variable polynomials on specific knot examples. Additionally, we derive general recursive "skein" relations, and also specific formulas for the initial components of the $CWR$ invariant using weighted adjacency matrices of modified Tait graphs.</description>

      <title>Palette Sparsification for Graphs with Sparse Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seminal palette sparsification result of Assadi, Chen, and Khanna states that in every $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $\Delta$, sampling $\Theta(\log n)$ colors per vertex from $\{1, \ldots, \Delta+1\}$ almost certainly allows for a proper coloring from the sampled colors. Alon and Assadi extended this work proving a similar result for $O\left(\Delta/\log \Delta\right)$-coloring triangle-free graphs. Apart from being interesting results from a combinatorial standpoint, their results have various applications to the design of graph coloring algorithms in different models of computation. In this work, we focus on locally sparse graphs, i.e., graphs with sparse neighborhoods. We say a graph $G = (V, E)$ is $k$-locally-sparse if for each vertex $v \in V$, the subgraph $G[N(v)]$ contains at most $k$ edges. A celebrated result of Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov shows that such graphs are $O(\Delta/\log (\Delta/\sqrt{k}))$-colorable. For any $\alpha \in (0, 1)$ and $k \ll \Delta^{2\alpha}$, let $G$ be a $k$-locally-sparse graph. For $q = \Theta\left(\Delta/\log \left(\Delta^\alpha/\sqrt{k}\right)\right)$, we show that sampling $O\left(\Delta^\alpha + \sqrt{\log n}\right)$ colors per vertex is sufficient to obtain a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ from the sampled colors. Setting $k = 1$ recovers the aforementioned result of Alon and Assadi for triangle-free graphs. A key element in our proof is a proposition regarding correspondence coloring in the so-called color-degree setting, which improves upon recent work of Anderson, Kuchukova, and the author and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Constant congestion linkages in polynomially strong digraphs in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given integers $k,c &gt; 0$, we say that a digraph $D$ is $(k,c)$-linked if for every pair of ordered sets $\{s_1, \ldots, s_k\}$ and $\{t_1, \ldots, t_k\}$ of vertices of $D$, there are $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ such that for $i \in [k]$ each $P_i$ is a path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ and every vertex of $D$ appears in at most $c$ of those paths. Thomassen [Combinatorica, 1991] showed that for every fixed $k \geq 2$ there is no integer $p$ such that every $p$-strong digraph is $(k,1)$-linked. Edwards et al. [ESA, 2017] showed that every digraph $D$ with directed treewidth at least some function $f(k)$ contains a large bramble of congestion $2$ and that every $(36k^3 + 2k)$-strong digraph containing a bramble of congestion $2$ and size roughly $188k^3$ is $(k,2)$-linked. Since the directed treewidth of a digraph has to be at least its strong connectivity, this implies that there is a function $L(k)$ such that every $L(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,2)$-linked. This result was improved by Campos et al. [ESA, 2023], who showed that any $k$-strong digraph containing a bramble of size at least $2k(c\cdot k -c + 2) + c(k-1)$ and congestion $c$ is $(k,c)$-linked. Regarding the bramble, although the given bound on $f(k)$ is very large, Masa\v{r}\'ik et al. [SIDMA, 2022] showed that directed treewidth $\mathcal{O}(k^{48}\log^{13} k)$ suffices if the congestion is relaxed to $8$. We first show how to drop the dependence on $c$, for even $c$, on the size of the bramble that is needed in the work of Campos et al. [ESA, 2023]. Then, by making two local changes in the proof of Masa\v{r}\'ik et al. [SIDMA, 2022] we show how to build in polynomial time a bramble of size $k$ and congestion $8$ assuming that a large obstruction to directed treewidth (namely, a path system) is given. Applying these results, we show that there is a polynomial function $g(k)$ such that every $g(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,8)$-linked.</description>

      <title>Square-free powers of Cohen-Macaulay forests, cycles, and whiskered cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $I(G)^{[k]}$ denote the $k^{th}$ square-free power of the edge ideal $I(G)$ of a graph $G$. In this article, we provide a precise formula for the depth of $I(G)^{[k]}$ when $G$ is a Cohen-Macaulay forest. Using this, we show that for a Cohen-Macaulay forest $G$, the $k^{th}$ square-free power of $I(G)$ is always Cohen-Macaulay, which is quite surprising since all ordinary powers of $I(G)$ can never be Cohen-Macaulay unless $G$ is a disjoint union of edges. Next, we give an exact formula for the regularity and tight bounds on the depth of square-free powers of edge ideals of cycles. In the case of whiskered cycles, we obtain tight bounds on the regularity and depth of square-free powers, which aids in identifying when such ideals have linear resolutions. Additionally, we compute depth of $I(G)^{[2]}$ when $G$ is a cycle or whiskered cycle, and regularity of $I(G)^{[2]}$ when $G$ is a whiskered cycle.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via combinatorial expansion I: Perturbation of eigenspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. The key idea is to exploit the skewness between the leading eigenvectors of the ground matrix and the noise matrix. We will do this by combining the classical contour integration method with combinatorial ideas, resulting in a new machinery, which has a wide range of applications. Our new bounds are optimal under mild assumptions, with direct applications to central problems in many different areas. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new, optimal, results concerning covariance estimator of the spiked model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, and somewhat unexpectedly, we can use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <title>Cryptarithmically unique terms in integer sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cryptarithm (or alphametic) is a mathematical puzzle in which numbers are represented with words in such a way that identical letters stand for equal digits and distinct letters for unequal digits. An alphametic puzzle is usually given in the form of an equation that needs to be solved, such as SEND + MORE = MONEY. Alternatively, here we will consider cryptarithms constrained not by an equation but by a particular subsequence of natural numbers, for example perfect squares or primes. Such a cryptarithm has a unique solution if there is exactly one term in the sequence that has the corresponding pattern of digits. We will call such terms cryptarithmically unique. Here we estimate the density of such terms in an arbitrary sequence for which the overall density of terms among integers is known. In particular, among all perfect squares below 10^12, slightly less than one half are cryptarithmically unique, their density increasing toward larger numbers. Cryptarithmically unique prime numbers, however, are initially very scarce. Combinatorial estimates suggest that their density should drop below 10^-300 for decimal lengths of approximately 1829 digits, but then it recovers and is asymptotic to unity for very large primes. Finally, we introduce and discuss primonumerophobic digit patterns that no prime number happens to have.</description>
