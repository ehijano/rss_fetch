      <title>Minimal sized generating sets of permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a randomised variant of an algorithm of Lucchini and Thakkar for finding a smallest sized generating set in a finite group, which has polynomial time expected running time in finite permutation groups.</description>

      <title>Genus and crosscap of Normal subgroup based power graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$. The normal subgroup based power graph $\Gamma_H(G)$ of $G$ is the simple undirected graph with vertex set $V(\Gamma_H(G))= (G\setminus H)\cup \{e\}$ and two distinct vertices $a$ and $b$ are adjacent if either $aH = b^m H$ or $bH=a^nH$ for some $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. In this paper, we continue the study of normal subgroup based power graph and characterize all the pairs $(G,H)$, where $H$ is a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$, such that the genus of $\Gamma_H(G)$ is at most $2$. Moreover, we determine all the subgroups $H$ and the quotient groups $\frac{G}{H}$ such that the cross-cap of $\Gamma_H(G)$ is at most three.</description>

      <title>The category of partial group actions: quotients, (co)limits and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the category of partial actions, where the group and the set upon which the group acts can vary. Within this framework, we develop a theory of quotient partial actions and prove that this category is both (co)complete and encompasses the category of groupoids as a full subcategory.
  In particular, we establish the existence of a pair of adjoint functors, denoted as $\Phi : \textbf{Grpd} \to \textbf{ParAct}$ and $\Psi : \textbf{ParAct} \to \textbf{Grpd}$, with the property that $\Psi \Phi \cong 1_{\textbf{Grpd} }$.
  Next, for a given groupoid $\Gamma$, we provide a characterization of all partial actions that allow the recovery of the groupoid $\Gamma$ through $\Psi$. This characterization is expressed in terms of certain normal subgroups of a universal group constructed from $\Gamma.$
  Furthermore, we extend some of these results to the topological case, showing that topological groupoids can always be obtained from (weak) topological partial group action.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan Bigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their seminal paper, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak (LPS) defined the notion of regular Ramanujan graphs and gave an explicit construction of infinite families of $(p+1)$-regular Ramanujan Cayley graphs, for infinitely many $p$. In this paper we extend the work of LPS and its successors to bigraphs (biregular bipartite graphs), in several aspects: we investigate the combinatorial properties of various generalizations of the notion of Ramanujan graphs, define a notion of Cayley bigraphs, and give explicit constructions of infinite families of $(p^3+1,p+1)$-regular Ramanujan Cayley bigraphs, for infinitely many $p$.
  Both the LPS graphs and our ones are arithmetic, arising as quotients of Bruhat-Tits trees by congruence subgroups of arithmetic lattices in a $p$-adic group, $PGL_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for LPS and $PU_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for us. In both cases the Ramanujan property relates to the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture (GRC), on the respective groups. But while for $PGL_2$ the GRC holds unconditionally, this is not so in the case of $PU_3$. We find explicit cases where the GRC does and does not hold, and use this to construct arithmetic non-Ramanujan Cayley bigraphs as well, and prove that nevertheless they satisfy the Sarnak-Xue density hypothesis.
  On the combinatorial side, we present a pseudorandomness characterization of Ramanujan bigraphs, and a more general notion of biexpanders. We also show that the graphs we construct exhibit the cutoff phenomenon with bounded window size for the mixing time of non-backtracking random walks, either as a consequence of the Ramanujan property, or the density hypothesis. Finally, we present some other applications of our work: super golden gates for $PU_3$, Ramanujan and non-Ramanujan complexes of type $\tilde{A}_2$, optimal strong approximation for $p$-arithmetic subgroups of $PSU_3$ and vanishing of Betti numbers of Picard modular surfaces.</description>
