      <title>Directed Criteria Citation Recommendation and Ranking Through Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore link prediction as a proxy for automatically surfacing documents from existing literature that might be topically or contextually relevant to a new document. Our model uses transformer-based graph embeddings to encode the meaning of each document, presented as a node within a citation network. We show that the semantic representations that our model generates can outperform other content-based methods in recommendation and ranking tasks. This provides a holistic approach to exploring citation graphs in domains where it is critical that these documents properly cite each other, so as to minimize the possibility of any inconsistencies</description>

      <title>Graph Bayesian Optimization for Multiplex Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence maximization (IM) is the problem of identifying a limited number of initial influential users within a social network to maximize the number of influenced users. However, previous research has mostly focused on individual information propagation, neglecting the simultaneous and interactive dissemination of multiple information items. In reality, when users encounter a piece of information, such as a smartphone product, they often associate it with related products in their minds, such as earphones or computers from the same brand. Additionally, information platforms frequently recommend related content to users, amplifying this cascading effect and leading to multiplex influence diffusion.
  This paper first formulates the Multiplex Influence Maximization (Multi-IM) problem using multiplex diffusion models with an information association mechanism. In this problem, the seed set is a combination of influential users and information. To effectively manage the combinatorial complexity, we propose Graph Bayesian Optimization for Multi-IM (GBIM). The multiplex diffusion process is thoroughly investigated using a highly effective global kernelized attention message-passing module. This module, in conjunction with Bayesian linear regression (BLR), produces a scalable surrogate model. A data acquisition module incorporating the exploration-exploitation trade-off is developed to optimize the seed set further. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets have proven our proposed framework effective. The code is available at https://github.com/zirui-yuan/GBIM.</description>

      <title>A recommender network perspective on the informational value of critics and crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do the ratings of critics and amateurs compare and how should they be combined? Previous research has produced mixed results about the first question, while the second remains unanswered. We have created a new, unique dataset, with wine ratings from critics and amateurs, and simulated a recommender system using the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. We then formalized the advice seeking network spanned by that algorithm and studied people's relative influence. We find that critics are more consistent than amateurs, and thus their advice is more predictive than advice from amateurs. Getting advice from both groups can further boost performance. Our network theoretic approach allows us to identify influential critics, talented amateurs, and the information flow between groups. Our results provide evidence about the informational function of critics, while our framework is broadly applicable and can be leveraged to devise good decision strategies and more transparent recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Unsupervised Community Search with Pre-trained Graph Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community search has aroused widespread interest in the past decades. Among existing solutions, the learning-based models exhibit outstanding performance in terms of accuracy by leveraging labels to 1) train the model for community score learning, and 2) select the optimal threshold for community identification. However, labeled data are not always available in real-world scenarios. To address this notable limitation of learning-based models, we propose a pre-trained graph Transformer based community search framework that uses Zero label (i.e., unsupervised), termed TransZero. TransZero has two key phases, i.e., the offline pre-training phase and the online search phase. Specifically, in the offline pretraining phase, we design an efficient and effective community search graph transformer (CSGphormer) to learn node representation. To pre-train CSGphormer without the usage of labels, we introduce two self-supervised losses, i.e., personalization loss and link loss, motivated by the inherent uniqueness of node and graph topology, respectively. In the online search phase, with the representation learned by the pre-trained CSGphormer, we compute the community score without using labels by measuring the similarity of representations between the query nodes and the nodes in the graph. To free the framework from the usage of a label-based threshold, we define a new function named expected score gain to guide the community identification process. Furthermore, we propose two efficient and effective algorithms for the community identification process that run without the usage of labels. Extensive experiments over 10 public datasets illustrate the superior performance of TransZero regarding both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Neural Attributed Community Search at Billion Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community search has been extensively studied in the past decades. In recent years, there is a growing interest in attributed community search that aims to identify a community based on both the query nodes and query attributes. A set of techniques have been investigated. Though the recent methods based on advanced learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, we notice that 1) they suffer from severe efficiency issues; 2) they directly model community search as a node classification problem and thus cannot make good use of interdependence among different entities in the graph. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a new neurAL attrIbuted Community sEarch model for large-scale graphs, termed ALICE. ALICE first extracts a candidate subgraph to reduce the search scope and subsequently predicts the community by the Consistency-aware Net , termed ConNet. Specifically, in the extraction phase, we introduce the density sketch modularity that uses a unified form to combine the strengths of two existing powerful modularities, i.e., classical modularity and density modularity. Based on the new modularity metric, we first adaptively obtain the candidate subgraph, formed by the k-hop neighbors of the query nodes, with the maximum modularity. Then, we construct a node-attribute bipartite graph to take attributes into consideration. After that, ConNet adopts a cross-attention encoder to encode the interaction between the query and the graph. The training of the model is guided by the structure-attribute consistency and the local consistency to achieve better performance. Extensive experiments over 11 real-world datasets including one billion-scale graph demonstrate the superiority of ALICE in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.</description>

      <title>Simulating Relational Event Histories -- Why and How</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many important social phenomena result from repeated interactions among individuals over time such as email exchanges in an organization, or face-to-face interactions in a classroom. Insights into the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of these interactions can be achieved through simulations of networks on a fine temporal granularity. In this paper, we present statistical frameworks to simulate relational event networks under dyadic and actor-oriented relational event models. These simulators have a broad applicability in temporal social network research such as model fit assessment, theory building, network intervention planning, making predictions, understanding the impact of network structures, to name a few. We show this in three extensive applications. First, it is shown why simulation-based techniques are crucial for relational event model assessment, for example to investigate how past events affect future interactions in the network. Second, we demonstrate how simulation techniques contribute to a better understanding of the longevity of network interventions. Third, we show how simulation techniques are important when building and extending theories about social phenomena such as understanding social identity dynamics using optimal distinctiveness theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the communication styles and structures of Twitter (X) communities within the vaccination context. While mainstream research primarily focuses on the echo-chamber phenomenon, wherein certain ideas are reinforced and participants are isolated from opposing opinions, this study reveals the presence of diverse communication styles across various communities. In addition to the communities exhibiting echo-chamber behavior, this research uncovers communities with distinct communication patterns. By shedding light on the nuanced nature of communication within social networks, this study emphasizes the significance of understanding the diversity of perspectives within online communities.</description>

      <title>Moderating Illicit Online Image Promotion for Unsafe User-Generated Content Games Using Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online user-generated content games (UGCGs) are increasingly popular among children and adolescents for social interaction and more creative online entertainment. However, they pose a heightened risk of exposure to explicit content, raising growing concerns for the online safety of children and adolescents. Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed the issue of illicit image-based promotions of unsafe UGCGs on social media, which can inadvertently attract young users. This challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining comprehensive training data for UGCG images and the unique nature of these images, which differ from traditional unsafe content. In this work, we take the first step towards studying the threat of illicit promotions of unsafe UGCGs. We collect a real-world dataset comprising 2,924 images that display diverse sexually explicit and violent content used to promote UGCGs by their game creators. Our in-depth studies reveal a new understanding of this problem and the urgent need for automatically flagging illicit UGCG promotions. We additionally create a cutting-edge system, UGCG-Guard, designed to aid social media platforms in effectively identifying images used for illicit UGCG promotions. This system leverages recently introduced large vision-language models (VLMs) and employs a novel conditional prompting strategy for zero-shot domain adaptation, along with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for contextual identification. UGCG-Guard achieves outstanding results, with an accuracy rate of 94% in detecting these images used for the illicit promotion of such games in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>MPXGAT: An Attention based Deep Learning Model for Multiplex Graphs Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has rapidly emerged as a pivotal field of study. Despite its growing popularity, the majority of research has been confined to embedding single-layer graphs, which fall short in representing complex systems with multifaceted relationships. To bridge this gap, we introduce MPXGAT, an innovative attention-based deep learning model tailored to multiplex graph embedding. Leveraging the robustness of Graph Attention Networks (GATs), MPXGAT captures the structure of multiplex networks by harnessing both intra-layer and inter-layer connections. This exploitation facilitates accurate link prediction within and across the network's multiple layers. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation, conducted on various benchmark datasets, confirms that MPXGAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation on Stochastic Blockmodels for Directed Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the directed graph clustering problem through the lens of statistics, where we formulate clustering as estimating underlying communities in the directed stochastic block model (DSBM). We conduct the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) on the DSBM and thereby ascertain the most probable community assignment given the observed graph structure. In addition to the statistical point of view, we further establish the equivalence between this MLE formulation and a novel flow optimization heuristic, which jointly considers two important directed graph statistics: edge density and edge orientation. Building on this new formulation of directed clustering, we introduce two efficient and interpretable directed clustering algorithms, a spectral clustering algorithm and a semidefinite programming based clustering algorithm. We provide a theoretical upper bound on the number of misclustered vertices of the spectral clustering algorithm using tools from matrix perturbation theory. We compare, both quantitatively and qualitatively, our proposed algorithms with existing directed clustering methods on both synthetic and real-world data, thus providing further ground to our theoretical contributions.</description>

      <title>SecGraph: Towards SGX-based Efficient and Confidentiality-Preserving Graph Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs have more expressive power and are widely researched in various search demand scenarios, compared with traditional relational and XML models. Today, many graph search services have been deployed on a third-party server, which can alleviate users from the burdens of maintaining large-scale graphs and huge computation costs. Nevertheless, outsourcing graph search services to the third-party server may invade users' privacy. PeGraph was recently proposed to achieve the encrypted search over the social graph. The main idea of PeGraph is to maintain two data structures XSet and TSet motivated by the OXT technology to support encrypted conductive search. However, PeGraph still has some limitations. First, PeGraph suffers from high communication and computation costs in search operations. Second, PeGraph cannot support encrypted search over dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose an SGX-based efficient and confidentiality-preserving graph search scheme SecGraph that can support insertion and deletion operations. We first design a new proxy-token generation method to reduce the communication cost. Then, we design an LDCF-encoded XSet based on the Logarithmic Dynamic Cuckoo Filter to reduce the computation cost. Finally, we design a new dynamic version of TSet named Twin-TSet to enable encrypted search over dynamic graphs. We have demonstrated the confidentiality preservation property of SecGraph through rigorous security analysis. Experiment results show that SecGraph yields up to 208x improvement in search time compared with PeGraph and the communication cost in PeGraph is up to 540x larger than that in SecGraph.</description>

      <title>SOLD: Sinhala Offensive Language Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread of offensive content online, such as hate speech and cyber-bullying, is a global phenomenon. This has sparked interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) communities, motivating the development of various systems trained to detect potentially harmful content automatically. These systems require annotated datasets to train the machine learning (ML) models. However, with a few notable exceptions, most datasets on this topic have dealt with English and a few other high-resource languages. As a result, the research in offensive language identification has been limited to these languages. This paper addresses this gap by tackling offensive language identification in Sinhala, a low-resource Indo-Aryan language spoken by over 17 million people in Sri Lanka. We introduce the Sinhala Offensive Language Dataset (SOLD) and present multiple experiments on this dataset. SOLD is a manually annotated dataset containing 10,000 posts from Twitter annotated as offensive and not offensive at both sentence-level and token-level, improving the explainability of the ML models. SOLD is the first large publicly available offensive language dataset compiled for Sinhala. We also introduce SemiSOLD, a larger dataset containing more than 145,000 Sinhala tweets, annotated following a semi-supervised approach.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Estimation and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15865v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study distributed estimation and learning problems in a networked environment where agents exchange information to estimate unknown statistical properties of random variables from their privately observed samples. The agents can collectively estimate the unknown quantities by exchanging information about their private observations, but they also face privacy risks. Our novel algorithms extend the existing distributed estimation literature and enable the participating agents to estimate a complete sufficient statistic from private signals acquired offline or online over time and to preserve the privacy of their signals and network neighborhoods. This is achieved through linear aggregation schemes with adjusted randomization schemes that add noise to the exchanged estimates subject to differential privacy (DP) constraints, both in an offline and online manner. We provide convergence rate analysis and tight finite-time convergence bounds. We show that the noise that minimizes the convergence time to the best estimates is the Laplace noise, with parameters corresponding to each agent's sensitivity to their signal and network characteristics. Our algorithms are amenable to dynamic topologies and balancing privacy and accuracy trade-offs. Finally, to supplement and validate our theoretical results, we run experiments on real-world data from the US Power Grid Network and electric consumption data from German Households to estimate the average power consumption of power stations and households under all privacy regimes and show that our method outperforms existing first-order, privacy-aware, distributed optimization methods.</description>

      <title>An Approach for Addressing Internally-Disconnected Communities in Louvain Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of identifying densely connected clusters of nodes within a network. The Louvain algorithm is a widely used method for this task, but it can produce communities that are internally disconnected. To address this, the Leiden algorithm was introduced. In this technical report, we propose another approach to mitigate this issue. On a system with two 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, our new parallel algorithm GSP-Louvain, based on the Louvain algorithm, addresses this issue, and outperforms the original Leiden, igraph Leiden, and NetworKit Leiden by 341x, 83x, and 6.1x respectively - achieving a processing rate of 328M edges/s on a 3.8B edge graph. Furthermore, GSP-Louvain improves performance at a rate of 1.5x for every doubling of threads.</description>

Abstract: Graph learning has become indispensable for interpreting and harnessing relational data in diverse fields, ranging from recommendation systems to social network analysis. In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.</description>

Abstract: The Influence Maximization (IM) problem seeks to discover the set of nodes in a graph that can spread the information propagation at most. This problem is known to be NP-hard, and it is usually studied by maximizing the influence (spread) and, optionally, optimizing a second objective, such as minimizing the seed set size or maximizing the influence fairness. However, in many practical scenarios multiple aspects of the IM problem must be optimized at the same time. In this work, we propose a first case study where several IM-specific objective functions, namely budget, fairness, communities, and time, are optimized on top of the maximization of influence and minimization of the seed set size. To this aim, we introduce MOEIM (Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Influence Maximization) a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) based on NSGA-II incorporating graph-aware operators and a smart initialization. We compare MOEIM in two experimental settings, including a total of nine graph datasets, two heuristic methods, a related MOEA, and a state-of-the-art Deep Learning approach. The experiments show that MOEIM overall outperforms the competitors in most of the tested many-objective settings. To conclude, we also investigate the correlation between the objectives, leading to novel insights into the topic. The codebase is available at https://github.com/eliacunegatti/MOEIM.</description>
