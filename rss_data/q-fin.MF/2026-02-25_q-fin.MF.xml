      <title>An Infinite-Dimensional Insider Trading Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the seminal framework of Kyle (1985) to a many-asset setting, bridging the gap between informed-trading theory and modern trading practices. Specifically, we formulate an infinite-dimensional Bayesian trading game in which the informed trader's private information may concern arbitrary aspects of the cross-sectional payoff structure across a continuum of traded assets. In this general setting, we obtain a parsimonious equilibrium characterized by a single scalar fixed point, yielding closed-form characterizations of equilibrium trading strategy, price impact within and across markets, and the informational efficiency of equilibrium prices.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control Problems with Infinite Horizon and Regime Switching Arising in Optimal Liquidation with Semimartingale Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an optimal control problem on infinite time horizon with semimartingale strategies, random coefficients and regime switching. The value function and the optimal strategy can be characterized in terms of three systems of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with infinite horizon. One of them is a system of linear BSDEs with unbounded coefficients and infinite horizon, which seems to be new in literature. We establish the existence of the solutions to these BSDEs by BMO analysis and comparison theorem for multi-dimensional BSDEs. Next, we establish that the optimal control problem is well posed, in the sense that the value function is finite and the optimal strategy-when it exists-is unique. This is achieved by reformulating the cost functional as the sum of a quadratic functional and the candidate value function. The reformulation crucially relies on the well-established well-posedness results for systems of BSDEs. Finally, under additional assumptions, we obtain the unique optimal strategy.</description>

      <title>Pricing energy spread options with variance gamma-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the pricing of energy spread options for spot prices following an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by a sum of independent multivariate variance gamma processes, which gives rise to mean-reverting, infinite activity price dynamics. Within this class of driving processes, the Esscher transform is used to obtain an equivalent martingale measure with a focus on the weak variance alpha-gamma process. By deriving an analytical formula for the cumulant generating function of the innovation term, we obtain a pricing formula for forwards and apply the FFT method of Hurd and Zhou to price spread options. Lastly, we demonstrate how the model should be both estimated on energy prices under the real world measure and calibrated on forward or call prices, and provide numerical results for the pricing of spread options.</description>

      <title>Roughness Analysis of Realized Volatility and VIX through Randomized Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel distribution-based estimator for the Hurst parameter of log-volatility, leveraging the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to assess the scaling behavior of entire distributions rather than individual moments. To address the temporal dependence of financial volatility, we propose a random permutation procedure that effectively removes serial correlation while preserving marginal distributions, enabling the rigorous application of the KS framework to dependent data. We establish the asymptotic variance of the estimator, useful for inference and confidence interval construction. From a computational standpoint, we show that derivative-free optimization methods, particularly Brent's method and the Nelder-Mead simplex, achieve substantial efficiency gains relative to grid search while maintaining estimation accuracy. Empirical analysis of the CBOE VIX index and the 5-minute realized volatility of the S&amp;P 500 reveals a statistically significant hierarchy of roughness, with implied volatility smoother than realized volatility. Both measures, however, exhibit Hurst exponents well below one-half, reinforcing the rough volatility paradigm and highlighting the open challenge of disentangling local roughness from long-memory effects in fractional modeling.</description>
