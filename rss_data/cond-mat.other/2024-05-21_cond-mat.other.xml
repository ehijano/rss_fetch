      <title>Exciton polariton critical non-Hermitian skin effect with spin-momentum-locked gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The critical skin effect, an intriguing phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, displays sensitivity to system size and manifests distinct dynamical behaviors. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to achieve the critical non-Hermitian skin effect of exciton polaritons in an elongated microcavity system. We show that by utilising longitudinal-transverse spin splitting and spin-momentum-locked gain, a critical non-Hermitian skin effect can be achieved in a continuous system without the need of an underlying lattice. We find that a phase transition can be induced by changing the cavity detuning with respect to the exciton energy. We identify a measurable order parameter associated with this phase transition and demonstrate the corresponding critical behavior. Our work offers a flexible approach to manipulate non-Hermitian phases of exciton polaritons, thereby expanding the potential applications of polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Universal spectra of noisy parameterized quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random unitaries are an important resource for quantum information processing. While their universal properties have been thoroughly analyzed, it is not known what happens to these properties when the unitaries are sampled on the present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We implement parameterized circuits, which have been proposed as a means to generate random unitaries, on a transmon platform and model these implementations as quantum maps. To retrieve the maps, a machine-learning assisted tomography is used. We find the spectrum of a map to be either an annulus or a disk depending on the circuit depth and detect an annulus-disk transition. By their spectral properties, the retrieved maps appear to be very similar to a recently introduced ensemble of random maps, for which spectral densities can be analytically evaluated.</description>

      <title>Formation of Iron-Helium Compounds under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While helium is a representative noble gas element characterized by its chemical inertness at ambient conditions, recent experiments and calculations argued that a minor amount of helium is incorporated into molten iron from silicate under high pressures. Here we examined the reaction between iron and helium at 8-42 GPa and ~1000-2820 K and found remarkable volume expansion of the Fe lattice, which is attributed to the formations of fcc and distorted hcp iron-helium compounds with x in FeHex up to 0.13 and 0.42, respectively. Upon releasing pressure under room temperature, these fcc and distorted hcp FeHex were still observed while the former lost some helium. In addition, our first-principles calculations indicate that fcc FeHe0.25, with He atoms in the tetrahedral interstitial sites, is dynamically stable in different magnetic states throughout 0-50 GPa. These results support that the Earth's core can be a large reservoir of primordial 3He.</description>

      <title>QUEST-DMC: Background Modelling and Resulting Heat Deposit for a Superfluid Helium-3 Bolometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of radioactivity assays and heat leak calculations for a range of common cryogenic materials, considered for use in the QUEST-DMC superfluid 3He dark matter detector. The bolometer, instrumented with nanomechanical resonators, will be sensitive to energy deposits from dark matter interactions. Events from radioactive decays and cosmic rays constitute a significant background and must be precisely modelled, using a combination of material screening and Monte Carlo simulations. However, the results presented here are of wider interest for experiments and quantum devices sensitive to minute heat leaks and spurious events, thus we present heat leak per unit mass or surface area for every material studied. This can inform material choices for other experiments, especially if underground operation is considered where the radiogenic backgrounds will dominate even at shallow depths.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-space topological invariants were widely used to characterize chiral-symmetric higher-order topological phases (HOTPs). However, a momentum-space characterization to these HOTPs, which essentially reveals their intrinsic bulk-boundary correspondence and facilitates their detection in quantum simulation systems, is still lacking. Here, we propose an experimentally observable momentum-space characterization to the chiral-symmetric HOTPs by the concept of polarized topological charges. It provides a unified description to topological phase transitions caused by the closing and reopening of band gap not only of the bulk states but also the edge states. Remarkably, these polarized topological charges can be identified by measuring the pseudospin structures. A feasible scheme to detect the HOTPs in the $^{87}$Rb cold atomic system is given. Our work opens an avenue for characterization and experimental detection of the chiral-symmetric HOTPs in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Transfer in Interacting, Multiple-Excitation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer (QST) describes the coherent passage of quantum information from one node in a network to another. Experiments on QST span a diverse set of platforms and currently report transport across up to tens of nodes in times of several hundred nanoseconds with fidelities that can approach 90% or more. Theoretical studies examine both the lossless time evolution associated with a given (Hermitian) lattice Hamiltonian and methods based on the master equation that allows for losses. In this paper, we describe Monte Carlo techniques which enable the discovery of a Hamiltonian that gives high-fidelity QST. We benchmark our approach in geometries appropriate to coupled optical cavity-emitter arrays and discuss connections to condensed matter Hamiltonians of localized orbitals coupled to conduction bands. The resulting Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard and periodic Anderson models can, in principle, be engineered in appropriate hardware to give efficient QST.</description>
