      <title>Dynamics of chemo-receptor activity with time-periodic attractant field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When exposed to a time-periodic chemical signal, an \textit{E.~coli} cell responds by modulating its receptor activity in a similar time-periodic manner. However, there exists a phase lag between the applied signal and the activity response. We study the variation of the activity amplitude and phase lag as a function of the applied frequency~$\omega$, using numerical simulations. The amplitude increases with~$\omega$, reaches a plateau, and then decreases again for large~$\omega$. The phase lag increases monotonically with~$\omega$ and finally saturates to $3\pi/2$ when~$\omega$ is large. The activity is no longer a single-valued function of the attractant signal, and plotting activity versus attractant concentration over one complete time period generates a loop. We monitor the loop area as a function of~$\omega$ and find two peaks for small and large~$\omega$, and a sharp minimum at intermediate~$\omega$ values. We explain these results as an interplay between the time scales associated with adaptation, activity switching, and applied signal variation. In particular, for very large~$\omega$, the quasi-equilibrium approximation for activity dynamics breaks down, a regime that has not been explored in earlier studies. We perform analytical calculations in this limit and find good agreement with our simulation results.</description>

      <title>Resonant spectral cascade in pulsatile flow triggered by arterial geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing geometric complexity of arteries with age is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, yet the precise physical mechanisms by which geometry interacts with blood flow remain debated. While complex geometry is known to increase viscous resistance, its active role in modulating flow dynamics is not fully understood. Here we solve a mathematical model to show that arterial geometry can trigger a resonant transfer of energy to short-wavelength components of the flow. The investigation, conducted over a physiological range of Womersley numbers (Wo, a dimensionless measure of pulsation frequency), reveal a dual dynamic. The global wave energy consistently decays, confirmed by a negative growth rate (G &lt; 0), indicating that the flow does not become exponentially unstable. However, a spectral broadening ratio (R), which quantifies the energy in high-wavenumber versus low-wavenumber modes, exhibits a sharp, non-monotonic peak at an intermediate Wo. This result identifies a resonant frequency at which geometry is maximally efficient at generating spectral complexity, even as the overall flow attenuates. These findings reframe the role of arterial geometry from a passive dissipator to an active modulator of the flow's spectral content, suggesting that spectral diagnostics could provide a sensitive marker for vascular health.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic multiphysics modeling reveals how blood pulsation drives CSF flow, pressure, and brain deformation under physiological and injection conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrathecal (IT) injection is an effective way to deliver drugs to the brain bypassing the blood-brain barrier. To evaluate and optimize IT drug delivery, it is necessary to understand the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in the central nervous system (CNS). In combination with experimental measurements, computational modeling plays an important role in reconstructing CSF flow in the CNS. Existing models have provided valuable insights into the CSF dynamics; however, most neglect the effects of tissue mechanics, focus on partial geometries, or rely on measured CSF flow rates under specific conditions, leaving full-CNS CSF flow field predictions across different physiological states underexplored. Here, we propose a comprehensive multiphysics computational model of the CNS with three key features: (1) it is implemented on a fully closed geometry of CNS; (2) it includes the interaction between CSF and poroelastic tissue as well as the compliant spinal dura mater; (3) it has potential for predictive simulations because it only needs data on cardiac blood pulsation into the brain. Our simulations under physiological conditions demonstrate that our model accurately reconstructs the CSF pulsation and captures both the craniocaudal attenuation and phase shift of CSF flow along the spinal subarachnoid space (SAS). When applied to the simulation of IT drug delivery, our model successfully captures the intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation during injection and subsequent recovery after injections. The proposed multiphysics model provides a unified and extensible framework that allows parametric studies of CSF flow dynamics and optimization of IT injections, serving as a strong foundation for integration of additional physiological mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Cognition as least action: the Physarum Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slime mould Physarum polycephalum displays adaptive transport dynamics and network formation that have inspired its use as a model of biological computation. We develop a Lagrangian formulation of Physarum's adaptive dynamics on predefined graphs, showing that steady states arise as extrema of a least-action functional balancing metabolic dissipation and transport efficiency. The organism's apparent ability to find optimal paths between nutrient sources and sinks emerges from minimizing global energy dissipation under predefined boundary conditions that specify the problem to be solved. Applied to ring, tree, and lattice geometries, the framework accurately reproduces the optimal conductance and flux configurations observed experimentally. These results show that Physarum's problem-solving on constrained topologies follows a physics-based variational principle, revealing least-action dynamics as the foundation of its adaptive organization.</description>

      <title>Genetically encoding stimulated Raman-scattering probes for cell imaging using infrared fluorescent proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy offers great potential to surpass fluorescent-based approaches, owing to the sharp linewidth of Raman vibrations amenable to super-multiplex cell imaging, but currently lacks one crucial component: genetically encodable tags equivalent to fluorescent proteins. Here, we show that infrared fluorescent proteins (IRFPs) can be used as genetically encoded SRS probes and benefit from the electronic pre-resonant SRS enhancement effect with near-infrared exciting pulses, comparable to synthetic dyes reported in the literature. SRS imaging of the nucleus in mammalian cells is demonstrated where a histone protein is fused to an IRFP. This work opens the route towards Raman-based cell imaging using genetically encoded probes, motivating efforts in solving the challenges of photostability and creating a vibrational palette.</description>

      <title>What is balance? A vital mechano-regulation paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within minutes of birth a newborn gnu or giraffe works to stand and walk, asserting postural balance and organised animate behaviour in an apparently goal-directed manner. In contrast, robots learning to stand and walk from scratch begin with random flailing, the behaviour cohering over time as the robot internalises some reward or value signal. How does the newborn gnu innately know what goal to aim for, and decide to work towards it? How could similar goal-directed balance learning be implemented in robots? Currently, animate balance inherits its axiomatic definition from the Newtonian formulation for inanimate balance - static mechanical equilibrium. This is arguably inappropriate for animate balance, because animals need to move and are never in static mechanical equilibrium, giving rise to the posture-movement paradox. The present perspective article proposes a more fluid, dynamical axiomatic task definition and goal which (a) isolates resisting gravity, (b) admits and enables movement, and (c) subsumes static mechanical equilibrium as a special case. This novel definition is founded upon inevitable biophysical requirements and observable developmental process. The article explains how animals apprehend and embed this goal through prenatal development suspended in equidense amniotic fluid, and then are challenged to self-maintain it by the perinatal transition. The account entails a paradigmatic shift in putative physiological organisation and associated conceptual framework for balance from a subsidiary sensorimotor control task, to a vital mechano-regulation task organisationally akin to thermo-regulation. This vital mechano-regulation model of balance has practical implications and implies a range of predictions.</description>

      <title>Spatially Correlated Noise Induces Transitions from the Diffusive to Ballistic Regime in Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuating incompressible Navier--Stokes equation driven by spatially correlated noise, characterized by a single length scale, and constructed to preserve thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation--dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends monotonically on the correlation length \(\ell\) and the correlation strength \(\beta\). Intuitively, increasing \(\ell\) enhances MSD and induces the emergence of an early-time ballistic regime, because a larger correlation length slows viscous momentum diffusion. Counterintuitively, decreasing \(\beta\) also increases the MSD, because a weaker correlation strength decelerates fluid momentum diffusion. Thus, the emergence or suppression of the ballistic regime stems from the competition between momentum correlation and viscous dissipation. We further show that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equation, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Modeling of Single-Cell Transcriptomics: Capturing Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies. No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>
