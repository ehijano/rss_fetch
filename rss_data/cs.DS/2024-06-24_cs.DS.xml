      <title>NP-Completeness of the Combinatorial Distance Matrix Realisation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-CombDMR problem is that of determining whether an $n \times n$ distance matrix can be realised by $n$ vertices in some undirected graph with $n + k$ vertices. This problem has a simple solution in the case $k=0$. In this paper we show that this problem is polynomial time solvable for $k=1$ and $k=2$. Moreover, we provide algorithms to construct such graph realisations by solving appropriate 2-SAT instances. In the case where $k \geq 3$, this problem is NP-complete. We show this by a reduction of the $k$-colourability problem to the $k$-CombDMR problem. Finally, we discuss the simpler polynomial time solvable problem of tree realisability for a given distance matrix.</description>

      <title>Colorful Priority $k$-Supplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Priority $k$-Supplier problem the input consists of a metric space $(F \cup C, d)$ over set of facilities $F$ and a set of clients $C$, an integer $k &gt; 0$, and a non-negative radius $r_v$ for each client $v \in C$. The goal is to select $k$ facilities $S \subseteq F$ to minimize $\max_{v \in C} \frac{d(v,S)}{r_v}$ where $d(v,S)$ is the distance of $v$ to the closes facility in $S$. This problem generalizes the well-studied $k$-Center and $k$-Supplier problems, and admits a $3$-approximation [Plesn\'ik, 1987, Bajpai et al., 2022. In this paper we consider two outlier versions. The Priority $k$-Supplier with Outliers problem [Bajpai et al., 2022] allows a specified number of outliers to be uncovered, and the Priority Colorful $k$-Supplier problem is a further generalization where clients are partitioned into $c$ colors and each color class allows a specified number of outliers. These problems are partly motivated by recent interest in fairness in clustering and other optimization problems involving algorithmic decision making.
  We build upon the work of [Bajpai et al., 2022] and improve their $9$-approximation Priority $k$-Supplier with Outliers problem to a $1+3\sqrt{3}\approx 6.196$-approximation. For the Priority Colorful $k$-Supplier problem, we present the first set of approximation algorithms. For the general case with $c$ colors, we achieve a $17$-pseudo-approximation using $k+2c-1$ centers. For the setting of $c=2$, we obtain a $7$-approximation in random polynomial time, and a $2+\sqrt{5}\approx 4.236$-pseudo-approximation using $k+1$ centers.</description>

      <title>Space-efficient SLP Encoding for $O(\log N)$-time Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Straight-Line Program (SLP) $G$ for a string $T$ is a context-free grammar (CFG) that derives $T$ only, which can be considered as a compressed representation of $T$. In this paper, we show how to encode $G$ in $n \lceil \lg N \rceil + (n + n') \lceil \lg (n+\sigma) \rceil + 4n - 2n' + o(n)$ bits to support random access queries of extracting $T[p..q]$ in worst-case $O(\log N + p - q)$ time, where $N$ is the length of $T$, $\sigma$ is the alphabet size, $n$ is the number of variables in $G$ and $n' \le n$ is the number of symmetric centroid paths in the DAG representation for $G$.</description>

      <title>Minimum+1 Steiner Cuts and Dual Edge Sensitivity Oracle: Bridging the Gap between Global cut and (s,t)-cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected multi-graph on $n=|V|$ vertices and $S\subseteq V$ be a Steiner set. Steiner cut is a fundamental concept; moreover, global cut $(|S|=n)$, as well as (s,t)-cut $(|S|=2)$, is just a special case of Steiner cut. We study Steiner cuts of capacity minimum+1, and as an important application, we provide a dual edge Sensitivity Oracle for Steiner mincut.
  A compact data structure for cuts of capacity minimum+1 has been designed for both global cuts [STOC 1995] and (s,t)-cuts [TALG 2023]. Moreover, both data structures are also used crucially to design a dual edge Sensitivity Oracle for their respective mincuts. Unfortunately, except for these two extreme scenarios of Steiner cuts, no generalization of these results is known. Therefore, to address this gap, we present the following first results on Steiner cuts.
  1. Data Structure: There is an $O(n(n-|S|+1))$ space data structure that can determine in $O(1)$ time whether a given pair of vertices is separated by a Steiner cut of capacity at least minimum+1. It can report such a cut, if it exists, in $O(n)$ time.
  2. Sensitivity Oracle: (a) There is an $O(n(n-|S|+1))$ space data structure that, after the failure/insertion of any pair of edges, can report the capacity of Steiner mincut in $O(1)$ time and a Steiner mincut in $O(n)$ time. (b) If we are interested in reporting only the capacity, there is a more compact data structure that occupies $O((n-|S|)^2+n)$ space and reports the capacity in $O(1)$ time after the failure/insertion of any pair of edges.
  3. Lower Bound: For undirected multi-graphs, for every Steiner set $S$, any data structure that, after the failure or insertion of any pair of edges, can report the capacity of Steiner mincut must occupy $\Omega((n-|S|)^2)$ bits of space, irrespective of the query time.</description>

      <title>Supermodular Approximation of Norms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many classical problems in theoretical computer science involve norm, even if implicitly; for example, both XOS functions and downward-closed sets are equivalent to some norms. The last decade has seen a lot of interest in designing algorithms beyond the standard $\ell_p$ norms $\|\cdot \|_p$. Despite notable advancements, many existing methods remain tailored to specific problems, leaving a broader applicability to general norms less understood. This paper investigates the intrinsic properties of $\ell_p$ norms that facilitate their widespread use and seeks to abstract these qualities to a more general setting.
  We identify supermodularity -- often reserved for combinatorial set functions and characterized by monotone gradients -- as a defining feature beneficial for $ \|\cdot\|_p^p$. We introduce the notion of $p$-supermodularity for norms, asserting that a norm is $p$-supermodular if its $p^{th}$ power function exhibits supermodularity. The association of supermodularity with norms offers a new lens through which to view and construct algorithms.
  Our work demonstrates that for a large class of problems $p$-supermodularity is a sufficient criterion for developing good algorithms. This is either by reframing existing algorithms for problems like Online Load-Balancing and Bandits with Knapsacks through a supermodular lens, or by introducing novel analyses for problems such as Online Covering, Online Packing, and Stochastic Probing. Moreover, we prove that every symmetric norm can be approximated by a $p$-supermodular norm. Together, these recover and extend several results from the literature, and support $p$-supermodularity as a unified theoretical framework for optimization challenges centered around norm-related problems.</description>

      <title>Setting Targets is All You Need:Improved Order Competitive Ratio for Online Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a rising interest for studying the online benchmark as an alternative of the classical offline benchmark in online stochastic settings. Ezra, Feldman, Gravin, and Tang (SODA 2023) introduced the notion of order-competitive ratio, defined as the worst-case ratio between the performance of the best order-unaware algorithm and the best order-aware algorithm, to quantify the loss incurred by the lack of knowledge of the arrival order. They showed in the online single selection setting (a.k.a. the prophet problem), the optimal order-competitive ratio achieved by deterministic algorithms is $1/\varphi \approx 0.618$, and left with an open question whether randomized algorithms can do better.
  We answer the open question firmly by introducing a novel family of algorithms called \emph{targeted value algorithms}. We show that the task of online selection is as easy as guessing the optimal online benchmark. Specifically, we provide 1) an alternative optimal $1/\varphi$ order-competitive algorithm by setting the targeted value deterministically, and 2) a $0.732$ order-competitive algorithm by setting the targeted value randomly. We further provide a $0.758$ upper bound on the order-competitive ratio of our algorithm, showing that our analysis is close to the best possible, and establish an upper bound of $0.829$ on the order-competitive ratio for general randomized order-unaware algorithms.</description>

      <title>Proceedings of the 13th edition of the conference on Random Generation of Combinatorial Structures. Polyominoes and Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conference GASCom brings together researchers in combinatorics, algorithms, probabilities, and more generally mathematical computer science, around the theme of random and exhaustive generation of combinatorial structures, mostly considered from a theoretical point of view. In connection with this main theme, the conference is also interested in contributions in enumerative or analytic combinatorics, and interactions with other areas of mathematics, computer science, physics or biology. The conference is both interested in methods for random or exhaustive generation and in original results on combinatorial or algorithmic questions, whose solution has been made possible by an approach involving random or exhaustive generation. The present edition of the conference includes a specific bunch of talks dedicated to polyominoes and tilings.
  A (not exhaustive) list of topics of the conference is: random and exhaustive generation of combinatorial objects; tilings and polyominoes; bijective, enumerative, algebraic and analytic combinatorics; algorithmic aspects: analysis of algorithms, probabilistic algorithms; interactions: bio-informatics, combinatorics on words, number theory.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-Resilient Trades for Dynamic Service Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A combinatorial trade is a pair of sets of blocks of elements that can be exchanged while preserving relevant subset intersection constraints. The class of balanced and swap-robust minimal trades was proposed in [1] for exchanging blocks of data chunks stored on distributed storage systems in an access- and load-balanced manner. More precisely, data chunks in the trades of interest are labeled by popularity ranks and the blocks are required to have both balanced overall popularity and stability properties with respect to swaps in chunk popularities. The original construction of such trades relied on computer search and paired balanced sets obtained through iterative combining of smaller sets that have provable stability guarantees. To reduce the substantial gap between the results of prior approaches and the known theoretical lower bound, we present new analytical upper and lower bounds on the minimal disbalance of blocks introduced by limited-magnitude popularity ranking swaps. Our constructive and near-optimal approach relies on pairs of graphs whose vertices are two balanced sets with edges/arcs that capture the balance and potential balance changes induced by limited-magnitude popularity swaps. In particular, we show that if we start with carefully selected balanced trades and limit the magnitude of rank swaps to one, the new upper and lower bound on the maximum block disbalance caused by a swap only differ by a factor of $1.07$. We also extend these results for larger popularity swap magnitudes.</description>

      <title>On the Correlation Gap of Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set function can be extended to the unit cube in various ways; the correlation gap measures the ratio between two natural extensions. This quantity has been identified as the performance guarantee in a range of approximation algorithms and mechanism design settings. It is known that the correlation gap of a monotone submodular function is at least $1-1/e$, and this is tight for simple matroid rank functions.
  We initiate a fine-grained study of the correlation gap of matroid rank functions. In particular, we present an improved lower bound on the correlation gap as parametrized by the rank and girth of the matroid. We also show that for any matroid, the correlation gap of its weighted matroid rank function is minimized under uniform weights. Such improved lower bounds have direct applications for submodular maximization under matroid constraints, mechanism design, and contention resolution schemes.</description>

      <title>Fast sampling from constrained spaces using the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method called the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin algorithm for approximate sampling from distributions whose support is a compact and convex set. This algorithm adds an accept-reject filter to the Markov chain induced by a single step of the Mirror Langevin algorithm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is a basic discretisation of the Mirror Langevin dynamics. Due to the inclusion of this filter, our method is unbiased relative to the target, while known discretisations of the Mirror Langevin dynamics including the Mirror Langevin algorithm have an asymptotic bias. For this algorithm, we also give upper bounds for the number of iterations taken to mix to a constrained distribution whose potential is relatively smooth, convex, and Lipschitz continuous with respect to a self-concordant mirror function. As a consequence of the reversibility of the Markov chain induced by the inclusion of the Metropolis-Hastings filter, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on the error tolerance for approximate constrained sampling. We also present numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Testing Calibration in Nearly-Linear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent literature on machine learning and decision making, calibration has emerged as a desirable and widely-studied statistical property of the outputs of binary prediction models. However, the algorithmic aspects of measuring model calibration have remained relatively less well-explored. Motivated by [BGHN23], which proposed a rigorous framework for measuring distances to calibration, we initiate the algorithmic study of calibration through the lens of property testing. We define the problem of calibration testing from samples where given $n$ draws from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ on $(predictions, binary outcomes)$, our goal is to distinguish between the case where $\mathcal{D}$ is perfectly calibrated, and the case where $\mathcal{D}$ is $\varepsilon$-far from calibration.
  We make the simple observation that the empirical smooth calibration linear program can be reformulated as an instance of minimum-cost flow on a highly-structured graph, and design an exact dynamic programming-based solver for it which runs in time $O(n\log^2(n))$, and solves the calibration testing problem information-theoretically optimally in the same time. This improves upon state-of-the-art black-box linear program solvers requiring $\Omega(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega &gt; 2$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. We also develop algorithms for tolerant variants of our testing problem improving upon black-box linear program solvers, and give sample complexity lower bounds for alternative calibration measures to the one considered in this work. Finally, we present experiments showing the testing problem we define faithfully captures standard notions of calibration, and that our algorithms scale efficiently to accommodate large sample sizes.</description>
