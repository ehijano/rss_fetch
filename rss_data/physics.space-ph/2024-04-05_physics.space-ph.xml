      <title>The Independence of Magnetic Turbulent Power Spectra to the Presence of Switchbacks in the Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An outstanding gap in our knowledge of the solar wind is the relationship between switchbacks and solar wind turbulence. Switchbacks are large fluctuations, even reversals, of the background magnetic field embedded in the solar wind flow. It has been proposed that switchbacks may form as a product of turbulence and decay via coupling with the turbulent cascade. In this work, we examine how properties of solar wind magnetic field turbulence vary in the presence or absence of switchbacks. Specifically, we use in-situ particle and fields measurements from Parker Solar Probe to measure magnetic field turbulent wave power, separately in the inertial and kinetic ranges, as a function of switchback magnetic deflection angle. We demonstrate that the angle between the background magnetic field and the solar wind velocity in the spacecraft frame ($\theta_{vB}$) strongly determines whether Parker Solar Probe samples wave power parallel or perpendicular to the background magnetic field. Further, we show that $\theta_{vB}$ is strongly modulated by the switchback magnetic deflection angle. In this analysis, we demonstrate that switchback deflection angle does not correspond to any significant increase in wave power in either the inertial range or at kinetic scales. This result implies that switchbacks do not strongly couple to the turbulent cascade in the inertial or kinetic ranges via turbulent wave-particle interactions. Therefore, we do not expect switchbacks to contribute significantly to solar wind heating through this type of energy conversion pathway, although contributions via other mechanisms, such as magnetic reconnection may still be significant.</description>

      <title>Complexity Heliophysics: A lived and living history of systems and complexity science in Heliophysics</title>

Abstract: This review examines complexity science in Heliophysics, describing it not as a discipline, but as a paradigm. In the context of Heliophysics, complexity science is the study of a star, interplanetary environment, magnetosphere, upper and terrestrial atmospheres, and planetary surface as interacting subsystems. Complexity science studies entities in a system (e.g., electrons in an atom, planets in a solar system, individuals in a society) and their interactions, and is the nature of what emerges from these interactions. It is a paradigm that employs systems approaches and is inherently multi- and cross-scale. Heliophysics processes span at least 15 orders of magnitude in space and another 15 in time, and its reaches go well beyond our own solar system and Earth's space environment to touch planetary, exoplanetary, and astrophysical domains. It is an uncommon domain within which to explore complexity science.
  This review article excavates the lived and living history of complexity science in Heliophysics. It identifies five dimensions of complexity science. It then proceeds in three epochal parts: 1) A pivotal year in the Complexity Heliophysics paradigm: 1996; 2) The transitional years that established foundations of the paradigm (1996-2010); and 3) The emergent literature largely beyond 2010.
  The history reveals a grand challenge that confronts most physical sciences to understand the research intersection between fundamental science (e.g., complexity science) and applied science (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). A risk science framework is suggested as a way of formulating the challenges in a way that the two converge.
  The intention is to provide inspiration and guide future research. It will be instructive to Heliophysics researchers, but also to any reader interested in or hoping to advance the frontier of systems and complexity science.</description>
