      <description>arXiv:2411.13318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This volume contains the proceedings of EXPRESS/SOS 2024: the Combined 31st International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and the 21st Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics, which was held in Calgary, Canada, as an affiliated workshop of CONFEST 2024. The EXPRESS/SOS workshop series aims at bringing together researchers interested in the formal semantics of systems and programming concepts, and in the expressiveness of computational models.</description>

      <title>Complete Test Suites for Automata in Monoidal Closed Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformance testing of automata is about checking the equivalence of a known specification and a black-box implementation. An important notion in conformance testing is that of a complete test suite, which guarantees that if an implementation satisfying certain conditions passes all tests, then it is equivalent to the specification.
  We introduce a framework for proving completeness of test suites at the general level of automata in monoidal closed categories. Moreover, we provide a generalization of a classical conformance testing technique, the W-method. We demonstrate the applicability of our results by recovering the W-method for deterministic finite automata, Moore machines, and Mealy machines, and by deriving new instances of complete test suites for weighted automata and deterministic nominal automata.</description>

      <title>Executable QR codes with Machine Learning for Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Executable QR codes, also known as eQR codes or just sQRy, are a special kind of QR codes that embed programs conceived to run on mobile devices like smartphones. Since the program is directly encoded in binary form within the QR code, it can be executed even when the reading device is not provided with Internet access. The applications of this technology are manifold, and range from smart user guides to advisory systems. The first programming language made available for eQR is QRtree, which enables the implementation of decision trees aimed, for example, at guiding the user in operating/maintaining a complex machinery or for reaching a specific location.
  In this work, an additional language is proposed, we term QRind, which was specifically devised for Industry. It permits to integrate distinct computational blocks into the QR code, e.g., machine learning models to enable predictive maintenance and algorithms to ease machinery usage. QRind permits the Industry 4.0/5.0 paradigms to be implemented, in part, also in those cases where Internet is unavailable.</description>

      <title>Geodesic languages for rational subsets and conjugates in virtually free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a subset of a virtually free group is rational if and only if the language of geodesic words representing its elements (in any generating set) is rational and that the language of geodesics representing conjugates of elements in a rational subset of a virtually free group is context-free. As a corollary, the doubly generalized conjugacy problem is decidable for rational subsets of finitely generated virtually free groups: there is an algorithm taking as input two rational subsets $K_1$ and $K_2$ of a virtually free group that decides whether there is one element of $K_1$ conjugate to an element of $K_2$. For free groups, we prove that the same problem is decidable with rational constraints on the set of conjugators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high complexity of DNS poses unique challenges for ensuring its security and reliability. Despite continuous advances in DNS testing, monitoring, and verification, protocol-level defects still give rise to numerous bugs and attacks. In this paper, we provide the first decision procedure for the DNS verification problem, establishing its complexity as $\mathsf{2ExpTime}$, which was previously unknown.
  We begin by formalizing the semantics of DNS as a system of recursive communicating processes extended with timers and an infinite message alphabet. We provide an algebraic abstraction of the alphabet with finitely many equivalence classes, using the subclass of semigroups that recognize positive prefix-testable languages. We then introduce a novel generalization of bisimulation for labelled transition systems, weaker than strong bisimulation, to show that our abstraction is sound and complete. Finally, using this abstraction, we reduce the DNS verification problem to the verification problem for pushdown systems. To show the expressiveness of our framework, we model two of the most prominent attack vectors on DNS, namely amplification attacks and rewrite blackholing.</description>
