      <title>Floating exercise boundaries for American options in time-inhomogeneous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models characterized by negative interest rates (for equity/FX) or negative convenience yields (for commodities/cryptocurrencies). Under such conditions, exercise boundaries may exhibit a "floating" structure - dynamically appearing and disappearing. For example, a second exercise boundary could emerge within the computational domain and subsequently both could collapse, demanding specialized pricing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Mean-Reverting SABR Models: Closed-form Surfaces and Calibration for Equities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider three stochastic-volatility models, each characterized by distinct dynamics of instantaneous volatility: (1) a CIR process for squared volatility (i.e., the classical Heston model); (2) a mean-reverting lognormal process for volatility; and (3) a CIR process for volatility. Previous research has provided semi-analytical approximations for these models in the form of simple (non-mean-reverting) SABR models, each suitably parameterized for a given expiry.
  First, using a computer algebra system, we derive closed-form expressions for these semi-analytical approximations, under the assumption that all parameters remain constant (but without the constraint of constant expected volatility). Although the resulting formulas are considerably lengthier than those in simpler SABR models, they remain tractable and are easily implementable even in Excel.
  Second, employing these closed-form expressions, we calibrate the three models to empirical volatility surfaces observed in EuroStoxx index options. The calibration is well-behaved and achieves excellent fits for the observed equity-volatility surfaces, with only five parameters per surface. Consequently, the approximate models offer a simpler, faster, and (numerically) more reliable alternative to the classical Heston model, or to more advanced models, which lack closed-form solutions and can be numerically challenging, particularly in less sophisticated implementation environments.
  Third, we examine the stability and correlations of our parameter estimates. In this analysis, we identify certain issues with the models - one of which appears to stem from the sub-lognormal behavior of the actual equity-volatility process. Notably, the CIR-volatility model (3), as opposed to the CIR-variance Heston model (1), seems to best capture this behavior, and also results in more stable parameters.</description>

      <title>On an Optimal Stopping Problem with a Discontinuous Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an optimal stopping problem with an unbounded, time-dependent and discontinuous reward function. This problem is motivated by the pricing of a variable annuity contract with guaranteed minimum maturity benefit, under the assumption that the policyholder's surrender behaviour maximizes the risk-neutral value of the contract. We consider a general fee and surrender charge function, and give a condition under which optimal stopping always occurs at maturity. Using an alternative representation for the value function of the optimization problem, we study its analytical properties and the resulting surrender (or exercise) region. In particular, we show that the non-emptiness and the shape of the surrender region are fully characterized by the fee and the surrender charge functions, which provides a powerful tool to understand their interrelation and how it affects early surrenders and the optimal surrender boundary. Under certain conditions on these two functions, we develop three representations for the value function; two are analogous to their American option counterpart, and one is new to the actuarial and American option pricing literature.</description>

      <title>NUFFT for the Fast COS Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The COS method is a very efficient way to compute European option prices under L\'evy models or affine stochastic volatility models, based on a Fourier Cosine expansion of the density, involving the characteristic function. This note shows how to compute the COS method formula with a non-uniform fast Fourier transform, thus allowing to price many options of the same maturity but different strikes at an unprecedented speed.</description>
