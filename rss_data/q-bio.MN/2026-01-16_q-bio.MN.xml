      <title>Markovian Promoter Models: A Mechanistic Alternative to Hill Functions in Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks are typically modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with phenomenological Hill functions to represent transcriptional regulation. While computationally efficient, Hill functions lack mechanistic grounding and cannot capture stochastic promoter dynamics. We present a hybrid Markovian-ODE framework that explicitly models discrete promoter states while maintaining computational tractability. Uniquely, we parameterize this model using fractional dwell times derived from ChEC-seq data, enabling the inference of in vivo kinetic rates from steady-state chromatin profiling. Our approach tracks individual transcription factor binding events as a continuous-time Markov chain, linked to deterministic molecular dynamics. We validate this framework on seven gene regulatory systems spanning basic to advanced complexity: the GAL system, repressilator, Goodwin oscillator, toggle switch, incoherent feed-forward loop, p53-Mdm2 oscillator, and NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Comparison with stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) ground truth demonstrates that Markovian promoter models achieve similar accuracy to full stochastic simulations while being 10-100$\times$ faster. Our framework provides a mechanistic foundation for gene regulation modeling and enables investigation of promoter-level stochasticity in complex regulatory networks.</description>

      <title>A flux-based approach for analyzing the disguised toric locus of reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems with polynomial right-hand sides are very important in various applications, e.g., in biochemistry and population dynamics. The mathematical study of these dynamical systems is challenging due to the possibility of multistability, oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. One important tool for this study is the concept of reaction systems, which are dynamical systems generated by reaction networks for some choices of parameter values. Among these, disguised toric systems are remarkably stable: they have a unique attracting fixed point, and cannot give rise to oscillations or chaotic dynamics. The computation of the set of parameter values for which a network gives rise to disguised toric systems (i.e., the disguised toric locus of the network) is an important but difficult task. We introduce new ideas based on network fluxes for studying the disguised toric locus. We prove that the disguised toric locus of any network $G$ is a contractible manifold with boundary, and introduce an associated graph $G^{\max}$ that characterizes its interior. These theoretical tools allow us, for the first time, to compute the full disguised toric locus for many networks of interest.</description>

      <title>Largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largest connected component in duplication-divergence growing graphs with symmetric coupled divergence is studied. Finite-size scaling reveals a phase transition occurring at a divergence rate $\delta_c$. The $\delta_c$ found stands near the locus of zero in Euler characteristic for finite-size graphs, known to be indicative of the largest connected component transition. The role of non-interacting vertices in shaping this transition, with their presence ($d=0$) and absence ($d=1$) in duplication is also discussed, suggesting a particular transformation of the time variable considered yielding a singularity locus in the natural logarithm of the absolute value of Euler characteristic in finite-size graphs close to that obtained with $d=1$ but from the model with $d=0$. The findings may suggest implications for bond percolation in these growing graph models.</description>
