      <title>Counterpoint: Orchestrating Large-Scale Custom Animated Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Custom animated visualizations of large, complex datasets are helpful across many domains, but they are hard to develop. Much of the difficulty arises from maintaining visualization state across many animated graphical elements that may change in number over time. We contribute Counterpoint, a framework for state management designed to help implement such visualizations in JavaScript. Using Counterpoint, developers can manipulate large collections of marks with reactive attributes that are easy to render in scalable APIs such as Canvas and WebGL. Counterpoint also helps orchestrate the entry and exit of graphical elements using the concept of a rendering "stage." Through a performance evaluation, we show that Counterpoint adds minimal overhead over current high-performance rendering techniques while simplifying implementation. We provide two examples of visualizations created using Counterpoint that illustrate its flexibility and compatibility with other visualization toolkits as well as considerations for users with disabilities. Counterpoint is open-source and available at https://github.com/cmudig/counterpoint.</description>

      <title>F\"urElise: Capturing and Physically Synthesizing Hand Motions of Piano Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piano playing requires agile, precise, and coordinated hand control that stretches the limits of dexterity. Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</description>

      <title>Local Surface Parameterizations via Geodesic Splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general method for computing local parameterizations rooted at a point on a surface, where the surface is described only through a signed implicit function and a corresponding projection function. Using a two-stage process, we compute several points radially emanating from the map origin, and interpolate between them with a spline surface. The narrow interface of our method allows it to support several kinds of geometry such as signed distance functions, general analytic implicit functions, triangle meshes, neural implicits, and point clouds. We demonstrate the high quality of our generated parameterizations on a variety of examples, and show applications in local texturing and surface curve drawing.</description>

      <title>Focal Surface Holographic Light Transport using Learned Spatially Adaptive Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Generated Holography (CGH) is a set of algorithmic methods for identifying holograms that reconstruct Three-Dimensi-onal (3D) scenes in holographic displays. CGH algorithms decompose 3D scenes into multiplanes at different depth levels and rely on simulations of light that propagated from a source plane to a targeted plane. Thus, for n planes, CGH typically optimizes holograms using n plane-to-plane light transport simulations, leading to major time and computational demands. Our work replaces multiple planes with a focal surface and introduces a learned light transport model that could propagate a light field from a source plane to the focal surface in a single inference. Our learned light transport model leverages spatially adaptive convolution to achieve depth-varying propagation demanded by targeted focal surfaces. The proposed model reduces the hologram optimization process up to 1.5x, which contributes to hologram dataset generation and the training of future learned CGH models.</description>

      <title>ELMO: Enhanced Real-time LiDAR Motion Capture through Upsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ELMO, a real-time upsampling motion capture framework designed for a single LiDAR sensor. Modeled as a conditional autoregressive transformer-based upsampling motion generator, ELMO achieves 60 fps motion capture from a 20 fps LiDAR point cloud sequence. The key feature of ELMO is the coupling of the self-attention mechanism with thoughtfully designed embedding modules for motion and point clouds, significantly elevating the motion quality. To facilitate accurate motion capture, we develop a one-time skeleton calibration model capable of predicting user skeleton offsets from a single-frame point cloud. Additionally, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique utilizing a LiDAR simulator, which enhances global root tracking to improve environmental understanding. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare ELMO with state-of-the-art methods in both image-based and point cloud-based motion capture. We further conduct an ablation study to validate our design principles. ELMO's fast inference time makes it well-suited for real-time applications, exemplified in our demo video featuring live streaming and interactive gaming scenarios. Furthermore, we contribute a high-quality LiDAR-mocap synchronized dataset comprising 20 different subjects performing a range of motions, which can serve as a valuable resource for future research. The dataset and evaluation code are available at {\blue \url{https://movin3d.github.io/ELMO_SIGASIA2024/}}</description>

      <title>Curve Segment Neighborhood-based Vector Field Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integral curves have been widely used to represent and analyze various vector fields. In this paper, we propose a Curve Segment Neighborhood Graph (CSNG) to capture the relationships between neighboring curve segments. This graph representation enables us to adapt the fast community detection algorithm, i.e., the Louvain algorithm, to identify individual graph communities from CSNG. Our results show that these communities often correspond to the features of the flow. To achieve a multi-level interactive exploration of the detected communities, we adapt a force-directed layout that allows users to refine and re-group communities based on their domain knowledge. We incorporate the proposed techniques into an interactive system to enable effective analysis and interpretation of complex patterns in large-scale integral curve datasets.</description>

      <title>Vector Grimoire: Codebook-based Shape Generation under Raster Image Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a popular format on the web and in the design industry. However, despite the great strides made in generative modeling, SVG has remained underexplored due to the discrete and complex nature of such data. We introduce GRIMOIRE, a text-guided SVG generative model that is comprised of two modules: A Visual Shape Quantizer (VSQ) learns to map raster images onto a discrete codebook by reconstructing them as vector shapes, and an Auto-Regressive Transformer (ART) models the joint probability distribution over shape tokens, positions and textual descriptions, allowing us to generate vector graphics from natural language. Unlike existing models that require direct supervision from SVG data, GRIMOIRE learns shape image patches using only raster image supervision which opens up vector generative modeling to significantly more data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by fitting GRIMOIRE for closed filled shapes on the MNIST and for outline strokes on icon and font data, surpassing previous image-supervised methods in generative quality and vector-supervised approach in flexibility.</description>

      <title>Resolution limit of the eye: how many pixels can we see?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large engineering efforts go towards improving the resolution of mobile, AR and VR displays, it is important to know the maximum resolution at which further improvements bring no noticeable benefit. This limit is often referred to as the "retinal resolution", although the limiting factor may not necessarily be attributed to the retina. To determine the ultimate resolution at which an image appears sharp to our eyes with no perceivable blur, we created an experimental setup with a sliding display, which allows for continuous control of the resolution. The lack of such control was the main limitation of the previous studies. We measure achromatic (black-white) and chromatic (red-green and yellow-violet) resolution limits for foveal vision, and at two eccentricities (10 and 20 deg). Our results demonstrate that the resolution limit is higher than what was previously believed, reaching 94 pixels-per-degree (ppd) for foveal achromatic vision, 89 ppd for red-green patterns, and 53 ppd for yellow-violet patterns. We also observe a much larger drop in the resolution limit for chromatic patterns (red-green and yellow-violet) than for achromatic. Our results set the north star for display development, with implications for future imaging, rendering and video coding technologies.</description>

      <title>RealityCraft: An In-Situ CAD+CAM Interface for Novices via Scene-Aware Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing accessibility of augmented reality (AR) for visualization, existing computer-aided design systems remain largely confined to traditional screens and are often inaccessible to novice users due to their complexity. We present RealityCraft, an open-sourced AR interface that enables in-situ computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD+CAM) for novices. Unlike traditional CAD systems confined to computer screens, RealityCraft allows users to design directly within their physical environments, with primitive geometries. RealityCraft recognizes and utilizes physical constraints such as furniture and walls, enhancing user interaction through spatial awareness and depth occlusion. Furthermore, RealityCraft features an integrated AR-based 3D printing workflow, where users can drag and drop designs onto their 3D printer's virtual twin in their immediate space. Through a user study, we demonstrate that RealityCraft enhances engagement and ease of use for novices. By bridging the gap between digital creation and physical output, RealityCraft aims to transform everyday spaces into creative studios.</description>

      <title>RelitLRM: Generative Relightable Radiance for Large Reconstruction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose RelitLRM, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for generating high-quality Gaussian splatting representations of 3D objects under novel illuminations from sparse (4-8) posed images captured under unknown static lighting. Unlike prior inverse rendering methods requiring dense captures and slow optimization, often causing artifacts like incorrect highlights or shadow baking, RelitLRM adopts a feed-forward transformer-based model with a novel combination of a geometry reconstructor and a relightable appearance generator based on diffusion. The model is trained end-to-end on synthetic multi-view renderings of objects under varying known illuminations. This architecture design enables to effectively decompose geometry and appearance, resolve the ambiguity between material and lighting, and capture the multi-modal distribution of shadows and specularity in the relit appearance. We show our sparse-view feed-forward RelitLRM offers competitive relighting results to state-of-the-art dense-view optimization-based baselines while being significantly faster.

      <title>SD-$\pi$XL: Generating Low-Resolution Quantized Imagery via Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-resolution quantized imagery, such as pixel art, is seeing a revival in modern applications ranging from video game graphics to digital design and fabrication, where creativity is often bound by a limited palette of elemental units. Despite their growing popularity, the automated generation of quantized images from raw inputs remains a significant challenge, often necessitating intensive manual input. We introduce SD-$\pi$XL, an approach for producing quantized images that employs score distillation sampling in conjunction with a differentiable image generator. Our method enables users to input a prompt and optionally an image for spatial conditioning, set any desired output size $H \times W$, and choose a palette of $n$ colors or elements. Each color corresponds to a distinct class for our generator, which operates on an $H \times W \times n$ tensor. We adopt a softmax approach, computing a convex sum of elements, thus rendering the process differentiable and amenable to backpropagation. We show that employing Gumbel-softmax reparameterization allows for crisp pixel art effects. Unique to our method is the ability to transform input images into low-resolution, quantized versions while retaining their key semantic features. Our experiments validate SD-$\pi$XL's performance in creating visually pleasing and faithful representations, consistently outperforming the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we showcase SD-$\pi$XL's practical utility in fabrication through its applications in interlocking brick mosaic, beading and embroidery design.</description>

      <title>Towards a GENEA Leaderboard -- an Extended, Living Benchmark for Evaluating and Advancing Conversational Motion Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current evaluation practices in speech-driven gesture generation lack standardisation and focus on aspects that are easy to measure over aspects that actually matter. This leads to a situation where it is impossible to know what is the state of the art, or to know which method works better for which purpose when comparing two publications. In this position paper, we review and give details on issues with existing gesture-generation evaluation, and present a novel proposal for remedying them. Specifically, we announce an upcoming living leaderboard to benchmark progress in conversational motion synthesis. Unlike earlier gesture-generation challenges, the leaderboard will be updated with large-scale user studies of new gesture-generation systems multiple times per year, and systems on the leaderboard can be submitted to any publication venue that their authors prefer. By evolving the leaderboard evaluation data and tasks over time, the effort can keep driving progress towards the most important end goals identified by the community. We actively seek community involvement across the entire evaluation pipeline: from data and tasks for the evaluation, via tooling, to the systems evaluated. In other words, our proposal will not only make it easier for researchers to perform good evaluations, but their collective input and contributions will also help drive the future of gesture-generation research.</description>

      <title>Jointly Generating Multi-view Consistent PBR Textures using Collaborative Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view consistency remains a challenge for image diffusion models. Even within the Text-to-Texture problem, where perfect geometric correspondences are known a priori, many methods fail to yield aligned predictions across views, necessitating non-trivial fusion methods to incorporate the results onto the original mesh. We explore this issue for a Collaborative Control workflow specifically in PBR Text-to-Texture. Collaborative Control directly models PBR image probability distributions, including normal bump maps; to our knowledge, the only diffusion model to directly output full PBR stacks. We discuss the design decisions involved in making this model multi-view consistent, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in ablation studies, as well as practical applications.</description>

      <title>Generating Topologically and Geometrically Diverse Manifold Data in Dimensions Four and Below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the topological characteristics of data is important to many areas of research. Recent work has demonstrated that synthetic 4D image-type data can be useful to train 4D convolutional neural network models to see topological features in these data. These models also appear to tolerate the use of image preprocessing techniques where existing topological data analysis techniques such as persistent homology do not. This paper investigates how methods from algebraic topology, combined with image processing techniques such as morphology, can be used to generate topologically sophisticated and diverse-looking 2-, 3-, and 4D image-type data with topological labels in simulation. These approaches are illustrated in 2D and 3D with the aim of providing a roadmap towards achieving this in 4D.</description>

      <title>Neural Differential Appearance Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to reproduce dynamic appearance textures with space-stationary but time-varying visual statistics. While most previous work decomposes dynamic textures into static appearance and motion, we focus on dynamic appearance that results not from motion but variations of fundamental properties, such as rusting, decaying, melting, and weathering. To this end, we adopt the neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to learn the underlying dynamics of appearance from a target exemplar. We simulate the ODE in two phases. At the "warm-up" phase, the ODE diffuses a random noise to an initial state. We then constrain the further evolution of this ODE to replicate the evolution of visual feature statistics in the exemplar during the generation phase. The particular innovation of this work is the neural ODE achieving both denoising and evolution for dynamics synthesis, with a proposed temporal training scheme. We study both relightable (BRDF) and non-relightable (RGB) appearance models. For both we introduce new pilot datasets, allowing, for the first time, to study such phenomena: For RGB we provide 22 dynamic textures acquired from free online sources; For BRDFs, we further acquire a dataset of 21 flash-lit videos of time-varying materials, enabled by a simple-to-construct setup. Our experiments show that our method consistently yields realistic and coherent results, whereas prior works falter under pronounced temporal appearance variations. A user study confirms our approach is preferred to previous work for such exemplars.</description>

      <title>DSparsE: Dynamic Sparse Embedding for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the incompleteness problem in knowledge graph remains a significant challenge. Current knowledge graph completion methods have their limitations. For example, ComDensE is prone to overfitting and suffers from the degradation with the increase of network depth while InteractE has the limitations in feature interaction and interpretability. To this end, we propose a new method called dynamic sparse embedding (DSparsE) for knowledge graph completion. The proposed model embeds the input entity-relation pairs by a shallow encoder composed of a dynamic layer and a relation-aware layer. Subsequently, the concatenated output of the dynamic layer and relation-aware layer is passed through a projection layer and a deep decoder with residual connection structure. This model ensures the network robustness and maintains the capability of feature extraction. Furthermore, the conventional dense layers are replaced by randomly initialized sparse connection layers in the proposed method, which can mitigate the model overfitting. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on the datasets of FB15k-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10. It was demonstrated that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hits@1 compared to the existing baseline approaches. An ablation study is performed to examine the effects of the dynamic layer and relation-aware layer, where the combined model achieves the best performance.</description>

      <title>Lateral Ventricle Shape Modeling using Peripheral Area Projection for Longitudinal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deformation of the lateral ventricle (LV) shape is widely studied to identify specific morphometric changes associated with diseases. Since LV enlargement is considered a relative change due to brain atrophy, local longitudinal LV deformation can indicate deformation in adjacent brain areas. However, conventional methods for LV shape analysis focus on modeling the solely segmented LV mask. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach using peripheral area projection, which is the first attempt to analyze LV considering its surrounding areas. Our approach matches the baseline LV mesh by deforming the shape of follow-up LVs, while optimizing the corresponding points of the same adjacent brain area between the baseline and follow-up LVs. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluated the deformation of the left LV in normal (n=10) and demented subjects (n=10), and we found that each surrounding area (thalamus, caudate, hippocampus, amygdala, and right LV) projected onto the surface of LV shows noticeable differences between normal and demented subjects.</description>

      <title>TextToon: Real-Time Text Toonify Head Avatar from Single Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose TextToon, a method to generate a drivable toonified avatar. Given a short monocular video sequence and a written instruction about the avatar style, our model can generate a high-fidelity toonified avatar that can be driven in real-time by another video with arbitrary identities. Existing related works heavily rely on multi-view modeling to recover geometry via texture embeddings, presented in a static manner, leading to control limitations. The multi-view video input also makes it difficult to deploy these models in real-world applications. To address these issues, we adopt a conditional embedding Tri-plane to learn realistic and stylized facial representations in a Gaussian deformation field. Additionally, we expand the stylization capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing an adaptive pixel-translation neural network and leveraging patch-aware contrastive learning to achieve high-quality images. To push our work into consumer applications, we develop a real-time system that can operate at 48 FPS on a GPU machine and 15-18 FPS on a mobile machine. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in generating textual avatars over existing methods in terms of quality and real-time animation.

      <title>StopThePop: Sorted Gaussian Splatting for View-Consistent Real-time Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent model for constructing 3D representations from images across diverse domains. However, the efficiency of the 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering pipeline relies on several simplifications. Notably, reducing Gaussian to 2D splats with a single view-space depth introduces popping and blending artifacts during view rotation. Addressing this issue requires accurate per-pixel depth computation, yet a full per-pixel sort proves excessively costly compared to a global sort operation. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical rasterization approach that systematically resorts and culls splats with minimal processing overhead. Our software rasterizer effectively eliminates popping artifacts and view inconsistencies, as demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative measurements. Simultaneously, our method mitigates the potential for cheating view-dependent effects with popping, ensuring a more authentic representation. Despite the elimination of cheating, our approach achieves comparable quantitative results for test images, while increasing the consistency for novel view synthesis in motion. Due to its design, our hierarchical approach is only 4% slower on average than the original Gaussian Splatting. Notably, enforcing consistency enables a reduction in the number of Gaussians by approximately half with nearly identical quality and view-consistency. Consequently, rendering performance is nearly doubled, making our approach 1.6x faster than the original Gaussian Splatting, with a 50% reduction in memory requirements.</description>

      <title>Diffusing Winding Gradients (DWG): A Parallel and Scalable Method for 3D Reconstruction from Unoriented Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method, Diffusing Winding Gradients (DWG), for reconstructing watertight 3D surfaces from unoriented point clouds. Our method exploits the alignment between the gradients of the generalized winding number (GWN) field and globally consistent normals to orient points effectively. Starting with an unoriented point cloud, DWG initially assigns a random normal to each point. It computes the corresponding GWN field and extract a level set whose iso-value is the average GWN values across all input points. The gradients of this level set are then utilized to update the point normals. This cycle of recomputing the GWN field and updating point normals is repeated until the GWN level sets stabilize and their gradients cease to change. Unlike conventional methods, our method does not rely on solving linear systems or optimizing objective functions, which simplifies its implementation and enhances its suitability for efficient parallel execution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of runtime performance. For large-scale models with 10 to 20 million points, our CUDA implementation on an NVIDIA GTX 4090 GPU achieves speeds 30-120 times faster than iPSR, the leading sequential method, tested on a high-end PC with an Intel i9 CPU. Additionally, by employing a screened variant of GWN, DWG demonstrates enhanced robustness against noise and outliers, and proves effective for models with thin structures and real-world inputs with overlapping and misaligned scans.

      <title>FreeAvatar: Robust 3D Facial Animation Transfer by Learning an Expression Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-driven 3D facial animation transfer aims to drive avatars to reproduce the expressions of actors. Existing methods have achieved remarkable results by constraining both geometric and perceptual consistency. However, geometric constraints (like those designed on facial landmarks) are insufficient to capture subtle emotions, while expression features trained on classification tasks lack fine granularity for complex emotions. To address this, we propose \textbf{FreeAvatar}, a robust facial animation transfer method that relies solely on our learned expression representation. Specifically, FreeAvatar consists of two main components: the expression foundation model and the facial animation transfer model. In the first component, we initially construct a facial feature space through a face reconstruction task and then optimize the expression feature space by exploring the similarities among different expressions. Benefiting from training on the amounts of unlabeled facial images and re-collected expression comparison dataset, our model adapts freely and effectively to any in-the-wild input facial images. In the facial animation transfer component, we propose a novel Expression-driven Multi-avatar Animator, which first maps expressive semantics to the facial control parameters of 3D avatars and then imposes perceptual constraints between the input and output images to maintain expression consistency. To make the entire process differentiable, we employ a trained neural renderer to translate rig parameters into corresponding images. Furthermore, unlike previous methods that require separate decoders for each avatar, we propose a dynamic identity injection module that allows for the joint training of multiple avatars within a single network.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein: A Scalable Metric for Heterogeneous Joint Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</description>

      <title>RISE-SDF: a Relightable Information-Shared Signed Distance Field for Glossy Object Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end relightable neural inverse rendering system that achieves high-quality reconstruction of geometry and material properties, thus enabling high-quality relighting. The cornerstone of our method is a two-stage approach for learning a better factorization of scene parameters. In the first stage, we develop a reflection-aware radiance field using a neural signed distance field (SDF) as the geometry representation and deploy an MLP (multilayer perceptron) to estimate indirect illumination. In the second stage, we introduce a novel information-sharing network structure to jointly learn the radiance field and the physically based factorization of the scene. For the physically based factorization, to reduce the noise caused by Monte Carlo sampling, we apply a split-sum approximation with a simplified Disney BRDF and cube mipmap as the environment light representation. In the relighting phase, to enhance the quality of indirect illumination, we propose a second split-sum algorithm to trace secondary rays under the split-sum rendering framework.Furthermore, there is no dataset or protocol available to quantitatively evaluate the inverse rendering performance for glossy objects. To assess the quality of material reconstruction and relighting, we have created a new dataset with ground truth BRDF parameters and relighting results. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in inverse rendering and relighting, with particularly strong results in the reconstruction of highly reflective objects.</description>

      <title>EgoAvatar: Egocentric View-Driven and Photorealistic Full-body Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Immersive VR telepresence ideally means being able to interact and communicate with digital avatars that are indistinguishable from and precisely reflect the behaviour of their real counterparts. The core technical challenge is two fold: Creating a digital double that faithfully reflects the real human and tracking the real human solely from egocentric sensing devices that are lightweight and have a low energy consumption, e.g. a single RGB camera. Up to date, no unified solution to this problem exists as recent works solely focus on egocentric motion capture, only model the head, or build avatars from multi-view captures. In this work, we, for the first time in literature, propose a person-specific egocentric telepresence approach, which jointly models the photoreal digital avatar while also driving it from a single egocentric video. We first present a character model that is animatible, i.e. can be solely driven by skeletal motion, while being capable of modeling geometry and appearance. Then, we introduce a personalized egocentric motion capture component, which recovers full-body motion from an egocentric video. Finally, we apply the recovered pose to our character model and perform a test-time mesh refinement such that the geometry faithfully projects onto the egocentric view. To validate our design choices, we propose a new and challenging benchmark, which provides paired egocentric and dense multi-view videos of real humans performing various motions. Our experiments demonstrate a clear step towards egocentric and photoreal telepresence as our method outperforms baselines as well as competing methods. For more details, code, and data, we refer to our project page.</description>
