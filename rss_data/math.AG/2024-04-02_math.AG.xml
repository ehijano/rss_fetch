      <title>Compact moduli of marked noncommutative cubic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a compact moduli scheme of marked noncommutative cubic surfaces as the GIT moduli scheme of relations of a quiver associated with a full strong exceptional collection on a cubic surface. It is a toric variety containing the configuration space of six points on a plane in general position as a locally closed subvariety, and birationally parametrizes a class of AS-regular $\mathbb{Z}$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Computing a Saito basis from a standard basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe how to compute a Saito basis of a cusp, a plane curve with only one Puiseux pair. Moreover, the 1-forms of the Saito basis that we compute are characterized in terms of their divisorial orders associated to the "cuspidal" divisor of the minimal reduction of singularities of the cusp. We also introduce a new family of analytic invariants for plane curves computed in terms of Saito bases.</description>

      <title>Principal polarizations on products of abelian varieties over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine and generalize the results of K. E. Lauter and E. W. Howe on principal polarizations on products of abelian varieties over finite fields. Firstly, we study the reasons for the absence of an irreducible principal polarization in the isogeny class of the product of an ordinary and a supersingular abelian varieties. Secondly, we provide a necessary condition for the existence of a principal polarization on an abelian variety in the isogeny class of the product of a geometrically simple abelian surface and an elliptic curve. As an application we get that this abelian threefold or its quadratic twist is a Jacobian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This informal note collects key results and open problems on the (co)homology of the Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces of real marked rational curves. The open problems are both of topological nature, aiming to investigate the (co)homology of these spaces further, and of algebraic nature, aiming to describe the structure of the homology of these spaces in operad-like terms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove a refinement of the Katsura theorem on finite groups acting on abelian surfaces such that the quotient is birational to a $K3$ surface. As an application we extend our results on zeta functions of Kummer surfaces to supersingular generalized Kummer surfaces over finite fields of odd degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric study is given for the 4-dimensional Garnier system. By the resolution of indeterminacy, the group of its B\"aklund transformations is lifted to a group of pseudo-isomorphisms between rational varieties obtained from ${\mathbb P}^2 \times {\mathbb P}^2$ by 10 or 21 blow-ups. The root basis is discussed in the N\'eron-Severi bilattices for the space with 10 blow-ups.</description>

We establish that if a non empty open subscheme $X$ of a smooth affine $k$-scheme is $\mathbb{A}^1$-weakly equivalent to $\mathbb{A}^2_{k} \setminus \left\{(0,0) \right\}$, then $X \cong \mathbb{A}^2_{k} \setminus \left\{(0,0) \right\}$ as $k$-varieties for any field $k$ of characteristic $0$.</description>

      <title>A new approach to flatness in categories of sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, many authors have embraced the study of certain properties of modules such as projectivity, injectivity and flatness from an alternative point of view. This way, Durgun has introduced absolutely pure domains of modules as a mean to gauge the extent of the flatness of any given module (so not just to determine whether or not the module is flat). In this paper, we develop a new treatment of the goemetric flatness in categories of sheaves which shed more light on some of its various important aspects. Namely, in terms of this new approach, some classical schemes are characterized, some new results are established and also known ones are generalized.</description>

      <title>A system of hypergeometric differential equations in $m$ variables of rank $p^m$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a hypergeometric series in $m$ variables with $p+(p-1)m$ parameters, which reduces to the generalized hypergeometric series $_pF_{p-1}$ when $m=1$, and to Lauricella's hypergeometric series $F_C$ in $m$ variables when $p=2$. We give a system of hypergeometric differential equations annihilating the series. Under some non-integral conditions on parameters, we give an Euler type integral representation of the series, and linearly independent $p^m$ solutions to this system around a point near to the origin. We show that this system is of rank $p^m$, and determine its singular locus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we derived some consequences to the symmetrization process developed in \cite{Deng23}. This consists a geometric derivation of part of the properties which uniquely determines the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of type $A_n$ as well as an interpretations of the last property by the decomposition theorem of \cite{BBD}. Finally, the relation of geometry of graded nilpotent classes to Parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials is discussed for the purpose of later applications to Zelevinsky's derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2018, Kalck-Yang showed that the singularity categories associated with 3-dimensional Gorenstein quotient singularities are (up to direct summands) triangle equivalent to small cluster categories associated with McKay quivers with potential. We introduce (graded) McKay quivers with potential and generalize Kalck-Yang's theorem to arbitrary dimensions. Moreover, we characterize the singularity categories in the non-Gorenstein case. More generally, singularity categories have a relative variant known as categories of Cohen-Macaulay modules. We also prove the relative variant of the structure theorem.</description>

      <title>Purity and 2-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07692v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For various 2-Calabi-Yau categories $\mathscr{C}$ for which the stack of objects $\mathfrak{M}$ has a good moduli space $p\colon\mathfrak{M}\rightarrow \mathcal{M}$, we establish purity of the mixed Hodge module complex $p_{!}\underline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\mathfrak{M}}$. We do this by using formality in 2CY categories, along with \'etale neighbourhood theorems for stacks, to prove that the morphism $p$ is modelled \'etale-locally by the semisimplification morphism from the stack of modules of a preprojective algebra. Then via the integrality theorem in cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory we prove purity of $p_{!}\underline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\mathfrak{M}}$. It follows that the Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne-Gabber decomposition theorem for the constant sheaf holds for the morphism $p$, despite the possibly very singular and stacky nature of $\mathfrak{M}$. We use this to define cuspidal cohomology for $\mathfrak{M}$, which is conjecturally a complete space of generators for the BPS algebra associated to $\mathscr{C}$.
  We prove purity of the Borel-Moore homology of the moduli stack $\mathfrak{M}$, provided its good moduli space $\mathcal{M}$ is projective, or admits a suitable contracting $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. In particular, when $\mathfrak{M}$ is the moduli stack of Gieseker-semistable sheaves on a K3 surface, this proves a conjecture of Halpern-Leistner. We use these results to moreover prove purity for several stacks of coherent sheaves that do not admit a good moduli space.
  Without the usual assumption that $r$ and $d$ are coprime, we prove that the Borel-Moore homology of the stack of semistable degree $d$ rank $r$ Higgs sheaves is pure and carries a perverse filtration with respect to the Hitchin base, generalising the usual perverse filtration for the Hitchin system to the case of singular stacks of Higgs sheaves.</description>

We also describe the intersection product with Cartier invariant divisors in terms of the combinatorial data. In particular this provides a new way of computing top intersection numbers of invariant Cartier divisors combinatorially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05323v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define an analogue of the Arnold surface for odd degree flexible curves, and we use it to double branch cover $Q$-flexible embeddings, where $Q$-flexible is a condition to be added to the classical notion of a flexible curve. This allows us to obtain a Viro--Zvonilov-type inequality: an upper bound on the number of non-empty ovals of a curve of odd degree. We investigate our method for flexible curves in a quadric to derive a similar bound in two cases. We also digress around a possible definition of non-orientable flexible curves, for which our method still works and a similar inequality holds.</description>

      <title>Local analog of the Deligne-Riemann-Roch isomorphism for line bundles in relative dimension $1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a local analog of the Deligne-Riemann-Roch isomorphism in the case of line bundles and relative dimension $1$. This local analog consists in computation of the class of $12$th power of the determinant central extension of a group ind-scheme $\mathcal G$ by the multiplicative group scheme over $\mathbb Q$ via the product of $2$-cocyles in the second cohomology group. These $2$-cocycles are the compositions of the Contou-Carr\`{e}re symbol with the $\cup$-product of $1$-cocycles. The group ind-scheme $\mathcal G$ represents the functor which assigns to every commutative ring $A$ the group that is the semidirect product of the group $A((t))^*$ of invertible elements of $A((t))$ and the group of continuous $A$-automorphisms of $A$-algebra $A((t))$. The determinant central extension naturally acts on the determinant line bundle on the moduli stack of geometric data (proper quintets). A proper quintet is a collection of a proper family of curves over $\mathop{\rm Spec} A$, a line bundle on this family, a section of this family, a relative formal parameter at the section, a formal trivialization of the bundle at the section that satisfy further conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we concern with the classification of complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 which are produced, as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of certain affine varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}$-fibrations. Such affine varieties or their appropriate weighted projectivizations are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds. We realize that the equations of the key varieties can be described conceptually by Freudenthal triple systems (FTS, for short). The paper consists of two parts. In Part 1, we revisit the general theory of FTS; the main purpose of Part 1 is to derive the conditions of so called strictly regular elements in FTS so as to fit with our description of key varieties. Then, in Part 2, we define several key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds from the conditions of strictly regular elements in FTS. Among other things obtained in Part 2, we show that there exists a $14$-dimensional factorial affine variety $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ of codimension $4$ in an affine $18$-space with only Gorenstein terminal singularities, and we construct examples of prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of No.20544 in [GRDB] as weighted complete intersections of the weighted projectivization of $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(1^{15},2^{2},3)$. We also clarify in Part 2 a relation between $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and the $G_{2}^{(4)}$-cluster variety, which is a key variety for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds constructed in [CD].</description>

Abstract: The aim of this note is twofold. The first is to obtain a characterization of relative constructible sheaves under a natural condition on the parameter space which in particular applies to the study of relative Fourier-Mukai transforms.
  The second is to introduce and study the notions of relative constructible functions and relative Euler-Poincar\'e index. We prove that the relative Euler-Poincar\'e index provides an isomorphism between the Grothendieck group of the derived category of complexes with bounded relative $\mathbb R$-constructible cohomology and the ring of relative constructible functions.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on real algebraic maps which are topologically special generic maps and generalize the canonical projections of the unit spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10646v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Morse functions with exactly two singular points on homotopy spheres and canonical projections of spheres are generalized as special generic maps. A special generic map is, roughly, a smooth map represented as the composition of a smooth surjection onto a manifold whose preimages are diffeomorphic to a unit sphere in the interior of the manifold and single point sets on the boundary with a smooth immersion of codimension $0$.
  This paper constructs real algebraic maps topologically special generic maps whose images are smoothly embedded manifolds.
  We are also interested in construction of explicit and meaningful smooth maps in differential topology and recently ones in real algebraic geometry. This has been an important and difficult problem.
  In such stories, we have previously constructed real algebraic maps topologically regarded as special generic maps. This paper is a kind of additional short remark on such maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting tangency as a limit of two transverse intersections, we obtain a concrete formula to enumerate smooth degree d plane curves tangent to a given line at multiple points with arbitrary order of tangency. One nodal curves with multiple tangencies of any order are enumerated. Also, one cuspidal curves, that are tangent to first order to a given line at multiple points, are enumerated.
  We also present a new way to enumerate curves with one node; it is interpreted as a degeneration of a curve tangent to a given line. That method is extended to enumerate curves with two nodes, and also curves with one tacnode are enumerated. In the final part of the paper, it is shown how this idea can be applied in the setting of stable maps and perform a concrete computation to enumerate rational curves with first order tangency. A large number of low degree cases have been worked out explicitly.</description>

      <title>Variation of the Hausdorff dimension and degenerations of Schottky groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of a Schottky group varies continuously over the moduli space of Schottky groups defined over any complete valued field constructed by Poineau and Turchetti. To obtain this result, we first study the non-Archimedean case in a setting of Berkovich analytic spaces, where we make use of Poincar\'e series. We show that the latter can be extended meromorphically over the complex plane and admit a special value at zero which is a purely topological invariant.
  As an application, we prove results on the asymptotic behavior of the Hausdorff dimension of degenerating families of complex Schottky groups. For certain families, including Schottky reflection groups, we obtain an exact formula for the asymptotic logarithmic decay rate of the Hausdorff dimension. This generalizes a theorem of McMullen.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every irreducible component of the coarse Koll\'ar-Shepherd-Barron and Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of stable log Calabi-Yau surfaces is a finite quotient of a projective toric variety. This verifies a conjecture of Hacking-Keel-Yu. The proof combines tools from log smooth deformation theory, the minimal model program, punctured log Gromov-Witten theory and mirror symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of twisted restricted conformal blocks on totally ramified orbicurves and establish an isomorphism between the space of twisted restricted conformal blocks and the space of twisted conformal blocks. The relationships among twisted (restricted) conformal blocks, $g$-twisted (restricted) correlation functions, and twisted intertwining operators are explored. Furthermore, by introducing a geometric generalization of Zhu's algebra and its modules, we obtain a description of the space of coinvariants by modules over associative algebras and show it is finite-dimensional under some conditions. In particular, a more conceptual proof of the $g$-twisted fusion rules theorem in vertex operator algebra theory is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the properties of the ideal of the coordinate Hermite interpolation on n-dimensional grid [4], we prove that the extension k in k[x1, x2, ..., xn] / (f1(x1), ..., fn(xn)) has a primitive element if and only if at most one of the univariate polynomials f1, ..., fn is inseparable. This result lead to some Corollaries related to the existence of primitive element of finite k-algebras. Finally, these results are further used to investigate the well known Frobenius question, whether two commuting matrices A and B can be expressed as polynomials in some matrix C. More specifically, we identify certain classes of matrices for which matrix C exists and different classes where no such matrix C exists.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Jordan algebras of cubic forms. Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first aim of this paper is to construct a $13$-dimensional affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibration. It is well-known that the affine cone of the Segre embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is defined as the null loci of the so called $\sharp$-mapping of a 9-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Inspired with this fact, we construct $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ in the same way coordinatizing $J$ with 8 parameters. We derive such a coordinatization of $J$ using fixed three complementary primitive idempotents and the associated Peirce decomposition of $J$.
  The second aim of this paper is to construct complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or its subvarieties (possibly allowing some coordinates with weight $0$). The affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ and such weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds. We show that a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-fold of genus $3$ with three $\frac{1}{2}(1,1,1)$-singularities belonging to the class of No.5.4 as in [Tak1] is constructed from one weighted projectivization of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ such that all the coordinates have positive weights. Conversely, we also show that any such a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-fold is obtained in this way. Moreover, relating $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ with the $C_{2}$-cluster variety constructed by Coughlan and Ducat [CD1], we show that weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or its subvarieties are key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds belonging to 108 classes in the online database [GRDB].</description>

Abstract: Subsequent to the previous paper [Tak5], we are concerned with the classification of complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 which are produced, as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of certain affine varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibrations. Such affine varieties or their appropriate weighted projectivizations (possibly allowing some coordinates have weights $0$) are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds.
  The purpose of this paper is to give new constructions of a $14$-dimensional affine variety $\Upsilon_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and a $15$-dimensional affine variety $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{15}$ related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibration, which were constructed and were shown to be key varieties in the papers [Tak3,Tak4] and [Tay]. It is well-known that the affine cone of the Segre embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is defined as the null loci of the so called $\sharp$-mapping of a 9-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Inspired with this fact, we construct $\Upsilon_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and $\Pi_{\mathbb{A}}^{15}$ in the same way coordinatizing $J$ with 9 and 10 parameters, respectively. The coordinatization with $9$ parameters is derived by using a fixed primitive idempotent, and the associated Peirce decomposition. The coordinatization with $10$ parameters is derived from the construction of a quadratic Jordan subalgebra generated by $\sharp$-products of two elements due to Petersson [Pe1].</description>

Abstract: For the purpose of proving the strong openness conjecture of multiplier ideal sheaves, Jonsson-Musta\c{t}\u{a} posed an enhanced conjecture and proved the two-dimensional case, which says that: the Lebesgue measure of the set $\big\{c_o^F(\psi)\psi-\log|F|&lt;\log r\big\}$ divided by $r^2$ has a uniform positive lower bound independent of $r$, for a plurisubharmonic function $\psi$ and a holomorphic function $F$ near the origin $o$. Jonsson-Musta\c{t}\u{a}'s conjecture was proved by Guan-Zhou depending on the truth of the strong openness conjecture. However, it is still a question whether one can prove Jonsson-Musta\c{t}\u{a}'s conjecture without using the strong openness property, and obtain a sharp effectiveness result for this conjecture.
  In this article, we use an $L^2$ method with the weight functions $\psi-\log|F|$ and firstly consider a module at at a boundary point of the sublevel sets of a plurisubharmonic function. By studying the minimal $L^{2}$ integrals on the sublevel sets of a plurisubharmonic function with respect to the module at the boundary point, we establish a concavity property of the minimal $L^{2}$ integrals. As applications, we obtain a sharp effectiveness result related to Jonsson-Musta\c{t}\u{a}'s conjecture, which completes the approach from the conjecture to the strong openness property. We also obtain a strong openness property of the module and a lower semi-continuity property with respect to the module.</description>

Abstract: Let $d\geq 1$ be an integer and let $p$ be a rational prime. Recall that $p$ is a torsion prime of degree $d$ if there exists an elliptic curve $E$ over a degree $d$ number field $K$ such that $E$ has a $K$-rational point of order $p$. Derickx, Kamienny, Stein and Stoll have computed the torsion primes of degrees 4, 5, 6 and 7; we verify that these techniques can be extended to determine the torsion primes of degree 8.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variation operator in singularity theory maps relative homology cycles to compact cycles in the Milnor fiber using the monodromy. We construct its symplectic analogue for an isolated singularity. We define a new Floer cohomology, called monodromy Lagrangian Floer cohomology, which provides categorifications of the standard theorems on the variation operator and the Seifert form. The key ingredients are a special class $\Gamma$ in the symplectic cohomology of the inverse of the monodromy and its closed-open images. For isolated plane curve singularities whose A'Campo divide has depth zero, we find an exceptional collection consisting of non-compact Lagrangians in the Milnor fiber corresponding to a distinguished collection of vanishing cycles under the variation operator.</description>

      <title>Reality conditions for the KdV equation and exact quasi-periodic solutions in finite phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper reality conditions for quasi-periodic solutions of the KdV equation are determined completely. As a result, solutions in the form of non-linear waves can be plotted and investigated.
  The full scope of obtaining finite-gap solutions of the KdV equation is presented. It is proven that the multiply periodic $\wp_{1,1}$-function on the Jacobian variety of a hyperelliptic curve of arbitrary genus serves as the finite-gap solution, the genus coincides with the number of gaps. The subspace of the Jacobian variety where $\wp_{1,1}$, as well as other $\wp$-functions, are bounded and real-valued is found in any genus. This result covers every finite phase space of the KdV hierarchy, and can be extended to other completely integrable equations. A method of effective computation of this type of solutions is suggested, and illustrated in genera $2$ and $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local heights are arithmetic invariants used in the quadratic Chabauty method for determining the rational points on curves. We present an algorithm to compute these local heights for hyperelliptic curves at odd primes $\ell\neq p$. This algorithm significantly broadens the applicability of quadratic Chabauty to curves which were previously inaccessible due to the presence of non-trivial local heights. We provide numerous examples, including the first quadratic Chabauty computation for a curve having two primes with non-trivial local heights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of framed quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities parameterized by a decorated marked surface with punctures (DMSp), where simple zeros, double poles and higher order poles respectively correspond to decorations, punctures and boundary components. We show that the fundamental group of this space equals the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi map from the surface mapping class group of DMSp to the first homology group of the marked surface (without decorations/punctures). Moreover, a universal cover of this space is given by the space of stability conditions on the associated 3-Calabi-Yau category. Furthermore, when we partial compactify and orbifold this moduli space by allowing the collision of simple zeros and some of the double poles, the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the deformed (with respect to those collidable double poles) 3-Calabi-Yau category.</description>

Abstract: For a commutative Gorenstein Noetherian ring $R$, we construct an affine scheme $X$ solely from DG singularity category $S_{dg}(R)$ of $R$ such that there is a finite surjective morphism $X \rightarrow \mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$, where $\mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$ is the singular locus in $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. As an application, for two such rings with equivalent DG singularity categories, we prove that the singular loci in their affine schemes have the same dimension.</description>
