      <title>On the absence of quantitatively critical measure equivalence couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a measure equivalence coupling between two finitely generated groups, Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera have found explicit upper bounds on how integrable the associated cocycles can be. These bounds are optimal in many cases but the integrability of the cocycles with respect to these critical thresholds remained unclear. For instance, a cocycle from $\mathbb{Z}^{k+\ell}$ to $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$ can be $\mathrm{L}^p$ for all $p&lt;\frac{k}{k+\ell}$ but not for $p&gt;\frac{k}{k+\ell}$, and the case $p=\frac{k}{k+\ell}$ was an open question which we answer by the negative. Our main result actually yields much more examples where the integrability threshold given by Delabie-Koivisto-Le Ma\^itre-Tessera Theorems cannot be reached.</description>

      <title>Ordinals arising as residual finiteness depths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every natural number $n$, there exist finitely presented groups with residual finiteness depths $\omega\cdot n$ and $\omega\cdot n + 1$. The ordinals that arise as the residual finiteness depth of a finitely generated group (equivalently, a countable group) are $0,\, 1$, the countable limit ordinals, and the successors of these limit ordinals.</description>

      <title>Iwip endomorphisms of free groups and fixed points of graph selfmaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02924v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a paper from 2011, Jiang, Wang and Zhang studied the fixed points and fixed subgroups of selfmaps on a connected finite graph or a connected compact hyperbolic surface $X$. In particular, for any selfmap $f: X\to X$, they proved that a certain quantity defined in terms of the characteristic $\chr(f, \F)$ and the index $\ind(f, \F)$ of a fixed point class $\F$ of $f$ is bounded below by $2\chi(X)$, where $\chi(X)$ is the Euler characteristic of $X$. In this paper, we give a sufficient condition for when equality holds and hence we partially answer a question of Jiang, by studying iwip outer endomorphisms of free groups acting on stable trees.</description>

      <title>On the BCI Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. The BCI problem asks whether two Haar graphs of $G$ are isomorphic if and only if they are isomorphic by an element of an explicit list of isomorphisms. We first generalize this problem in a natural way and give a theoretical way to solve the isomorphism problem for the natural generalization. We then restrict our attention to abelian groups and, with an exception, reduce the problem to the isomorphism problem for a related quotient, component, or corresponding Cayley digraph. For Haar graphs of an abelian group of odd order with connection sets $S$ those of Cayley graphs (i.e. $S = -S$), the exception does not exist. For Haar graphs of cyclic groups of odd order with connection sets those of a Cayley graph, among others, we solve the isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Symmetrized pseudofunction algebras from $L^p$-representations and amenability of locally compact groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show via an application of techniques from complex interpolation theory how the $L^p$-pseudofunction algebras of a locally compact group $G$ can be understood as sitting between $L^1(G)$ and $C^*(G)$. Motivated by this, we collect and review various characterizations of group amenability connected to the $p$-pseudofunction algebra of Herz and generalize these to the symmetrized setting. Along the way, we describe the Banach space dual of the symmetrized pseudofuntion algebras on $G$ associated with representations on reflexive Banach spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group with simply connected derived subgroup. Over the complex numbers there exists a local method to study the geometric properties of a point $g$ in the closure of a Jordan class of $G$ in terms of Jordan classes of a maximal rank reductive subgroup $M \leq G$ depending on the point $g$, and further to the closures of certain decomposition classes in Lie($M$). We adapt this method to the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$, and we give sufficient restrictions on $p$ for it to hold.</description>

      <title>Edge subdivisions and the $L^2$-homology of right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $L$ is a flag triangulation of $S^{n-1}$, then the Davis complex $\Sigma_L$ for the associated right-angled Coxeter group $W_L$ is a contractible $n$-manifold. A special case of a conjecture of Singer predicts that the $L^2$-homology of such $\Sigma_L$ vanishes outside the middle dimension. We give conditions which guarantee this vanishing is preserved under edge subdivision of $L$. In particular, we verify Singer's conjecture when $L$ is the barycentric subdivision of the boundary of an $n$-simplex, and for general barycentric subdivisions of triangulations of $S^{2n-1}$. Using this, we construct explicit counterexamples to a torsion growth analogue of Singer's conjecture.</description>

      <title>The cancellation property for projective modules over integral group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a partial classification of the finite groups $G$ for which the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ has projective cancellation, i.e. for which $P \oplus \mathbb{Z} G \cong Q \oplus \mathbb{Z} G$ implies $P \cong Q$ for projective $\mathbb{Z} G$-modules $P$ and $Q$. In particular, we determine when projective cancellation holds for a finite group with no exceptional binary polyhedral quotients. To do this, we prove a cancellation theorem based on a relative version of the Eichler condition. We then use a group theoretic argument to precisely determine the class of groups not covered by this result. The final classification is then obtained by applying results of Swan, Chen and Bley-Hofmann-Johnston which show failure of projective cancellation for certain groups.</description>

      <title>Zariski dense non-tempered subgroups in higher rank of nearly optimal growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first example of a Zariski dense discrete non-lattice subgroup $\Gamma_0$ of a higher rank simple Lie group $G$, which is non-tempered in the sense that the associated quasi-regular representation $L^2(\Gamma_0\backslash G)$ is non-tempered. In fact, let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic $n$-manifold with properly embedded totally geodesic hyperplane for $n\ge 3$. We prove that there exists a non-empty open subset $\cal O$ of $\rm{Hom}(\Gamma, \rm{SO}(n,2))$ such that for any $\sigma\in \mathcal O$, the image $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is a Zariski dense and non-tempered Anosov subgroup of $\rm{SO}(n,2)$. Moreover the growth indicator of $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is nearly optimal, that is, it almost realizes the supremum of growth indicators of all non-lattice discrete subgroups given by property $(T)$ of $\rm{SO}(n,2)$.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras of Thompson-like Groups from Cloning Systems II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(G_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of groups equipped with a $d$-ary cloning system and denote by $\mathscr{T}_d(G_*)$ the resulting Thompson-like group. In previous work joint with Zaremsky, we obtained structural results concerning the group von Neumann algebra of $\mathscr{T}_d(G_*)$, denoted by $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$. Under some natural assumptions on the $d$-ary cloning system, we proved that $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type $\text{II}_1$ factor. With a few additional natural assumptions, we proved that $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is, moreover, a McDuff factor. In this paper, we further analyze the structure of $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, in particular the inclusion $L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, where $F_d$ is the smallest of the Higman--Thompson groups. We prove that if the $d$-ary cloning system is ``diverse," then $L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ satisfies the weak asymptotic homomorphism property. As a consequence, the inclusion is irreducible, which is a considerable improvement of our result that $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type $\text{II}_1$ factor, and the inclusion is also singular. Then we look at examples of non-diverse $d$-ary cloning systems with respect to the weak asymptotic homomorphism property, singularity, and irreducibility. Then we finish the paper with some applications. We construct a machine which takes in an arbitrary group and finite group and produces an inclusion (both finite and infinite index) of type $\text{II}_1$ factors which is singular but without the weak asymptotic homomorphism property. Finally, using irreducibility of the inclusion $L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, our conditions for when $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a McDuff factor, and the fact that Higman-Thompson groups $F_d$ are character rigid (in the sense of Peterson), we prove that the groups $F_d$ are McDuff (in the sense of Deprez-Vaes).</description>

      <title>Arithmeticity, thinness and efficiency of qutrit Clifford+T gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Clifford+T gate set is a topological generating set for PU(2), which has been well-studied from the perspective of quantum computation on a single qubit. The discovery that it generates a full S-arithmetic subgroup of PU(2) has led to a fruitful interaction between quantum computation and number theory, resulting in a proof that words in these gates cover PU(2) in an almost-optimal manner.
  In this paper we study the analogue gate set for PU(3). We show that in PU(3) the group generated by the Clifford+T gates is not arithmetic - in fact, it is a thin matrix group, namely a Zariski-dense group of infinite index in its ambient S-arithmetic group. On the other hand, we study a recently proposed extension of the Clifford+T gates, called Clifford+D, and show that these do generate a full S-arithmetic subgroup of PU(3), and satisfy a slightly weaker almost-optimal covering property than that of Clifford+T in PU(2). The proofs are different from those for PU(2): while both gate sets act naturally on a (Bruhat-Tits) tree, in PU(2) the generated group acts transitively on the vertices of the tree, and this is a main ingredient in proving both arithmeticity and efficiency. In the PU(3) Clifford+D case the action on the tree is far from being transitive. This makes the proof of arithmeticity considerably harder, and the study of efficiency by automorphic representation theory becomes more involved, and results in a covering rate which differs from the optimal one by a factor of $log_3(105)\approx 4.236$.</description>

Abstract: We show that for each $n \geq 2$, the systoles of closed hyperbolic $n$-manifolds form a dense subset of $(0, +\infty)$. We also show that for any $n\geq 2$ and any Salem number $\lambda$, there is a closed arithmetic hyperbolic $n$-manifold of systole $\log(\lambda)$. In particular, the Salem conjecture holds if and only if the systoles of closed arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds in some (any) dimension fail to be dense in $(0, +\infty)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tambara functors are the analogue of commutative rings in equivariant algebra. Nakaoka defined ideals in Tambara functors, leading to the definition of the Nakaoka spectrum of prime ideals in a Tambara functor. In this work, we continue the study of the Nakoaka spectra of Tambara functors. We describe, in terms of the Zariski spectra of ordinary commutative rings, the Nakaoka spectra of many Tambara functors. In particular: we identify the Nakaoka spectrum of the fixed point Tambara functor of any $G$-ring with the GIT quotient of its classical Zariski spectrum; we describe the Nakaoka spectrum of the complex representation ring Tambara functor over a cyclic group of prime order $p$; we describe the affine line (the Nakaoka spectra of free Tambara functors on one generator) over a cyclic group of prime order $p$ in terms of the Zariski spectra of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, $\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$, and the ring of cyclic polynomials $\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_{p-1}]^{C_p}$. To obtain these results, we introduce a "ghost construction" which produces an integral extension of any $C_p$-Tambara functor, the Nakaoka spectrum of which is describable. To relate the Nakaoka spectrum of a Tambara functor to that of its ghost, we prove several new results in equivariant commutative algebra, including a weak form of the Hilbert basis theorem, going up, lying over, and levelwise radicality of prime ideals in Tambara functors. These results also allow us to compute the Krull dimensions of many Tambara functors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Wilson conjecture for $\omega$-categorical $3$-Engel Lie algebras over a field of characteristic $5$: every $\omega$-categorical Lie algebra over $\mathbb{F}_5$ which satisfies the identity $[x,y^3] = 0$ is nilpotent. We also include an extended introduction to Wilson's conjecture: \textit{every $\omega$-categorical locally nilpotent $p$-group is nilpotent}, and present variants of this conjecture and connections to local/global nilpotency problems (Burnside, Kurosh-Levitzki, Engel groups). No particular knowledge of model theory is assumed except basic notions of formulas and definable sets.</description>
