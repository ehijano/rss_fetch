      <title>LatentChem: From Textual CoT to Latent Thinking in Chemical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical large language models (LLMs) predominantly rely on explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in natural language to perform complex reasoning. However, chemical reasoning is inherently continuous and structural, and forcing it into discrete linguistic tokens introduces a fundamental representation mismatch that constrains both efficiency and performance. We introduce LatentChem, a latent reasoning interface that decouples chemical computation from textual generation, enabling models to perform multi-step reasoning directly in continuous latent space while emitting language only for final outputs. Remarkably, we observe a consistent emergent behavior: when optimized solely for task success, models spontaneously internalize reasoning, progressively abandoning verbose textual derivations in favor of implicit latent computation. This shift is not merely stylistic but computationally advantageous. Across diverse chemical reasoning benchmarks, LatentChem achieves a 59.88\% non-tie win rate over strong CoT-based baselines on ChemCoTBench, while delivering a 10.84$\times$ average inference speedup. Our results provide empirical evidence that chemical reasoning is more naturally and effectively realized as continuous latent dynamics rather than discretized linguistic trajectories.</description>

      <title>Electron-Informed Coarse-Graining Molecular Representation Learning for Real-World Molecular Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various representation learning methods for molecular structures have been devised to accelerate data-driven chemistry. However, the representation capabilities of existing methods are essentially limited to atom-level information, which is not sufficient to describe real-world molecular physics. Although electron-level information can provide fundamental knowledge about chemical compounds beyond the atom-level information, obtaining the electron-level information in real-world molecules is computationally impractical and sometimes infeasible. We propose a method for learning electron-informed molecular representations without additional computation costs by transferring readily accessible electron-level information about small molecules to large molecules of our interest. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on extensive benchmark datasets containing experimentally observed molecular physics. The source code for HEDMoL is available at https://github.com/ngs00/HEDMoL.</description>

      <title>tmQM-RDF Dataset: a Knowledge Graph Representing Transition Metal Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition Metal Complexes (TMCs) have wide-ranging practical utility in chemistry, with possible applications that range from catalysis to medicinal chemistry. The study of TMCs and their properties is thus a field rich with potential, one in which machine learning and computational approaches can offer a substantial aid. For this reason, appropriate and accessible datasets, collecting a wide range of information, are required in order to facilitate the effective analysis and investigation of such compounds. This paper contributes to the data modelling effort via the introduction of the transition metal quantum mechanics RDF (tmQM-RDF) dataset, a knowledge graph constructed using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary which collects rich and detailed descriptions of approximately 50k TMCs. These descriptions are both qualitative and quantitative in nature, encompassing the compositional nature of TMCs in terms of their constituting ligands, as well as the entirety of their molecular graphs. An example of the power of the proposed representation is presented, showcasing how the information available in tmQM-RDF can be exploited for TMC manipulation tasks, achieving promising performance even with relatively simple probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>Efficient, Equivariant Predictions of Distributed Charge Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine learning (ML) based equivariant neural network for constructing distributed charge models (DCMs) of arbitrary resolution, DCM-net, is presented. DCMs efficiently and accurately model the anisotropy of the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and go beyond the point charge representation used in conventional molecular mechanics (MM) energy functions. This is particularly relevant for capturing the conformational dependence of the ESP (internal polarization) and chemically relevant features such as lone pairs or {\sigma}-holes. Across conformational space, the learned charge positions from DCM-net are stable and continuous. Across the QM9 chemical space, two-charge-per-atom models achieve accuracies comparable to fitted atomic dipoles for previously unseen molecules (0.75 (kcal/mol)/e). Three- and four-charge-per-atom models reach accuracies competitive with atomistic multipole expansions up to quadrupole level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e). Pronounced improvements of the ESP are found around O and F atoms, both of which are known to feature strongly anisotropic fields, and for aromatic systems. Across the QM9 reference data set, molecular dipole moments improve by 0.1 D compared with fitted monopoles. Transfer learning on dipeptides yields a 0.2 (kcal/mol)/e ESP improvement for unseen samples and a two-fold MAE reduction for molecular dipole moments versus fitted monopoles. Overall, DCM-net offers a fast and physically meaningful approach to generating distributed charge models for running pure ML or mixed ML/MM based molecular simulations. level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e).</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Pauli Repulsion, Electrostatics, and Field Inhomogeneity for Blueshifting and Redshifting Vibrational Probe Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many molecules' vibrational frequencies are sensitive to intermolecular electric fields, enabling them to probe the field in complex molecular environments. However, it is often unclear whether the probe is responding to the local electric field or other types of intermolecular interactions, inhibiting interpretation of the frequency and effectiveness as probes. This is especially true of molecules whose vibrational frequencies blueshift instead of the more typical redshift in hydrogen bonding configurations. Here we computationally investigate the causes of redshifting versus blueshifting over a range of vibrational reporters. First, we apply adiabatic energy decomposition analysis to a paradigmatic set of probes, finding that redshifting only occurs when electrostatic interactions are strong enough to overcome the dominant and large blueshifting contribution of Pauli repulsion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that field inhomogeneity can further shift the frequency of many probes substantially to either reinforce or counteract the shift expected from a homogeneous field. We find that redshifting is reinforced by electric field inhomogeneity, otherwise field inhomogeneity further weakens the electrostatic contribution relative to Pauli repulsion, leading to blueshifting. Further calculations indicate that the probe's response to field inhomogeneity can be understood by considering the mass of the atoms involved in the stretching mode and sign of the electric field. In explaining the interplay of different intermolecular interactions and field inhomogeneity for many probes, our results should enable the use and interpretation of spectroscopic probes and their connection to electric fields in more complex systems.</description>

      <title>Charge Transfer with a Spin. I: A Generalized CASSCF Framework for Investigating Charge Transfer in the Presence of Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized extension of the recently developed electron/hole-transfer Dynamically-weighted State-Averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method to model charge transfer in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for systems containing an odd number of electrons. Our approach incorporates complex-valued spinor orbitals and incorporates four electronic configurations in describing ground-excited state curve crossings between Kramers-restricted doublet states. The method achieves smooth potential energy surfaces and rapid self-consistent field (SCF) convergence across a wide range of spin-orbit coupling strengths, providing an efficient framework for investigating charge transfer processes in the presence of nontrivial spin degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Charge Transfer with a Spin. II: A Framework for Diabatization which Localizes Charge and Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a diabatization procedure that localizes charges (in real space) and localizes spins (in spin space) for open-shell systems that exhibit charge transfer in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The procedure is applied to a two-state crossing between pairs of Kramers-restricted doublet states (which can also be considered effectively a four-state crossing). To generate the relevant electronic states, we employ the recently developed electron/hole-transfer Dynamically-weighted State-Averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method that treats systems with an odd number of electrons. To generate the relevant diabatic states, we employ a two-step optimization over complex-unitary rotations that sequentially maximizes dipole and spin moments through iterative Jacobi sweeps; the resulting update rules are effectively equivalent to those of approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) applied to charge and spin. The method converges rapidly and yields smooth diabatic potential energy surfaces that preserve dipole and spin properties (e.g., a slowly varying pseudospin texture) along the reaction coordinate while maintaining time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Influence of octupole field on quadrupole mass filter performance in the second stability zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial asymmetry in a quadrupole mass filter (QMF), introduced by symmetric displacement of a diagonally opposite rod pair, modifies the confinement potential and alters the ion stability characteristics. In this work, the influence of such radial asymmetry on QMF operation in the second stability zone is investigated through simulations. Using an existing potential formulation for a radially asymmetric QMF, the stability diagram in the second stability zone is extracted for the first time, revealing a systematic shift of the stability apex with the asymmetry parameter. Radial asymmetry introduces additional multipole components, notably an octupole term whose magnitude scales with the asymmetry parameter and whose sign depends on the DC polarity applied to the displaced rods. Transmission simulations show that the transmission peak shifts in accordance with the displaced stability apex, while the resolution exhibits a strong dependence on both the asymmetry parameter and the DC polarity. Comparable maximum resolution is obtained for inward and outward displacements under suitable polarity configurations, with outward displacement providing higher transmission efficiency due to an increased effective aperture. These results demonstrate that controlled radial asymmetry provides an effective means to tailor the resolution and transmission characteristics of QMFs operating in the second stability zone.</description>

      <title>Colloidal logic-gate circuits can process environmental signals and autonomously perform tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative collective dynamics is a principal determinant of the ability of synthetic micromotors to perform specific functions. However, realizing controllable and predictable collective behavior in complex physiological environments remains a significant challenge. Here, we show that collections of enzyme-coated colloids can be designed as various chemical logic gates, which subsequently can be organized into functional logic circuits. These circuits take environmental information as input signals and process it to produce output chemical species needed to achieve specific goals. The chemical computation performed by the circuit endows the active colloidal system with the ability to sense its surroundings and autonomously coordinate its collective motion. The results of simulations of several examples are presented, where self-assembled colloidal circuits can identify invasive threats by their signals, produce and deliver chemicals to the targets to suppress their activity. The results of this work can aid in the design of experimental chemical logic circuits through micromotor self-assembly that autonomously respond to environmental cues to execute specific tasks.</description>

      <title>Event-Chain Monte Carlo: The global-balance breakthrough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The seminal 2009 paper by Bernard, Krauth, and Wilson marked a paradigm shift in Monte Carlo sampling. By abandoning the restrictive condition of detailed balance in favor of the more fundamental principle of global balance, they introduced the Event-Chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) algorithm, which achieves rejection-free, deterministic sampling for hard spheres. This breakthrough demonstrated that persistent, directional dynamics could dramatically accelerate equilibration in dense particle systems. In this commentary, we review this foundational work and elucidate its underlying mechanism using the broader Event-Driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) framework developed in subsequent years. We show how the original hard-sphere concept naturally generalizes to continuous potentials and modern lifted Markov chain formalisms, transforming a surprising specific result into a powerful general class of sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scalable Preconditioners for the Pseudo-4D DFN Lithium-ion Battery Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pseudo-4D Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model enables predictive simulation of lithium-ion batteries with three-dimensional electrode architectures and particle-scale diffusion, extending the standard pseudo-2D (P2D) formulation to fully resolve cell geometry. This leads to large, nonlinear systems with strong coupling across multiple physical scales, posing significant challenges for scalable numerical solution. We introduce block-structured preconditioning strategies that exploit the mathematical properties of the coupled system, employing multigrid techniques for electrode-level operators and localized solvers for particle-scale diffusion. Comprehensive scalability studies are performed across a range of geometries, including homogeneous and heterogeneous cubic cells, flattened jelly-roll configurations, and triply periodic minimal surface electrodes, to assess solver robustness and parallel scalability. The proposed methods consistently deliver efficient convergence and enable the solution of battery models with hundreds of millions of degrees of freedom on large-scale parallel hardware.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Band Gaps in Ensemble Density Functional Theory using Thermodynamic Limits of Finite One-Dimensional Model Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a promising extension to Density Functional Theory (DFT) for calculating excited states. While Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences underestimate gaps, EDFT has been shown to provide more accurate excitation energies in atoms, molecules and isolated model systems. However, it is unclear whether EDFT is capable of calculating band gaps of periodic systems -- and what an appropriate theoretical formulation would be to describe periodic systems. We explored how EDFT could calculate band gaps by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly wide finite versions of the one-dimensional Kronig-Penney (KP) periodic model. We use Octopus, an ab initio, open-source, real-space DFT code, as in our previous work [R. J. Leano et al., Electron. Struct. 6, 035003 (2024)] in which we found with "particle in a box" models that EDFT can provide a reasonable effective mass correction for the homogeneous electron gas. Now, we use a periodic reference that is gapped. We find that the finite systems' Kohn-Sham gap approaches the same periodic limit for each of three ways of terminating the finite system, though the appropriate states corresponding to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum have to be carefully identified in each case. Finally, our EDFT results, using a simple ensemblized LDA approximation, have a reasonable nonzero correction to the bandgap in the periodic limit. The results indicate that EDFT is promising for periodic systems, to motivate further work on developing a suitable formalism.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a lithium dip in ~35 Myr "Snake" Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a lithium dip (Li-dip) in the stellar "Snake" (age = $35 \pm 5$ Myr), challenging the classical view that Li-dips emerge only at ages $\gtrsim 150$ Myr. Using high-resolution spectra from GALAH DR4 ($R \sim 28,000$) for 211 member stars, we identify a clear depletion feature in a $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ range of 6200--6800 K with a depth of $\Delta A(\mathrm{Li}) \approx 0.40$ dex. Our analysis reveals two key advances: the Li-dip appears $\gtrsim 100$ Myr earlier than the previous observations, and within the dip temperature range, a significant correlation is found between rotational velocity and lithium depletion. Specifically, fast rotators ($v \sin i &gt; 25$ km s$^{-1}$) exhibit stronger lithium depletion than slow rotators ($v \sin i &lt; 25$ km s$^{-1}$). This trend suggests that faster rotators develop stronger rotational shear at the convective-radiative boundary, which enhances turbulent mixing and accelerates lithium destruction. It is also found that the lower temperature edge of the lithium plateau can reach as low as 5500 K for the young open clusters.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the plasmon-pole and multipole approximations in the Yambo Code using the GW100 dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verification and validation of electronic structure codes are essential to ensure reliable and reproducible results in computational materials science. While density functional theory has been extensively benchmarked, systematic assessments of many-body perturbation theory methods such as the GW approximation have only recently emerged, most notably through the GW100 dataset. In this work, we assess the numerical accuracy and convergence behavior of the GW implementation in the yambo code using both the Godby-Needs plasmon-pole model and the recently introduced multipole approximation. Quasiparticle energies are compared against GW100 reference data to evaluate the performance, numerical stability, and consistency of these approaches.</description>

      <title>Proton Quantum Effects on Electronic Excitation in Hydrogen-bonded Organic Solid: A First-Principles Green's Function Theory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear quantum effects of protons on electronic excitations in hydrogen-bonded organic materials remains underexplored. In theoretical studies, modeling excitons in these extended systems is particularly difficult because they tend to have a large exciton binding energy and sometimes exhibit charge transfer character. We demonstrate how first-principles Green's function theory combined with the nuclear-electronic orbital method enables us to examine the nature of excitons in a prototypical organic solid of eumelanin, for which the extensive hydrogen bonds have been proposed to facilitate the formation of delocalized excitons. We investigate how the quantization of protons impacts electronic excitations. We discuss the extent to which the resulting proton quantum effects can be described as being derived from structure and how they induce molecular-level anisotropy for the excitons in the organic solid.</description>

Abstract: Entropy is critically examined as a fundamental concept in contemporary science and informatics. Although the typical Shannon entropy provides a proper framework for describing the canonical ensemble, it fails to represent adequately the microcanonical ensemble. This discrepancy manifests additionally in its inability to support a theoretical derivation of the Second Law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Doubling the size of quantum selected configuration interaction based on seniority-zero space and its application to QC-QSCI-AFQMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose doubly occupied configuration interaction-quantum selected configuration interaction (DOCI-QSCI), which samples from the seniority-zero space. While the use of this space effectively doubles the qubit budget, equaling the number of spatial orbitals, this sector restriction can compromise quantitative accuracy. To compensate for this, we expand sampled bitstrings via their Cartesian product into a larger space that includes seniority-breaking determinants. The resulting wave function is also proposed using the trial state in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) to recover dynamical correlations across the full orbital space (DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC). We evaluate the proposed methods on the H6 chain, N2 dissociation, and the addition of singlet O2 to a BODIPY dye. For the H6 chain, DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC reproduces the accuracy of the level of the complete-active-space counterpart with the quantum device ibm kobe. For N2 and BODIPY-O2, with (14e, 28o) and up to (20e, 20o) active spaces, it yields reasonable results, whereas single-reference CCSD(T) fails qualitatively. These results demonstrate that the DOCI-QSCI doubles the orbital space accessible to conventional QSCI and subsequent ph-AFQMC post-processing delivers reasonably high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spinor Double-Quantum Excitation in the Solution NMR of Near-Equivalent Spin-1/2 Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of double-quantum excitation schemes is described for the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of near-equivalent spin-1/2 pairs. These new methods exploit the spinor behaviour of 2-level systems, whose signature is the change of sign of a quantum state upon a $2\pi$ rotation. The spinor behaviour is used to manipulate the phases of single-quantum coherences, in order to prepare a double-quantum precursor state which is rapidly converted into double-quantum coherence by a straightforward $\pi/2$ rotation. One set of spinor-based methods exploits symmetry-based pulse sequences, while the other set exploits SLIC (spin-lock-induced crossing), in which the nutation frequency under a resonant radiofrequency field is matched to the spin-spin coupling. A variant of SLIC is introduced which is well-compensated for deviations in the radiofrequency field amplitude. The methods are demonstrated by performing double-quantum-filtered $^{19}$F NMR on a molecular system containing a pair of diastereotopic $^{19}$F nuclei. The new methods are compared with existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Cutting Through the Noise: On-the-fly Outlier Detection for Robust Training of Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of machine learning interatomic potentials suffers from reference data that contains numerical noise. Often originating from unconverged or inconsistent electronic-structure calculations, this noise is challenging to identify. Existing mitigation strategies such as manual filtering or iterative refinement of outliers, require either substantial expert effort or multiple expensive retraining cycles, making them difficult to scale to large datasets. Here, we introduce an on-the-fly outlier detection scheme that automatically down-weights noisy samples, without requiring additional reference calculations. By tracking the loss distribution via an exponential moving average, this unsupervised method identifies outliers throughout a single training run. We show that this approach prevents overfitting and matches the performance of iterative refinement baselines with significantly reduced overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by recovering accurate physical observables for liquid water from unconverged reference data, including diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, we validate its scalability by training a foundation model for organic chemistry on the SPICE dataset, where it reduces energy errors by a factor of three. This framework provides a simple, automated solution for training robust models on imperfect datasets across dataset sizes.</description>

      <title>Error compensation without a time penalty: robust spin-lock-induced crossing in solution NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A modification of the widely-used spin-lock-induced crossing (SLIC) procedure is proposed for the solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of strongly coupled nuclear spin systems, including singlet NMR and parahydrogen-enhanced hyperpolarised NMR experiments. The compensated-SLIC (cSLIC) scheme uses a repetitive sequence where the repeated element employs two different radiofrequency field amplitudes. Effective compensation for deviations in the radiofrequency field amplitude is achieved without increasing the overall duration of the SLIC sequence. The advantageous properties of cSLIC are demonstrated by numerical simulations and by representative experiments.</description>

      <title>Reducing Weighted Ensemble Variance With Optimal Trajectory Management</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weighted ensemble (WE) is an enhanced path-sampling method that is conceptually simple, widely applicable, and statistically exact. In a WE simulation, an ensemble of trajectories is periodically pruned or replicated to enhance sampling of rare transitions and improve estimation of mean first passage times (MFPTs). However, poor choices of the parameters governing pruning and replication can lead to high-variance MFPT estimates. Our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 014108 (2023)] presented an optimal WE parameterization strategy and applied it in low-dimensional example systems. The strategy harnesses estimated local MFPTs from different initial configurations to a single target state. In the present work, we apply the optimal parameterization strategy to more challenging, high-dimensional molecular models, namely, synthetic molecular dynamics (MD) models of Trp-cage folding and unfolding, as well as atomistic MD models of NTL9 folding in high-friction and low-friction continuum solvents. In each system we use WE to estimate the MFPT for folding or unfolding events. We show that the optimal parameterization reduces the variance of MFPT estimates in three of four systems, with dramatic improvement in the most challenging atomistic system. Overall, the parameterization strategy improves the accuracy and reliability of WE estimates for the kinetics of biophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Vibrational frequencies and stark tuning rate with continuum electro-chemical models and grand canonical density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating electrochemical interfaces using density functional theory (DFT) requires incorporating the effects of electrochemical potential. The electrochemical potential acts as a new degree of freedom that can effectively tune DFT results as electrochemistry does. Typically, this is implemented by adjusting the number of electrons on the solid surface within the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation, under the framework of an implicit solvent model and the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PB equation), thereby modulating the potential difference between the solid and liquid. These simulations are often referred to as grand-canonical or fixed-potential DFT calculations. To apply this additional degree of freedom, Legendre transforms are employed in the calculation of free energy, establishing the relationship between the grand potential and the free energy. Other key physical properties, such as atomic forces, vibrational frequencies, and Stark tuning rates, can be derived based on this relationship rather than directly using Legendre transforms. This paper begins by discussing the numerical methodologies for the continuum model of electrolyte double layers and grand-potential algorithms. We then show that atomic forces under grand-canonical ensemble match the Hellmann-Feynman forces observed in canonical ensemble, as previously established. However, vibrational frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit distinct behaviors between these conditions. Through finite displacement methods, we confirm that vibrational frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit differences between grand-canonical and canonical ensembles.</description>

      <title>5- and 6-membered rings: A natural orbital functional study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Global Natural Orbital Functional (GNOF) provides a straightforward approach to capture most electron correlation effects without needing perturbative corrections or limited active spaces selection. In this work, we evaluate both the original GNOF and its modified variant GNOFm on a set of twelve 5- and 6-membered molecular rings, systems characterized primarily by dynamic correlation. This reference set is vital as it comprises essential substructures of more complex molecules. We report complete-basis-set limit correlation energies for GNOF, GNOFm, and the benchmark CCSD(T) method. Across the Dunning basis sets, both functionals deliver a balanced and accurate description of the molecular set, with GNOFm showing small but systematic improvements while preserving the overall robustness of the original formulation. These results confirm the reliability of the GNOF family and its ability to capture dynamic correlation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient aware derivative Gaussian Process. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We demonstrate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a grignard rearrangement, and a bicyclobutadiene rearrangement.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of committor for ion dissociation and interpretable analysis of solvent effects using atom-centered symmetry functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The association and dissociation of ion pairs in water are fundamental to physical chemistry, yet their reaction coordinates are complex, involving not only interionic distance but also solvent-mediated hydration structures. These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water.</description>

      <title>PASPT2: a size-extensive and size-consistent partial-active-space multi-state multi-reference second-order perturbation theory for strongly correlated electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A partial-active-space (PAS) multi-state (MS) multi-reference second-order perturbation theory (MRPT2) for the electronic structure of strongly correlated systems of electrons, dubbed PASPT2, is formulated by linearizing the intermediate normalization-based general-model-space state-universal coupled-cluster theory with singles and doubles [IN-GMS-SU-CCSD; J. Chem. Phys. 119, 5320 (2003)]. At variance with the existence of disconnected terms in the IN-GMS-SU-CCSD amplitude equations, the disconnected terms in the PASPT2 amplitude equations can be avoided completely by choosing a special reference-specific zeroth-order Hamiltonian. The corresponding effective/intermediate Hamiltonian can also be made connected and closed, so as to render the energies obtained by diagonalization fully connected. As such, PASPT2 is strictly size-extensive, in sharp contrast with the parent IN-GMS-SU-CCSD. It is also size-consistent when the PAS of a supermolecule is chosen to be the direct product of those of the physically separated, non-interacting fragments. Prototypical systems are taken as showcases to reveal the efficacy of PASPT2.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band method with Hessian Eigenmode Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states is central to an understanding of reaction kinetics. Double-endpoint methods where both initial and final states are specified, such as the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB), identify the minimum energy path between the two and thereby the saddle point on the energy surface that is relevant for the given transition, thus providing an estimate of the transition state within harmonic transition state theory. Such calculations can, however, incur high computational costs and may suffer stagnation on exceptionally flat or rough energy surfaces. Conversely, methods that only require specification of an initial set of atomic coordinates, such as the minimum mode following (MMF) method, offer efficiency but can converge on saddle points that are not relevant for the transition of interest. Here, we present an adaptive hybrid algorithm that switches between the CI-NEB and the MMF method so as to get faster convergence to the relevant saddle point. The method is benchmarked for the Baker-Chan (BC) saddle point test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential as well as 59 transitions of a heptamer island on Pt(111) from the OptBench set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance shows a median reduction of energy and force calculations by 46% [95% CrI: -55%, -37%] relative to CI-NEB for the BC set, while a 28% reduction is found for the transitions of the heptamer island. Calculations of the BC set where a simple switch from the CI-NEB to the MMF method is made when the magnitude of the atomic forces drops below 0.5 eV/AA requires 30% more force calculations than the OCI-NEB algorithm. These results show that an adaptive hybrid method mixing CI-NEB and MMF can be a highly efficient tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery of atomic rearrangements.</description>

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</description>

Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>
