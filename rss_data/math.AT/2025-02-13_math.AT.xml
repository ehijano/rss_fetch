      <title>Expected Complexity of Barcode Computation via Matrix Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic complexity of computing persistent homology of a randomly generated filtration. We prove upper bounds for the average fill-in (number of non-zero entries) of the boundary matrix on \v{C}ech, Vietoris--Rips and Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi filtrations after matrix reduction, which in turn provide bounds on the expected complexity of the barcode computation. Our method is based on previous results on the expected Betti numbers of the corresponding complexes, which we link to the fill-in of the boundary matrix. Our fill-in bounds for \v{C}ech and Vietoris--Rips complexes are asymptotically tight up to a logarithmic factor. In particular, both our fill-in and computation bounds are better than the worst-case estimates. We also provide an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi filtration realising the worst-case fill-in and computation.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff vs Gromov-Hausdorff distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16648v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed Riemannian manifold and let $X\subseteq M$. If the sample $X$ is sufficiently dense relative to the curvature of $M$, then the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between $X$ and $M$ is bounded from below by half their Hausdorff distance, namely $d_{GH}(X,M) \ge \frac{1}{2} d_H(X,M)$. The constant $\frac{1}{2}$ can be improved depending on the dimension and curvature of the manifold $M$, and obtains the optimal value $1$ in the case of the unit circle, meaning that if $X\subseteq S^1$ satisfies $d_{GH}(X,S^1)&lt;\tfrac{\pi}{6}$, then $d_{GH}(X,S^1)=d_H(X,S^1)$. We also provide versions lower bounding the Gromov-Hausdorff distance $d_{GH}(X,Y)$ between two subsets $X,Y\subseteq M$. Our proofs convert discontinuous functions between metric spaces into simplicial maps between \v{C}ech or Vietoris-Rips complexes. We then produce topological obstructions to the existence of certain maps using the nerve lemma and the fundamental class of the manifold, thus lower bounding the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>Topological Blindspots: Understanding and Extending Topological Deep Learning Through the Lens of Expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological deep learning (TDL) is a rapidly growing field that seeks to leverage topological structure in data and facilitate learning from data supported on topological objects, ranging from molecules to 3D shapes. Most TDL architectures can be unified under the framework of higher-order message-passing (HOMP), which generalizes graph message-passing to higher-order domains. In the first part of the paper, we explore HOMP's expressive power from a topological perspective, demonstrating the framework's inability to capture fundamental topological and metric invariants such as diameter, orientability, planarity, and homology. In addition, we demonstrate HOMP's limitations in fully leveraging lifting and pooling methods on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the expressivity of TDL from a \emph{topological} perspective. In the second part of the paper, we develop two new classes of architectures -- multi-cellular networks (MCN) and scalable MCN (SMCN) -- which draw inspiration from expressive GNNs. MCN can reach full expressivity, but scaling it to large data objects can be computationally expansive. Designed as a more scalable alternative, SMCN still mitigates many of HOMP's expressivity limitations. Finally, we create new benchmarks for evaluating models based on their ability to learn topological properties of complexes. We then evaluate SMCN on these benchmarks and on real-world graph datasets, demonstrating improvements over both HOMP baselines and expressive graph methods, highlighting the value of expressively leveraging topological information. Code and data are available at https://github.com/yoavgelberg/SMCN.</description>
