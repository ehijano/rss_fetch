      <title>The $\kappa$-generalised Distribution for Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical evidence shows stock returns are often heavy-tailed rather than normally distributed. The $\kappa$-generalised distribution, originated in the context of statistical physics by Kaniadakis, is characterised by the $\kappa$-exponential function that is asymptotically exponential for small values and asymptotically power law for large values. This proves to be a useful property and makes it a good candidate distribution for many types of quantities. In this paper we focus on fitting historic daily stock returns for the FTSE 100 and the top 100 Nasdaq stocks. Using a Monte-Carlo goodness of fit test there is evidence that the $\kappa$-generalised distribution is a good fit for a significant proportion of the 200 stock returns analysed.</description>

      <title>Time Instability of the Fama-French Multifactor Models: An International Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the time-varying structure of Fama and French's (1993; 2015) multi-factor models using Fama and MacBeth's (1973) two-step estimation based on the rolling window method. In particular, we employ the generalized GRS statistics proposed by Kamstra and Shi (2024) to examine whether the validity of the risk factors (or factor redundancy) in the FF3 and FF5 models remains stable over time, and investigate whether the manner of portfolio sorting affects the time stability of the validity of the risk factors. In addition, we examine whether the similar results are obtained even when we use different datasets by country and region. First, we find that the effectiveness of factors in the FF3 and FF5 models is not stable over time in all countries. Second, the effectiveness of factors is also affected by the manner of portfolio sorting. Third, the validity of the FF3, FF5, and their nested models do not remain stable over time except for Japan. This suggests that the efficient market hypothesis is supported in the Japanese stock market. Finally, the factor redundancy varies over time and is affected by the manner of portfolio sorting mainly in the U.S. and Europe.</description>
