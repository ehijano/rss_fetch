      <title>Combinatorics of factorization systems on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the combinatorial study of factorization systems on finite lattices, paying special attention to the role that reflective and coreflective factorization systems play in partitioning the poset of factorization systems on a fixed lattice. We ultimately uncover an intricate web of relations with such diverse combinatorial structures as submonoids, monads, Moore systems, transfer systems (from stable equivariant homotopy theory), and poly-Bernoulli numbers.</description>

      <title>When do graph covers preserve the clique dynamics of infinite graphs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate for which classes of (potentially infinite) graphs the clique dynamics is cover stable, i. e., when clique convergence/divergence is preserved under triangular covering maps. We first present an instructive counterexample: a clique convergent graph which covers a clique divergent graph and which is covered by a clique divergent graph. Based on this we then focus on local conditions (i. e., conditions on the neighbourhoods of vertices) and show that the following are sufficient to imply cover stability: local girth $\geq 7$ and local minimum degree $\geq 2$; being locally cyclic and of minimum degree $\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of mapping spaces by inverse limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the results of reconstruction of compact metric spaces by inverse limits, we show that if $(X, d), (Y, d)$ are compact metric spaces, then the mapping space $Y^X$ is homotopy equivalent to the inverse limit of an inverse system of finite $T_0$-spaces which depends only on the finite open covers of $X$ and $Y$. Applying our tools, we obtain that if $H$ is an isotopy of a compact metric space $(X, d)$, then $H_1H^{-1}_0$ can be approximated in terms of moves of a finite $T_0$-space.</description>

      <title>Spectral condition for $k$-factor-criticality in $t$-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22951v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is called $k$-factor-critical if $G-S$ has a perfect matching for every $S\subseteq G$ with $|S|=k$. A connected graph $G$ is called $t$-connected if it has more than $t$ vertices and remains connected whenever fewer than $t$ vertices are removed. We give a condition on the number of edges and a condition on the spectral radius for $k$-factor-criticality in $t$-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Colouring normal quadrangulations of projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Youngs proved that every non-bipartite quadrangulation of the projective plane $\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^2$ is 4-chromatic. Kaiser and Stehl\'{\i}k [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 113 (2015), 1-17] generalised the notion of a quadrangulation to higher dimensions and extended Youngs' theorem by proving that every non-bipartite quadrangulation of the $d$-dimensional projective space $\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^d$ with $d \geq 2$ has chromatic number at least $d+2$. On the other hand, Hachimori et al. [European. J. Combin. 125 (2025), 104089] defined another kind of high-dimensional quadrangulation, called a normal quadrangulation. They proved that if a non-bipartite normal quadrangulation $G$ of $\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^d$ with any $d \geq 2$ satisfies a certain geometric condition, then $G$ is $4$-chromatic, and asked whether the geometric condition can be removed from the result. In this paper, we give a negative solution to their problem for the case $d=3$, proving that there exist 3-dimensional normal quadrangulations of $\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^3$ whose chromatic number is arbitrarily large. Moreover, we prove that no normal quadrangulation of $\mathbb{R}\mathrm{P}^d$ with any $d \geq 2$ has chromatic number $3$.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation for number of edges in random intersection graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random intersection graph model $\mathcal G(n,m,p)$ is considered. Due to substantial edge dependencies, studying even fundamental statistics such as the subgraph count is significantly more challenging than in the classical binomial model $\mathcal G(n,p)$. First, we establish normal approximation bound in both the Wasserstein and the Kolmogorov distances for a class of local statistics on $\mathcal G(n,m,p)$. Next, we apply these results to derive such bounds for the standardised number of edges, and determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for its asymptotic normality. We develop a new method that provides a combinatorial interpretation and facilitates the estimation of analytical expressions related to general distance bounds. In particular, this allows us to control the behaviour of central moments of subgraph existence indicators. The presented method can also be extended to count copies of subgraphs larger than a single edge.</description>

      <title>Permutohedron's volume via Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent project, Castillo, Libedinsky, Plaza, and the author established a deep connection between the size of lower Bruhat intervals in affine Weyl groups and the volume of the permutohedron, showing that the former can be expressed as a linear combination of the latter. In this paper, we provide a formula for the volume of this polytope in terms of Dyck paths. Thus, we present a shorter, alternative, and enlightening proof of a previous formula given by Postnikov.</description>

      <title>Hall's marriage theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1935, Philip Hall published what is often referred to as ``Hall's marriage theorem'' in a short paper (P.~Hall, On Representatives of Subsets, \textit{J. Lond. Math. Soc.} (1) \textbf{10} (1935), no.1, 26--30.) This paper has been very influential. I state the theorem and outline Hall's proof, together with some equivalent (or stronger) earlier results, and proceed to discuss some the many directions in combinatorics and beyond which this theorem has influenced.</description>

      <title>A local limit theorem for the edge counts of random induced subgraphs of a random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a `dense' Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph model $G=G_{n,M}$ with $n$ vertices and $M$ edges, where we assume the edge density $M/\binom{n}{2}$ is bounded away from 0 and 1. Fix $k=k(n)$ with $k/n$ bounded away from 0 and~1, and let $S$ be a random subset of size $k$ of the vertices of $G$. We show that with probability $1-\exp(-n^{\Omega(1)})$, $G$ satisfies both a central limit theorem and a local limit theorem for the empirical distribution of the edge count $e(G[S])$ of the subgraph of $G$ induced by $S$, where the distribution is over uniform random choices of the $k$-set $S$.</description>

      <title>A Resolution of the McCarty Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The McCarty Conjecture states that any McCarty Matrix (an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ with positive integer entries and each of the $2n$ row and column sums equal to $n$), can be additively decomposed into two other matrices, $B$ and $C$, such that $B$ has row and column sumsets both equal to $\{1, 2,... n\}$, and $C$ has row and column sumsets both equal to $\{0, 1,... n-1\}$. The problem can also be formulated in terms of bipartite graphs. In this paper we use probabilistic methods to resolve this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Two-block paths in oriented graphs of large semidegree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of oriented paths with two blocks in oriented graphs under semidegree conditions. A block of an oriented path is a maximal directed subpath. Given positive integers $k$ and $\ell$ with $k/2\le \ell &lt; k$, we establish a semidegree function that guarantees the containment of every oriented path with two blocks of sizes $\ell$ and $k-\ell$. As a corollary, we show that every oriented graph with all in- and out-degrees at least $3k/4$ contains every two-block path with $k$ arcs. Our results extend previous work on Stein's conjecture and related problems concerning oriented paths.</description>

      <title>A convergence technique for the game i-Mark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of i-Mark is an impartial combinatorial game introduced by Sopena (2016). The game is parametrized by two sets of positive integers $S$, $D$, where $\min D\ge 2$. From position $n\ge 0$ one can move to any position $n-s$, $s\in S$, as long as $n-s\ge 0$, as well as to any position $n/d$, $d\in D$, as long as $n&gt;0$ and $d$ divides $n$. The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the last player to move is the winner. Sopena, and subsequently Friman and Nivasch (2021), characterized the Sprague-Grundy sequences of many cases of i-Mark$(S,D)$ with $|D|=1$. Friman and Nivasch also obtained some partial results for the case i-Mark$(\{1\},\{2,3\})$.
  In this paper we present a convergence technique that gives polynomial-time algorithms for the Sprague-Grundy sequence of many instances of i-Mark with $|D|&gt;1$. In particular, we prove our technique works for all games i-Mark$(\{1\},\{d_1,d_2\})$.
  Keywords: Combinatorial game, impartial game, Sprague-Grundy function, convergence, dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Steiner triple systems with high discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of discrepancy questions for combinatorial designs. Specifically, we show that, for every fixed $r\ge 3$ and $n\equiv 1,3 \pmod{6}$, any $r$-colouring of the triples on $[n]$ admits a Steiner triple system of order $n$ with discrepancy $\Omega(n^2)$. This is not true for $r=2$, but we are able to asymptotically characterise all $2$-colourings which do not contain a Steiner triple system with high discrepancy. The key step in our proofs is a characterization of 3-uniform hypergraphs avoiding a certain natural type of induced subgraphs, contributing to the structural theory of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for the variation of toughness under the distance spectral in graphs involving minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of graph toughness was first introduced in 1973. In 1995, scholars first explored the lower bound of the toughness of connected d-regular graphs with respect to d and the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The concept of the variation of toughness was first introduced in 1988. The variation of toughness is defined as tau(G) = min{|S|/(c(G-S)-1)}. In 2025, Chen, Fan, and Lin provided sufficient conditions for a graph to be t-tough in terms of the minimum degree and the distance spectral radius. Inspired by this, we propose a sufficient condition for a graph to be tau-tough in terms of minimum degree and distance spectral radius, and provide the corresponding proof, where |S| and c(G-S)-1 are mutually divisible.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P(k,n)$ be the set of products of $k$ factors from the set $\{1,\ldots , n\}.$ In 1955, Erd\H{o}s posed the problem of determining the order of magnitude of $|P (2, n)|$ and proved that $|P (2, n)| = o(n^2 )$ for $n \to\infty$. In 2015, Darda and Hujdurovi\'c asked whether, for each fixed $n$, $|P (k, n)|$ is a polynomial in $k$ of degree $\pi(n)$ - the number of primes not larger than $n$. Recently, Granville, Smith and Walker published an effective version of Khovanskii's Theorem. We apply this new result to show, that for each integer $n$, there is a polynomial $q_n$ of degree $\pi(n)$ such that $|P (k, n)|=q_n(k)$ for each $k\geq n^2\cdot\left(\prod_{m=1}^{\pi(n)} \log_{p_m}(n)\right)-n+1.$ Moreover, we give an upper estimate of the leading coefficient of $q_n$.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs of arbitrary uniformity with vanishing codegree Tur\'an density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The codegree Tur\'an density $\pi_{\text{co}}(F)$ of a $k$-uniform hypergraph (or $k$-graph) $F$ is the infimum over all $d$ such that a copy of $F$ is contained in any sufficiently large $n$-vertex $k$-graph $G$ with the property that any $(k-1)$-subset of $V(G)$ is contained in at least $dn$ edges. The problem of determining $\pi_{\text{co}}(F)$ for a $k$-graph $F$ is in general very difficult when $k \geq 3$, and there were previously very few nontrivial examples of $k$-graphs $F$ for which $\pi_{\text{co}}(F)$ was known when $k \geq 4$.
  In this paper, we prove that $C_\ell^{(k)-}$, the $k$-uniform tight cycle of length $\ell$ minus an edge, has vanishing codegree Tur\'an density if and only if $\ell \equiv 0, \pm 1 \pmod{k}$ when $\ell \geq k + 2$. This generalises a result of Piga, Sales and Sch\"ulke, who proved that $\pi_\text{co}(C_\ell^{(3)-}) = 0$ when $\ell \geq 5$. The method used to prove that $\pi_\text{co}(C_\ell^{(k)-}) = 0$ when $\ell \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{k}$ and $\ell \geq 2k - 1$ in fact gives a rather larger class of $k$-graphs with vanishing codegree Tur\'an density. We also answer a question of Piga and Sch\"ulke by proving that another family of $k$-graphs, studied by them, has vanishing codegree Tur\'an density.</description>

Abstract: By using level one polynomial representations of affine Hecke algebras of type $A$, we obtain a $(q,t)$-analogue of the chromatic symmetric functions of unit interval graphs which generalizes Syu Kato's formula for the chromatic symmetric functions of unit interval graphs. We show that at $q=1$, the $(q,t)$-chromatic symmetric functions essentially reduce to the chromatic quasisymmetric functions defined by Shareshian-Wachs, which in particular gives an algebraic proof of Kato's formula. We also give an explicit formula of the $(q,t)$-chromatic symmetric functions at $q=\infty$, which leads to a probability theoretic interpretation of $e$-expansion coefficients of chromatic quasisymmetric functions used in our proof of the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture.
  Moreover, we observe that the $(q,t)$-chromatic symmetric functions are multiplicative with respect to certain deformed multiplication on the ring of symmetric functions. We give a simple description of such multiplication in terms of the affine Hecke algebras of type $A$. We also obtain a recipe to produce $(q,t)$-chromatic symmetric functions from chromatic quasisymmetric functions, which actually makes sense for any oriented graphs.</description>

      <title>The spanning tree spectrum: improved bounds and simple proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of spanning trees of a graph $G$, denoted $\tau(G)$, is a well studied graph parameter with numerous connections to other areas of mathematics. In a recent remarkable paper, answering a question of Sedl\'a\v{c}ek from 1969, Chan, Kontorovich and Pak showed that $\tau(G)$ takes at least $1.1103^n$ different values across simple (and planar) $n$-vertex graphs $G$, for large enough $n$. We give a very short, purely combinatorial proof that at least $1.49^n$ values are attained. We also prove that exponential growth can be achieved with regular graphs, determining the growth rate in another problem first raised by Sedl\'a\v{c}ek in the late 1960's. We further show that the following modular dual version of the result holds. For any integer $N$ and any $u &lt; N$ there exists a planar graph on $O(\log N)$ vertices whose number of spanning trees is $u$ modulo $N$.</description>

      <title>The Stamp Folding Problem From a Mountain-Valley Perspective: Enumerations and Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strip of square stamps can be folded in many ways such that all of the stamps are stacked in a single pile in the folded state. The stamp folding problem asks for the number of such foldings and has previously been studied extensively. We consider this problem with the additional restriction of fixing the mountain-valley assignment of each crease in the stamp pattern. We provide a closed form for counting the number of legal foldings on specific patterns of mountain-valley assignments, including a surprising appearance of the Catalan numbers. We construct upper and lower bounds for the number of ways to fold a given mountain-valley assignment on the strip of stamps. Lastly, we provide experimental evidence towards more general results.</description>

      <title>Herscovici Conjecture on Pebbling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a configuration of pebbles on the vertices of a connected graph. A pebbling move is to remove two pebbles from a vertex and to place one pebble at the neighbouring vertex of the vertex from which the pebbles are removed.
  For a positive integer $t$, with every configuration of $\pi_t(G)$(least positive integer) pebbles, if we can transfer $t$ pebbles to any target through a number of pebbling moves then $\pi_t(G)$ is called the $t$-pebbling number of $G$.
  We discuss the computation of the $t$-pebbling number, the $2t-$ pebbling property and Herscovici conjecture considering total graphs.
  \bigskip \noindent Keywords: pebbling moves, $t$- pebbling number, $2t$-pebbling property, Herscovici conjecture, total graphs.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformed rationals and irrationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of $q$-deformation, or ``$q$-analogue'' arises in many areas of mathematics. In algebra and representation theory, it is the origin of quantum groups; $q$-deformations are important for knot invariants, combinatorial enumeration, discrete geometry, analysis, and many other parts of mathematics. In mathematical physics, $q$-deformations are often understood as ``quantizations''.
  The recently introduced notion of a $q$-deformed real number is based on the geometric idea of invariance by a modular group action. The goal of this lecture is to explain what is a $q$-rational and a $q$-irrational, demonstrate beautiful properties of these objects, and describe their relations to many different areas. We also tried to describe some applications of $q$-numbers.</description>

      <title>Odd Cuts in Bipartite Grafts II: Structure and Universality of Decapital Distance Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of papers characterizing the maximum packing of \( T \)-cuts in bipartite grafts, following the first paper (N.~Kita, ``Tight cuts in bipartite grafts~I: Capital distance components,'' {arXiv:2202.00192v2}, 2022). Given a graft $(G, T)$, a minimum join $F$, and a specified vertex $r$ called the root, the distance components of $(G, T)$ are defined as subgraphs of $G$ determined by the distances induced by $F$. A distance component is called {\em capital} if it contains the root; otherwise, it is called {\em decapital}. In our first paper, we investigated the canonical structure of capital distance components in bipartite grafts, which can be described using the graft analogue of the Kotzig--Lov\'asz decomposition. In this paper, we provide the counterpart structure for the decapital distance components. We also establish a necessary and sufficient condition for two vertices $r$ and $r'$ under which a decapital distance component with respect to root $r$ is also a decapital distance component with respect to root $r'$. As a consequence, we obtain that the total number of decapital distance components in a bipartite graft, taken over all choices of root, is equal to twice the number of edges in a minimum join of the graft.</description>

      <title>Directed treewidth is closed under taking butterfly minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Butterfly minors are a generalisation of the minor containment relation for undirected graphs to directed graphs. Many results in directed structural graph theory use this notion as a central tool next to directed treewidth, a generalisation of the width measure treewidth to directed graphs. Adler [JCTB'07] showed that the directed treewidth is not closed under taking butterfly minors. Over the years, many alternative definitions for directed treewidth appeared throughout the literature, equivalent to the original definition up to small functions. In this paper, we consider the major ones and show that not all of them share the problem identified by Adler.</description>

      <title>On a question about real rooted polynomials and f-polynomials of simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a polynomial $f(t) = 1+f_0t+\cdots +f_{d-1}t^d$ with positive integer coefficients Bell and Skandera ask if real rootedness of f(t) implies that there is a simplicial complex with f-vector $(1,f_0 \ldots,f_{d-1})$. In this paper we discover properties implied by the real rootedness of f(t) in terms of the binomial representation $f_i = \binom{x_{i+1}}{i+1}, i \geq 0$. We use these to provide a sufficient criterion for a positive answer to the question by Bell and Skandera. We also describe two further approaches to the conjecture and use one to verify that some well studied real rooted classical polynomials are f-polynomials. Finally, we provide a series of results showing that the set of f-vectors of simplicial complexes is closed under constructions also preserving real rootedness of their generating polynomials.</description>

      <title>Double-jump phase transition for the reverse Littlewood--Offord problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s conjectured in 1945 that for any unit vectors $v_1, \dotsc, v_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and signs $\varepsilon_1, \dotsc, \varepsilon_n$ taken independently and uniformly in $\{-1,1\}$, the random Rademacher sum $\sigma = \varepsilon_1 v_1 + \dotsb + \varepsilon_n v_n$ satisfies $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq 1$ with probability $\Omega(1/n)$. While this conjecture is false for even $n$, Beck has proved that $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq \sqrt{2}$ always holds with probability $\Omega(1/n)$. Recently, He, Ju\v{s}kevi\v{c}ius, Narayanan, and Spiro conjectured that the Erd\H{o}s' conjecture holds when $n$ is odd. We disprove this conjecture by exhibiting vectors $v_1, \dotsc, v_n$ for which $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq 1$ occurs with probability $O(1/n^{3/2})$. On the other hand, an approximated version of their conjecture holds: we show that we always have $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq 1 + \delta$ with probability $\Omega_\delta(1/n)$, for all $\delta &gt; 0$. This shows that when $n$ is odd, the minimum probability that $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq r$ exhibits a double-jump phase transition at $r = 1$, as we can also show that $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq 1$ occurs with probability at least $\Omega((1/2+\mu)^n)$ for some $\mu &gt; 0$. Additionally, and using a different construction, we give a negative answer to a question of Beck and two other questions of He, Ju\v{s}kevi\v{c}ius, Narayanan, and Spiro, concerning the optimal constructions minimising the probability that $\|\sigma\|_2 \leq \sqrt{2}$. We also make some progress on the higher dimensional versions of these questions.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of positional social choice correspondences under incomplete information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the manipulability of social choice correspondences in situations where individuals have incomplete information about others' preferences. We propose a general concept of manipulability that depends on the extension rule used to derive preferences over sets of alternatives from preferences over alternatives, as well as on individuals' level of information. We then focus on the manipulability of social choice correspondences when the Kelly extension rule is used, and individuals are assumed to have the capability to anticipate the outcome of the collective decision. Under these assumptions, we introduce some monotonicity properties of social choice correspondences whose combined satisfaction is sufficient for manipulability, prove a result of manipulability for unanimous positional social choice correspondences, and present a detailed analysis of the manipulability properties for the Borda, the Plurality and the Negative Plurality social choice correspondences.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of Quantum CSP Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any perfect quantum strategy for the two-prover game encoding a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be simulated via a perfect classical strategy with an extra classical communication channel, whose size depends only on $(i)$ the size of the shared quantum system used in the quantum strategy, and $(ii)$ structural parameters of the CSP template. The result is obtained via a combinatorial characterisation of perfect classical strategies with extra communication channels and a geometric rounding procedure for the projection-valued measurements involved in quantum strategies. A key intermediate step of our proof is to establish that the gap between the classical chromatic number of graphs and its quantum variant is bounded when the quantum strategy involves shared quantum information of bounded size.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum Chromatic Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest known gap between quantum and classical chromatic number of graphs, obtained via quantum protocols for colouring Hadamard graphs based on the Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Fourier transform, is exponential. We put forth a quantum pseudo-telepathy version of Khot's $d$-to-$1$ Games Conjecture and prove that, conditional to its validity, the gap is unbounded: There exist graphs whose quantum chromatic number is $3$ and whose classical chromatic number is arbitrarily large. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a certain form of pseudo-telepathic XOR games would imply the conjecture and, thus, the unboundedness of the quantum chromatic gap. As two technical steps of our proof that might be of independent interest, we establish a quantum adjunction theorem for Pultr functors between categories of relational structures, and we prove that the Dinur--Khot--Kindler--Minzer--Safra reduction, recently used for proving the $2$-to-$2$ Games Theorem, is quantum complete.</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups of moduli spaces of real weighted stable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ordinary and $S_n$-equivariant fundamental groups of the moduli space $\overline{M_{0,n+1}}(\mathbb{R})$ of real $(n+1)$-marked stable curves of genus $0$ are known as \emph{cactus groups} $J_n$ and have applications both in geometry and the representation theory of Lie algebras. In this paper, we compute the ordinary and $S_n$-equivariant fundamental groups of the Hassett space of weighted real stable curves $\overline{M_{0,\mathcal{A}}}(\mathbb{R})$ with $S_n$-symmetric weight vector $\mathcal{A} = (1/a, \ldots, 1/a, 1)$, which we call \emph{weighted cactus groups} $J_n^a$. We show that $J_n^a$ is obtained from the usual cactus presentation by introducing braid relations, which successively simplify the group from $J_n$ to $S_n \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ as $a$ increases. Our proof is by decomposing $\overline{M_{0,\mathcal{A}}}(\mathbb{R})$ as a polytopal complex, generalizing a similar known decomposition for $\overline{M_{0,n+1}}(\mathbb{R})$. In the unweighted case, these cells are known to be cubes and are `dual' to the usual decomposition into associahedra (by the combinatorial type of the stable curve). For $\overline{M_{0,\mathcal{A}}}(\mathbb{R})$, our decomposition instead consists of products of permutahedra. The cells of the decomposition are indexed by weighted stable trees, but `dually' to the usual indexing.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic subset selection of multivariate Markov chains via submodular optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimally projecting the transition matrix of a finite ergodic multivariate Markov chain onto a lower-dimensional state space. Specifically, we seek to construct a projected Markov chain that optimizes various information-theoretic criteria under cardinality constraints. These criteria include entropy rate, information-theoretic distance to factorizability, independence, and stationarity. We formulate these tasks as best subset selection problems over multivariate Markov chains and leverage the submodular (or supermodular) structure of the objective functions to develop efficient greedy-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees. We extend our analysis to $k$-submodular settings and introduce a generalized version of the distorted greedy algorithm, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we illustrate the theory and algorithms through extensive numerical experiments with publicly available code on multivariate Markov chains associated with the Bernoulli-Laplace and Curie-Weiss model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The edge group of a simplicial complex is a well-known, combinatorial version of the fundamental group. It is a group associated to a simplicial complex that consists of equivalence classes of edge loops and that is isomorphic to the ordinary (topological) fundamental group of the spatial realization. We define a counterpart to the edge group that likewise gives a combinatorial version of the second (higher) homotopy group. Working entirely combinatorially, we show our group is an abelian group and also respects products. We show that our combinatorially defined group is isomorphic to the ordinary (topological) second homotopy group of the spatial realization.</description>

      <title>Minimal solutions of tropical linear differential systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study minimal (with respect to inclusion) solutions of systems of tropical linear differential equations. We describe the set of all minimal solutions for a single equation. It is shown that any tropical linear differential equation in a single unknown has either a solution or a solution at infinity. For a generic system of $n$ tropical linear differential equations in $n$ unknowns, upper and lower bounds on the number of minimal solutions are established. The upper bound involves inversions of a family of permutations which generalize inversions of a single permutation. For $n=1, 2$, we show that the bounds are sharp.</description>

      <title>On Cameron's Greedy Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A base for a permutation group $G$ acting on a set $\Omega$ is a subset $\mathcal{B}$ of $\Omega$ whose pointwise stabiliser $G_{(\mathcal{B})}$ is trivial. There is a natural greedy algorithm for constructing a base of relatively small size. We write $\mathcal{G}(G)$ the maximum size of a base it produces, and $b(G)$ for the size of the smallest base for $G$. In 1999, Peter Cameron conjectured that there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that every finite primitive group $G$ satisfies $\mathcal{G}(G)\leq cb(G)$. We show that if $G$ is $\mathrm{S}_n$ or $\mathrm{A}_n$ acting primitively then either Cameron's Greedy Conjecture holds for $G$, or $G$ falls into one class of possible exceptions.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a certain restricted partition function of Lin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $b(n)$ be the number of three-colored partitions $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ of $n$ such that $\pi_1$ has distinct odd parts and $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ have parts only divisible by $4$. Utilizing modular forms, Lin obtained the generating functions for $b(3n+1)$ and $b(3n+2)$, which yields the congruence $b(3n+2)\equiv 0\pmod{3}$. In this work, we give elementary proofs of these generating functions by employing $q$-series manipulations and dissection formulas. We also establish an infinite family of internal congruences modulo $3$ satisfied by $b(n)$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Diamond-Saturated Families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01118v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given fixed poset $\mathcal P$ we say that a family of subsets of $[n]$ is $\mathcal P$-saturated if it does not contain an induced copy of $\mathcal P$, but whenever we add to it a new set, an induced copy of $\mathcal P$ is formed. The size of the smallest such family is denoted by $\text{sat}^*(n, \mathcal P)$. For the diamond poset $\mathcal D_2$ (the two-dimensional Boolean lattice), Martin, Smith and Walker proved that $\sqrt n\leq\text{sat}^*(n, \mathcal D_2)\leq n+1$. In this paper we prove that $\text{sat}^*(n, \mathcal D_2)\geq (4-o(1))\sqrt n$. We also explore the properties that a diamond-saturated family of size $c\sqrt n$, for a constant $c$, would have to have.</description>

      <title>A hypergraph Heilmann--Lieb theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Heilmann--Lieb theorem is a fundamental theorem in algebraic combinatorics which provides a characterization of the distribution of the zeros of matching polynomials of graphs. In this paper, we establish a hypergraph Heilmann--Lieb theorem as follows. Let $\h$ be a connected $k$-graph with maximum degree ${\Delta}\geq 2$ and let $\mu(\h, x)$ be its matching polynomial. We show that the zeros (with multiplicities) of $\mu(\h, x)$ are invariant under a rotation of an angle $2\pi/{\ell}$ in the complex plane for some positive integer $\ell$ and $k$ is the maximum integer with this property. We further prove that the maximum modulus $\lambda(\h)$ of all the zeros of $\mu(\h, x)$ is a simple root of $\mu(\h, x)$ and satisfies $$\Delta^{\frac{1}{ k}} \leq \lambda(\h)&lt; \frac{k}{k-1}\big((k-1)(\Delta-1)\big)^{\frac{1}{ k}}.$$ To achieve these, we prove that $\mu(\h, x)$ divides the matching polynomial of the $k$-walk-tree of $\h$, which generalizes a classical result due to Godsil from graphs to hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>On Proper Colorings of Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the infinite version of the $k$-switch problem of Greenwell and Lov\'asz.
  Given infinite cardinals ${\kappa}$ and ${\lambda}$, for functions $x,y\in {}^{\lambda}\kappa $ we say that they are totally different if $x(i)\ne y(i)$ for each $i\in {\lambda}$. A function $F:{}^{\lambda}\kappa \longrightarrow {\kappa} $ is a proper coloring if $F(x)\ne F(y)$ whenever $x$ and $y$ are totally different elements of ${}^\lambda{\kappa} $.
  We say that $F$ is weakly uniform iff there are pairwise totally different functions $\{r_{\alpha}:{\alpha}&lt;{\kappa}\}\subset {}^{\lambda}{\kappa}$ such that $F(r_{\alpha})={\alpha}$;
  $F$ is tight if there is no proper coloring $G:{}^{\lambda}\kappa \longrightarrow {\kappa}$ such that there is exactly one $x\in {}^{\lambda}{\kappa}$ with $G(x)\ne F(x)$.
  We show that given a proper coloring $F:{}^{\lambda}{\kappa}\to {\kappa}$, the following statements are equivalent $F$ is weakly uniform, there is a ${\kappa} ^{+}$-complete ultrafilter $\mathscr{U}$ on ${\lambda}$ and there is a permutation ${\pi}\in Symm({\kappa})$ such that for each $x\in {}^{\lambda}{\kappa}$ we have
  $$F(x)={\pi}({\alpha})\ \Longleftrightarrow \ \{i\in {\lambda}: x(i)={\alpha}\} \in \mathscr{U}.$$
  We also show that there are tight proper colorings which cannot be obtained such a way.</description>

      <title>The structure of Lonely Runner spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01462v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each subtorus $T$ of $(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$, let $D(T)$ denote the (infimal) $L^\infty$-distance from $T$ to the point $(1/2,\ldots, 1/2)$. The $n$-th Lonely Runner spectrum $\mathcal{S}(n)$ is defined to be the set of all values achieved by $D(T)$ as $T$ ranges over the $1$-dimensional subtori of $(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$ that are not contained in the coordinate hyperplanes. The Lonely Runner Conjecture predicts that $\mathcal{S}(n) \subseteq [0,1/2-1/(n+1)]$. Rather than attack this conjecture, we study the structure of the sets $\mathcal{S}(n)$. The main purpose of this note is to show that the set of accumulation points of $\mathcal{S}(n)$ is precisely $\mathcal{S}(n-1)$.</description>

Abstract: Garbe, Hladk\'y, \v{S}ileikis and Skerman [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Stat., 60 (2024), pp. 2878-2922] recently introduced a general class of random graph processes called flip processes and proved that the typical evolution of these discrete-time random graph processes correspond to certain continuous-time deterministic graphon trajectories. We obtain a complete characterization of the equivalence classes of flip process rules with the same graphon trajectories. As an application, we characterize the flip process rules which are unique in their equivalence classes. These include several natural families of rules such as the complementing rules, the component completion rules, the extremist rules, and the clique removal rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a poset $(Q,\le_{Q})$ contains an induced copy of a poset $(P,\le_P)$ if there is an injective function $\phi\colon P\to Q$ such that for every two $X,Y\in P$,\;\;$X\le_P Y$ if and only if $\phi(X)\le_Q \phi(Y)$. We denote the Boolean lattice $(2^{[n]},\subseteq)$ by $Q_n$. Given a fixed $2$-coloring $c$ of a poset $P$, the poset Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal number of this colored poset is the smallest integer $N$ such that every $2$-coloring of the Boolean lattice $Q_N$ contains an induced copy of $P$ colored as in $c$, or a monochromatic induced copy of $Q_n$. We present bounds on the poset Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal number of general colored posets, antichains, chains, and small Boolean lattices. Let the poset Ramsey number $R(Q_n,Q_n)$ be the least $N$ such that every $2$-coloring of $Q_N$ contains a monochromatic induced copy of $Q_n$. As a corollary, we show that $R(Q_n,Q_n)&gt; 2.02n$, improving on the best known lower bound $2n+1$ by Cox and Stolee \cite{CS}.</description>

      <title>Coloring Grids Avoiding Bicolored Paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vertex-coloring problem on graphs avoiding bicolored members of a family of subgraphs has been widely studied. Most well-known examples are star coloring and acyclic coloring of graphs (Gr\"unbaum, 1973) where bicolored copies of $P_4$ and cycles are not allowed, respectively. In this paper, we study a variation of this problem, by considering vertex coloring on grids forbidding bicolored paths. We let $P_k$-chromatic number of a graph be the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertex set properly avoiding a bicolored $P_k.$ We show that in any 3-coloring of the cartesian product of paths, $P_{k-2}\square P_{k-2}$, there is a bicolored $P_k.$ With our result, the problem of finding the $P_k$-chromatic number of product of two paths (2-dimensional grid) is settled for all $k.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frieze patterns have attracted significant attention recently, motivated by their relationship with cluster algebras. A longstanding open problem has been to provide a combinatorial model for frieze patterns over the ring of integers modulo $n$ akin to Conway and Coxeter's celebrated model for positive integer frieze patterns. Here we solve this problem using the Farey complex of the ring of integers modulo $n$; in fact, using more general Farey complexes we provide combinatorial models for frieze patterns over any rings whatsoever.
  Our strategy generalises that of the first author and of Morier-Genoud et al. for integers and that of Felikson et al. for Eisenstein integers. We also generalise results of Singerman and Strudwick on diameters of Farey graphs, we recover a theorem of Morier-Genoud on enumerating friezes over finite fields, and we classify those frieze patterns modulo $n$ that lift to frieze patterns over the integers in terms of the topology of the corresponding Farey complexes.</description>

Abstract: We consider labelings of a finite regular tree by a finite alphabet subject to restrictions specified by a nonnegative transition matrix, propose an algorithm for determining whether the set of possible configurations on the last row of the tree is independent of the symbol at the root, and prove that the algorithm succeeds in a bounded number of steps, provided that the dimension of the tree is greater than or equal to the maximum row sum of the transition matrix. (The question was motivated by calculation of topological pressure on trees and is an extension of the idea of primitivity for nonnegative matrices.)</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal problems on outerplanar and planar graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,F)$ and $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{P}}(n,F)$ be the maximum spectral radius over all $n$-vertex $F$-free outerplanar graphs and planar graphs, respectively. Define $tC_l$ as $t$ vertex-disjoint $l$-cycles, $B_{tl}$ as the graph obtained by sharing a common vertex among $t$ edge-disjoint $l$-cycles %$B_{tl}$ as the graph obtained by connecting all cycles in $tC_l$ at a single vertex, and $(t+1)K_{2}$ as the disjoint union of $t+1$ copies of $K_2$. In the 1990s, Cvetkovi\'c and Rowlinson conjectured $K_1 \vee P_{n-1}$ maximizes spectral radius in outerplanar graphs on $n$ vertices, while Boots and Royle (independently, Cao and Vince) conjectured $K_2 \vee P_{n-2} $ does so in planar graphs. Tait and Tobin [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2017] determined the fundamental structure as the key to confirming these two conjectures for sufficiently large $n.$ Recently, Fang et al. [J. Graph Theory, 2024] characterized the extremal graph with $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{P}}(n,tC_l)$ in planar graphs by using this key. In this paper, we first focus on outerplanar graphs and adopt a similar approach to describe the key structure of the connected extremal graph with $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,F)$, where $F$ is contained in $K_1 \vee P_{n-1}$ but not in $K_{1} \vee ((t-1)K_2\cup(n-2t+1)K_1)$. Based on this structure, we determine $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,B_{tl})$ and $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{OP}}(n,(t+1)K_{2})$ along with their unique extremal graphs for all $t\geq1$, $l\geq3$ and large $n$. Moreover, we further extend the results to planar graphs, characterizing the unique extremal graph with $\emph{spex}_{\mathcal{P}}(n,B_{tl})$ for all $t\geq3$, $l\geq3$ and large $n$.</description>

Abstract: We focus on two specific generalizations of the chromatic symmetric function: one involving universal graphs and the other concerning vertex-weighted graphs. In this paper, we introduce a unified generalization that incorporates both approaches and demonstrate that the resulting new invariants inherit characteristics from each, particularly the properties of complete invariants. Additionally, we construct complete invariants for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and partially ordered sets (posets). As a corollary, these invariants can distinguish hyperplane arrangements that are distinguishable by their intersection posets.</description>

      <title>Weak maps and the Tutte Polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ and $N$ be matroids such that $N$ is the image of $M$ under a rank-preserving weak map. Generalizing results of Lucas, we prove that, for $x$ and $y$ positive, $T(M;x,y)\geq T(N;x,y)$ if and only if $x+y\geq xy$ or $M\cong N$. We give a number of consequences of this result.</description>

Abstract: Scale invariant scattering suggests that all Bernoulli numbers B_{2n} can be naturally partitioned, i.e., written as particular finite sums of same-signed, monotonic, rational numbers. Some properties of these rational numbers are discussed here, especially in the limit of large n.</description>

      <title>Every Graph is Essential to Large Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for every graph $H$, there is a hereditary weakly sparse graph class $\mathcal C_H$ of unbounded treewidth such that the $H$-free (i.e., excluding $H$ as an induced subgraph) graphs of $\mathcal C_H$ have bounded treewidth. This refutes several conjectures and critically thwarts the quest for the unavoidable induced subgraphs in classes of unbounded treewidth, a wished-for counterpart of the Grid Minor theorem. We actually show a stronger result: For every positive integer $t$, there is a hereditary graph class $\mathcal C_t$ of unbounded treewidth such that for any graph $H$ of treewidth at most $t$, the $H$-free graphs of $\mathcal C_t$ have bounded treewidth. Our construction is a variant of so-called layered wheels. We also introduce a framework of abstract layered wheels, based on their most salient properties. In particular, we streamline and extend key lemmas previously shown on individual layered wheels. We believe that this should greatly help develop this topic, which appears to be a very strong yet underexploited source of counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Cyclic subsets in regular Dirac graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1996, in his last paper, Erd\H{o}s asked the following question that he formulated together with Faudree: is there a positive $c$ such that any $(n+1)$-regular graph $G$ on $2n$ vertices contains at least $c 2^{2n}$ distinct vertex-subsets $S$ that are cyclic, meaning that there is a cycle in $G$ using precisely the vertices in $S$. We answer this question in the affirmative in a strong form by proving the following exact result: if $n$ is sufficiently large and $G$ minimises the number of cyclic subsets then $G$ is obtained from the complete bipartite graph $K_{n-1,n+1}$ by adding a $2$-factor (a spanning collection of vertex-disjoint cycles) within the part of size $n+1$. In particular, for $n$ large, this implies that the optimal $c$ in the problem is precisely $1/2$.</description>

Abstract: A word $w_1w_2\cdots w_n$ is said to be up-down if $w_1 &lt; w_2 &gt;w_3 \cdots$. Carlitz and Scoville found the generating function for the number of up-down words over an alphabet of size $k$. Using properties of the Chebyshev polynomials we derive a closed-form formula for these numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wiener index of a vertex coloring of a graph is defined to be the sum of all pairwise geodesic distances between vertices of the same color. We provide characterizations of vertex colorings of paths and cycles whose Wiener index is as large as possible over various natural collections. Along the way we establish a connection between the majorization order on tuples of integers and the Wiener index of vertex colorings on paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. Let $k$ be the number of vertices of such a longest path of $T$ that every vertex of the path is a cut vertex and that every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $T$. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $n+k &lt; N$. A configuration of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A move is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequence of the pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is in $O(Nn + n^2 \log(\min\{n,k\}))$ if $G$ is a $N$-vertex tree, and it is in $O(N^2 + \frac{n^3}{N-n} + n^2 \log(\min\{n,N-n\}))$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. We provide an algorithm that can obtain a solution sequence of lengths that satisfy these orders, with the same computational complexity as the order of the length.

Abstract: Kazhdan and Lusztig introduced the $W$-graphs, which represent the multiplication action of the standard basis on the canonical bais in the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. In the Hecke algebra module, Marberg defined two generalied $W$-graphs, called the Gelfand $W$-graphs. The classification of the molecules of the type $A$ Gelfand $S_n$-graphs are determined by two RSK-like insertion algorithms. We finish the classification of cells by proving that every molecule in the $S_n$-graphs is indeed a cell.</description>

      <title>Recent Progress in Ramsey Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Ramsey numbers $r(s,t)$ denote the minimum $n$ such that every red-blue coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ contains either a red clique of order $s$ or a blue clique of order $t$. These quantities are the centerpiece of graph Ramsey Theory, and have been studied for almost a century. The Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres Theorem (1935) shows that for each $s \geq 2$, $r(s,t) = O(t^{s - 1})$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$. We introduce a new approach using pseudorandom graphs which shows $r(4,t) = \Omega(t^3/(\log t)^4)$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$, answering an old conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, and we illustrate how to apply this approach to many other Ramsey and related combinatorial problems.</description>

      <title>A graphical description of the BNS-invariants of Bestvina-Brady groups and the RAAG recognition problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finitely presented Bestvina-Brady group (BBG) admits a presentation involving only commutators. We show that if a graph admits a certain type of spanning trees, then the associated BBG is a right-angled Artin group (RAAG). As an application, we obtain that the class of BBGs contains the class of RAAGs. On the other hand, we provide a criterion to certify that certain finitely presented BBGs are not isomorphic to RAAGs (or more general Artin groups). This is based on a description of the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariants of finitely presented BBGs in terms of separating subgraphs, analogous to the case of RAAGs. As an application, we characterize when the BBG associated to a 2-dimensional flag complex is a RAAG in terms of certain subgraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The commuting graph of a group $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the elements of $G$, two distinct vertices joined if they commute.
  Our purpose in this paper is twofold: we discuss the computational problem of deciding whether a given graph is the commuting graph of a finite group; we give a quasipolynomial algorithm, and a polynomial algorithm for the case when the group is an extra\-special p-group for p an odd prime; we give new results on the question of whether the commuting graph of a given group is a cograph or a chordal graph, two classes of graphs defined by forbidden subgraphs.
  The problems are not unrelated, since there are a number of cases where hard computational problems on graphs are easier when restricted to special classes of graphs; we conjecture that the recognition problem is polynomial for cographs and chordal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching for $n$ points in the plane. It is known that a deterministic approximation algorithm for this problems must have at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ runtime. We propose such an algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem with runtime $O(n\log n)$ and show that it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.206})$. This improves the so far best known approximation ratio of $n/2$. We also develop an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem in higher dimensions and show it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.412})$ in all fixed dimensions.</description>

      <title>Proof of Merca's stronger conjecture on truncated Jacobi triple product series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of truncated theta series has regained vitality since Andrews and Merca's work on the truncated version of Euler's pentagonal number theorem in 2012. In 2021, Merca proposed a stronger version of the conjecture for the truncated Jacobi triple product series. In this paper, for any given $R, S$ and $k$, we provide a systematic method to determine the lower bound $N$ of $n$ such that when $n\geq N$, Merca's stronger conjecture holds. More precisely, we first treat the infinite $q$-shift factorial in the denominator of the above theta series as the product of the following two parts
  \[ \frac{1}{\left(q^s, q^{r-s}; q^r\right)_{2}}\cdot \frac{1}{\left(q^{2r+s}, q^{3r-s}; q^r\right)_{\infty}}:=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} p_{4}(n)q^n\cdot \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} g_{s,r}(n)q^n,\]
  where $s=S/(S,R),r=R/(S,R)$ are coprime. The first part can be interpreted in terms of partition functions $p_{4}(n) $ which are the number of partitions of $n$ only with parts $s, r+s, r-s, 2r-s$. The second part can be seen as a nonmodular infinite product. For $p_{4}(n)$, we obtained the general upper and lower bounds by using the residue theorem and the properties for partition functions. Further multiplied by the numerator of the theta series, we derive a lower bound of $n$ which satisfies that the coefficients of the subsequent terms are all nonnegative. For $g_{s,r}(n)$, we obtain the lower and upper bounds by applying the circle method on nonmodular infinite products, from which we also deduce an asymptotic formula for $g_{s,r}(n)$. Then, by considering the convolution of these two parts, we confirm Merca's stronger conjecture when $n\geq N $. Consequently, we show that when $k$ is sufficiently large, it only needs to deal with the first part to provide the bound $N $ and Merca's stronger conjecture holds directly for any $S$ and $R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop some model theory of multi-linear forms, generalizing Granger in the bi-linear case. In particular, after proving a quantifier elimination result, we show that for an NIP field K, the theory of infinite dimensional non-degenerate alternating n-linear spaces over K is strictly n-dependent; and it is NSOP1 if K is. This relies on a new Composition Lemma for functions of arbitrary arity and NIP relations (which in turn relies on certain higher arity generalizations of Sauer-Shelah lemma). We also study the invariant connected components $G^{\infty}$ in n-dependent groups, demonstrating their relative absoluteness in the abelian case.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees and the two-branching pseudotree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that each finite chain in the two-branching countable ultrahomogeneous pseudotree has finite big Ramsey degrees. This is in contrast to the recent result of Chodounsk\'{y}, Eskew, and Weinert that antichains of size two have infinite big Ramsey degree in the pseudotree. Combining a lower bound result of theirs with work in this paper shows that chains of length two in the pseudotree have big Ramsey degree exactly seven. The pseudotree is the first example of a countable ultrahomogeneous structure in a finite language in which some finite substructures have finite big Ramsey degrees while others have infinite big Ramsey degrees.</description>
