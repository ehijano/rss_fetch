      <title>Distributions in spaces with thick submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article generalizes the results of [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 512 (2022), Article No. 126075], which presented a theory of distributions (generalized functions) with a singular curve contained in the domain of the test functions. In this present article we construct a theory of distributions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with a ``thick submanifold'', that is, a new theory of thick distributions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose domain contains a submanifold on which test functions may be singular.</description>

      <title>Excess of Fusion Frames: A Comprehensive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the excess as a method of measuring the redundancy of frames was recently introduced to address certain issues in frame theory. In this paper, the concept of excess for the fusion frame setting is studied. Initially, a local approach is presented to determine exactly which part of each subspace should be considered as redundancy. Then, several explicit methods are provided to compute the excess of fusion frames and their $Q$-duals. In particular, some upper bounds for the excess of $Q$-dual fusion frames are established. It turns out that each fusion frame and its $Q$-dual may not necessarily have the same excess. Along the way, unlike ordinary frames, it follows that for every $n \in \Bbb{N}$, we can provide a fusion frame together an its $Q$-dual such that the difference of their excess is $n$. Furthermore, the connection between the excess of fusion frames and their orthogonal complement fusion frames are completely characterized. Finally, several examples are exhibited to confirm the obtained results.</description>

Abstract: Rhaly operators, as generalizations of the Ces\`aro operator, are studied from the standpoint of view of spectral theory and invariant subspaces, extending previous results by Rhaly and Leibowitz to a framework where generalized Ces\`aro operators arise naturally.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of New Type Fourier Integral Operators with Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of Fourier integral operators with weakened symbols, which satisfy a multi-parameter differential inequality in $\R^n$. We establish that these operators retain the classical $L^p$ boundedness and the $H^1$ to $L^1$ boundedness. Notably, the Hardy space considered here is the traditional single-parameter Hardy space rather than a product Hardy space.</description>

      <title>On greedy approximation in complex Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general theory of greedy approximation with respect to arbitrary dictionaries is well developed
  in the case of real Banach spaces. Recently, some of results proved for the Weak Chebyshev Greedy Algorithm (WCGA) in the case of real Banach spaces were extended to the case of complex Banach spaces. In this paper
  we extend some of known in the real case results for other than WCGA greedy algorithms to the case of complex Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Discrete subgroups of normed spaces are free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ancel, Dobrowolski, and Grabowski (Studia Math., 1994) proved that every countable discrete subgroup of the additive group of a normed space is free Abelian, hence isomorphic to the direct sum of a certain number of copies of the additive group of the integers. In the present paper, we take a set-theoretic approach based on the theory of elementary submodels and the Singular Compactness Theorem to remove the cardinality constraint from their result and prove that indeed every discrete subgroup of the additive group of a normed space is free Abelian.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory for $C^2$ long-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a complete stationary scattering theory for Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb R^d$, $d\ge 2$, with $C^2$ long-range potentials. This extends former results in the literature, in particular [Is1, Is2, II, GY], which all require a higher degree of smoothness. In this sense the spirit of our paper is similar to [H\"o2, Chapter XXX], which also develops a scattering theory under the $C^2$ condition, however being very different from ours. While the Agmon-H\"ormander theory is based on the Fourier transform, our theory is not and may be seen as more related to our previous approach to scattering theory on manifolds [IS1,IS2,IS3]. The $C^2$ regularity is natural in the Agmon-H\"ormander theory as well as in our theory, in fact probably being `optimal' in the Euclidean setting. We prove equivalence of the stationary and time-dependent theories by giving stationary representations of associated time-dependent wave operators. Furthermore we develop a related stationary scattering theory at fixed energy in terms of asymptotics of generalized eigenfunctions of minimal growth. A basic ingredient of our approach is a solution to the eikonal equation constructed from the geometric variational scheme of [CS]. Another key ingredient is strong radiation condition bounds for the limiting resolvents originating in [HS]. They improve formerly known ones [Is1, Sa] and considerably simplify the stationary approach. We obtain the bounds by a new commutator scheme whose elementary form allows a small degree of smoothness.</description>

      <title>Large Perturbations of Nest Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ be nests on separable Hilbert space. If the two nest algebras are distance less than 1 ($d(\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{M}),\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{N})) &lt; 1$), then the nests are distance less than 1 ($d(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})&lt;1$). If the nests are distance less than 1 apart, then the nest algebras are similar, i.e. there is an invertible $S$ such that $S\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{N}$, so that $S \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{M})S^{-1} = \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{N})$. However there are examples of nests closer than 1 for which the nest algebras are distance 1 apart.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of vector-valued functions by volume sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ and a finite measure space $\Omega$, the approximation of a vector-valued function $f: \Omega \to \mathcal H$ by a $k$-dimensional subspace $\mathcal U \subset \mathcal H$ plays an important role in dimension reduction techniques, such as reduced basis methods for solving parameter-dependent partial differential equations. For functions in the Lebesgue-Bochner space $L^2(\Omega;\mathcal H)$, the best possible subspace approximation error $d_k^{(2)}$ is characterized by the singular values of $f$. However, for practical reasons, $\mathcal U$ is often restricted to be spanned by point samples of $f$. We show that this restriction only has a mild impact on the attainable error; there always exist $k$ samples such that the resulting error is not larger than $\sqrt{k+1} \cdot d_k^{(2)}$. Our work extends existing results by Binev at al. (SIAM J. Math. Anal., 43(3):1457-1472, 2011) on approximation in supremum norm and by Deshpande et al. (Theory Comput., 2:225-247, 2006) on column subset selection for matrices.</description>

      <title>State-dependent Delay Differential Equations on $H^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classically, solution theories for state-dependent delay equations are developed in spaces of continuous or continuously differentiable functions. The former can be technically challenging to apply in as much as suitably Lipschitz continuous extensions of mappings onto the space of continuous functions are required; whereas the latter approach leads to restrictions on the class of initial pre-histories. Here, we establish a solution theory for state-dependent delay equations for arbitrary Lipschitz continuous pre-histories and suitably Lipschitz continuous right-hand sides on the Sobolev space $H^1$. The provided solution theory is independent of previous ones and is based on the contraction mapping principle on exponentially weighted spaces. In particular, initial pre-histories are not required to belong to solution manifolds and the generality of the approach permits the consideration of a large class of functional differential equations even for which the continuity of the right-hand side has constraints on the derivative.</description>

      <title>Systems of parabolic equations with delays: Continuous dependence on parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Results on continuous dependence on parameters, as well as on regularization, of solutions to linear systems of parabolic partial differential equations of second order with delay are given. One of the main features is that the topology on the zero order and delay coefficients is the weak-* topology on an $L_{\infty}$ space, whereas the assumptions on the second- and first-order coefficients are slightly stronger. This is important in the context of generation of linear skew-product dynamical systems by such equations.</description>
