      <title>Applications of Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the tens of thousands of particle accelerators in operation worldwide, the vast majority are not used for particle physics, but instead for applications. Some applications such as radiotherapy for cancer treatment are well-known, while others are more surprising: food irradiation using electron beams, or the hardening of road tarmac. The uses of particle beams are constantly growing in number including in medicine, industry, security, environment, and cultural heritage preservation. This lecture aims to give a broad sweep of the many uses of particle accelerators, covering technologies ranging in size from a few centimetres for industrial electron linacs through to large synchrotron light sources of hundreds of metres circumference operating as national and international facilities. We finish by discussing some of the challenges facing accelerators used in wider society.</description>

      <title>Conditional Guided Generative Diffusion for Particle Accelerator Beam Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced accelerator-based light sources such as free electron lasers (FEL) accelerate highly relativistic electron beams to generate incredibly short (10s of femtoseconds) coherent flashes of light for dynamic imaging, whose brightness exceeds that of traditional synchrotron-based light sources by orders of magnitude. FEL operation requires precise control of the shape and energy of the extremely short electron bunches whose characteristics directly translate into the properties of the produced light. Control of short intense beams is difficult due to beam characteristics drifting with time and complex collective effects such as space charge and coherent synchrotron radiation. Detailed diagnostics of beam properties are therefore essential for precise beam control. Such measurements typically rely on a destructive approach based on a combination of a transverse deflecting resonant cavity followed by a dipole magnet in order to measure a beam's 2D time vs energy longitudinal phase-space distribution. In this paper, we develop a non-invasive virtual diagnostic of an electron beam's longitudinal phase space at megapixel resolution (1024 x 1024) based on a generative conditional diffusion model. We demonstrate the model's generative ability on experimental data from the European X-ray FEL.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional theory of superradiant free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime, including the effects of beam emittance and energy spread. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of High-Efficiency Microwave Heating Producing Record Highly Charged Xenon Ion Beams with Superconducting ECR Ion Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intense highly charged ion beam production is essential for high-power heavy ion accelerators. A novel movable Vlasov launcher for superconducting high charge state Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source has been devised that can affect the microwave power effectiveness by a factor of about 4 in terms of highly charged ion beam production. This approach based on a dedicated microwave launching system instead of the traditional coupling scheme has led to new insight on microwave-plasma interaction. With this new understanding, the world record highly charged xenon ion beam currents have been enhanced by up to a factor of 2, which could directly and significantly enhance the performance of heavy ion accelerators and provide many new research opportunities in nuclear physics, atomic physics and other disciplines.</description>

      <title>First Scan Search for Dark Photon Dark Matter with a Tunable Superconducting Radio-Frequency Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons have emerged as promising candidates for dark matter, and their search is a top priority in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. We report the first use of a tunable niobium superconducting radio-frequency cavity for a scan search of dark photon dark matter with innovative data analysis techniques. We mechanically adjusted the resonant frequency of a cavity submerged in liquid helium at a temperature of $2$ K, and scanned the dark photon mass over a frequency range of $1.37$ MHz centered at $1.3$ GHz. Our study leveraged the superconducting radio-frequency cavity's remarkably high quality factors of approximately $10^{10}$, resulting in the most stringent constraints to date on a substantial portion of the exclusion parameter space on the kinetic mixing coefficient $\epsilon$ between dark photons and electromagnetic photons, yielding a value of $\epsilon &lt; 2.2 \times 10^{-16}$.</description>
