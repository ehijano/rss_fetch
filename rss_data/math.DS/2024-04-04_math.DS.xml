      <title>Maximal Entropy Measures for Non-Accessible Topological Skew Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a dichotomy for the ergodic measures of maximal entropy for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with one-dimensional compact center leaves which are virtually skew products over (transitive) Anosov homeomorphism. We prove that if the whole manifold is the unique minimal invariant set saturated by unstable foliation, then either there exists a unique measure of maximal entropy which is non-hyperbolic or there are exactly two hyperbolic ergodic measures of maximal entropy.</description>

      <title>A logarithm law for nonautonomous systems fastly converging to equilibrium and mean field coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a nonautonomous system has in a certain sense a fast convergence to equilibrium (faster than any power law behavior) then the time $\tau _{r}(x,y)$ needed for a typical point $x$ to enter for the first time in a ball $B(y,r)$ centered in $y$, with small radius \ $r $ scales as the local dimension of the equilibrium measure \ $\mu $ at $y$, i.e. $$ \underset{r\rightarrow 0}{\lim }\frac{\log \tau _{r}(x,y)}{-\log r}% =d_{\mu }(y).$$
  We then apply the general result to concrete systems of different kind, showing such a logarithm law for asymptotically authonomous solenoidal maps and mean field coupled expanding maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized two-dimensional cubic Lotka-Volterra model with infinitesimal parameters is studied. Three different cases have been considered, one non-degenerate and two degenerate. The local behavior of the model has been studied in the three cases. Six bifurcation diagrams with thirty different regions have been obtained in the non-degenerate case, respectively, sixteen diagrams with forty regions in the two degenerate cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic results for degenerate Chenciner (generalized Neimark-Sacker) bifurcation are obtained in the present work. The bifurcation arises in two-dimensional discrete-time systems with two independent parameters. We define in this work a new transformation of parameters, which enables the study of the bifurcation when the degeneracy occurs. By the four bifurcation diagrams we obtain, new behaviors hidden by the degeneracy are brought to light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Feldman-Katok pseudometric (FK-pseudometric for short) for flows. We then provide a characterization of zero entropy loosely Bernoulli measures for continuous flows via the FK-pseudometric extending the result known for discrete-time dynamical systems. We also provide a purely topological characterization of uniquely ergodic continuous flows whose unique invariant measure is zero entropy loosely Bernoulli.</description>

      <title>Traffic Divergence Theory: An Analysis Formalism for Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic dynamics is universally crucial in analyzing and designing almost any network. This article introduces a novel theoretical approach to analyzing network traffic dynamics. This theory's machinery is based on the notion of traffic divergence, which captures the flow (im)balance of network nodes and links. It features various analytical probes to investigate both spatial and temporal traffic dynamics. In particular, the maximal traffic distribution in a network can be characterized by spatial traffic divergence rate, which reveals the relative difference among node traffic divergence. To illustrate the usefulness, we apply the theory to two network-driven problems: throughput estimation of data center networks and power-optimized communication planning for robot networks, and show the merits of the proposed theory through simulations.</description>

      <title>Stabilization in two-species chemotaxis systems with singular sensitivity and Lotka-Volterra competitive kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current paper is concerned with the stabilization in the following parabolic-parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and Lotka-Volterra competitive kinetics, \begin{equation} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi_1 \nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{w} \nabla w)+u(a_1-b_1u-c_1v) ,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega\cr v_t=\Delta v-\chi_2 \nabla\cdot (\frac{v}{w} \nabla w)+v(a_2-b_2v-c_2u),\quad &amp;x\in \Omega\cr 0=\Delta w-\mu w +\nu u+ \lambda v,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial w}{\partial n}=0,\quad &amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded smooth domain, and $\chi_i,a_i, b_i, c_i$ ($i=1,2$) and $\mu,\, \nu, \, \lambda$ are positive constants. In [25], we proved that for any given nonnegative initial data $u_0,v_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0+v_0\not \equiv 0$, (0.1) has a unique globally defined classical solution provided that $\min\{a_1,a_2\}$ is large relative to $\chi_1,\chi_2$, and $u_0+v_0$ is not small in the case that $(\chi_1-\chi_2)^2\le \max\{4\chi_1,4\chi_2\}$ and $u_0+v_0$ is neither small nor big in the case that $(\chi_1-\chi_2)^2&gt;\max\{4\chi_1,4\chi_2\}$. In this paper, we proved that (0.1) has a unique positive constant solution $(u^*,v^*,w^*)$, where $$ u^*=\frac{a_1b_2-c_1a_2}{b_1b_2-c_1c_2},\quad v^*=\frac{b_1a_2-a_1c_2}{b_1b_2-c_1c_2}, \quad w^*=\frac{\nu}{\mu}u^*+\frac{\lambda}{\mu} v^*. $$ We obtain some explicit conditions on $\chi_1,\chi_2$ which ensure that the positive constant solution $(u^*,v^*,w^*)$ is globally stable in the sense that for any given nonnegative initial data $u_0,v_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0\not \equiv 0$ and $v_0\not \equiv 0$, $$ \lim_{t\to\infty}\Big(\|u(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)-u^*\|_\infty +\|v(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)-v^*\|_\infty+\|w(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)-w^*\|_\infty\Big)=0. $$</description>

      <title>Analytical Characterization of Epileptic Dynamics in a Bistable System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders globally, affecting millions of individuals. Despite significant advancements, the precise mechanisms underlying this condition remain largely unknown, making accurately predicting and preventing epileptic seizures challenging. In this paper, we employ a bistable model, where a stable equilibrium and a stable limit cycle coexist, to describe epileptic dynamics. The equilibrium captures normal steady-state neural activity, while the stable limit cycle signifies seizure-like oscillations. The noise-driven switch from the equilibrium to the limit cycle characterizes the onset of seizures. The differences in the regions of attraction of these two stable states distinguish epileptic brain dynamics from healthy ones. We analytically construct the regions of attraction for both states. Further, using the notion of input-to-state stability, we theoretically show how the regions of attraction influence the stability of the system subject to external perturbations. Generalizing the bistable system into coupled networks, we also find the role of network parameters in shaping the regions of attraction. Our findings shed light on the intricate interplay between brain networks and epileptic activity, offering mechanistic insights into potential avenues for more predictable treatments.</description>

Abstract: Patrick Moss (1947--2024) had two distinct lives as a mathematician. The first was as a ring theorist in the late 1970s, in which he worked with Ginn and Lenagan as a student. After a long career as an inspirational mathematics teacher, Patrick completed a doctorate under my supervision in 2003. This led to a second mathematical life in arithmetic dynamics almost forty years after his first period of research. This is a short obituary of his remarkable contributions, several of which have stimulated further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a controller for an unknown bilinear system using only noisy input-states data points generated by it. The controller should achieve regulation to a given state setpoint and provide a guaranteed basin of attraction. Determining the equilibrium input to achieve that setpoint is not trivial in a data-based setting and we propose the design of a controller in two scenarios. The design takes the form of linear matrix inequalities and is validated numerically for a Cuk converter.</description>

      <title>Toric Promotion with Reflections and Refractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent work on refraction billiards in dynamics, we introduce a notion of refraction for combinatorial billiards. This allows us to define a generalization of toric promotion that we call toric promotion with reflections and refractions, which is a dynamical system defined via a graph $G$ whose edges are partitioned into a set of reflection edges and a set of refraction edges. This system is a discretization of a billiards system in which a beam of light can pass through, reflect off of, or refract through each toric hyperplane in a toric arrangement. Vastly generalizing the main theorem known about toric promotion, we give a simple formula for the orbit structure of toric promotion with reflections and refractions when $G$ is a forest. We also completely describe the orbit sizes when $G$ is a cycle with an even number of refraction edges; this result is new even for ordinary toric promotion (i.e., when there are no refraction edges). When $G$ is a cycle of even size with no reflection edges, we obtain an interesting instance of the cyclic sieving phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Decomposition and factorisation of transients in Functional Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08310v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional graphs (FGs) model the graph structures used to analyse the behaviour of functions from a discrete set to itself. In turn, such functions are used to study real complex phenomena evolving in time. As the systems involved can be quite large, it is interesting to decompose and factorise them into several subgraphs acting together. Polynomial equations over functional graphs provide a formal way to represent this decomposition and factorisation mechanism, and solving them validates or invalidates hypotheses on their decomposability. The current solution method breaks down a single equation into a series of basic equations of the form AxX = B (with A, X, and B being FGs) to identify the possible solutions. However, it is able to consider just FGs made of cycles only. This work proposes an algorithm for solving these basic equations for general connected FGs. By exploiting a connection with the cancellation problem, we prove that the upper bound to the number of solutions is closely related to the size of the cycle in the coefficient A of the equation. The cancellation problem is also involved in the main algorithms provided by the paper. We introduce a polynomial-time semi-decision algorithm able to provide constraints that a potential solution will have to satisfy if it exists. Then, exploiting the ideas introduced in the first algorithm, we introduce a second exponential-time algorithm capable of finding all solutions by integrating several 'hacks' that try to keep the exponential as tight as possible.</description>

More precisely, we prove that for almost every interval exchange transformation $T$ with symmetric combinatorial data, the skew product $T_f: [0, 1) \times \mathbb Z \to [0, 1) \times \mathbb Z$ given by $T_f(x,r)=(T(x),r+f(x))$ is ergodic with respect to the product of the Lebesgue and counting measure.</description>

Abstract: Real vector fields $\dot{z} = f(z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ extend to $\mathbb{C}^N$, for complex entire $f$. One known consequence are exponentially small upper bounds \begin{equation*} \label{*} C_\eta \exp(-\eta/\varepsilon) \tag{*} \end{equation*} on homoclinic splittings under discretizations of step size $\varepsilon&gt;0$, or under rapid forcings of that period. Here the complex time extension of $\Gamma(t)$ is assumed to be analytic in the complex horizontal strip $|\mathrm{Im}\, t|\leq \eta$. The phenomenon relates to adiabatic elimination, infinite order averaging, invisible chaos, and backward error analysis.
  However, what if $\Gamma(t)$ itself were complex entire? Then $\eta$ could be chosen arbitrarily large. We consider connecting orbits $\Gamma(t)$ between limiting hyperbolic equilibria $f(v_\pm)=0$, for real $t\rightarrow\pm\infty$. For the linearizations $f'(v_\pm)$, we assume real eigenvalues which are nonresonant, separately at $v_\pm$. We then show the existence of singularities of $\Gamma(t)$ in complex time $t$. In that sense, real connecting orbits are accompanied by finite time blow-up, in imaginary time. Moreover, the singularities bound admissible $\eta$ in exponential estimates \eqref{*}.
  The cases of complex or resonant eigenvalues are completely open. We therefore offer a 1,000 Euro reward to any mathematician, up to and including non-permanent PostDoc level, who first comes up with a complex entire homoclinic orbit $\Gamma(t)$, in the above setting. Such an example would exhibit ultra-exponentially small separatrix splittings, and ultra-invisible chaos, under discretization.
  We also provide a time-reversible example of an entire periodic orbit with ultra-sharp Arnold tongues, alias ultra-invisible phaselocking, under discretization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.02463v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of spectral invariants in periodic Floer homology (PFH) of area-preserving surface diffeomorphisms. We use this theory to prove $C^\infty$ closing lemmas for certain Hamiltonian isotopy classes of area-preserving surface diffeomorphisms. In particular, we show that for a $C^\infty$-generic area-preserving diffeomorphism of the torus, the set of periodic points is dense. Our closing lemmas are quantitative, asserting roughly speaking that for a given Hamiltonian isotopy, within time $\delta$ a periodic orbit must appear of period $O(\delta^{-1})$. We also prove a "Weyl law" describing the asymptotic behavior of PFH spectral invariants.</description>

Abstract: We expand the calculation of the upper bound on epidemic overshoot in SIR models to account for nonlinear incidence. We lay out the general procedure and restrictions to perform the calculation analytically. We demonstrate the procedure by working through several examples and also numerically study what happens to the upper bound on overshoot when nonlinear incidence manifests in the form of epidemic dynamics over a contact network. We find that both steeper incidence terms and larger contact heterogeneity can increase the range of communicable diseases at which the overshoot remains a relatively large public health hazard.</description>

      <title>On dynamically convex contact manifolds and filtered symplectic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we are interested in characterizing the standard contact sphere in terms of dynamically convex contact manifolds which admit a Liouville filling with vanishing symplectic homology. We first observe that if the filling is flexible, then those contact manifolds are contactomorphic to the standard contact sphere. We then investigate quantitative geometry of those contact manifolds focusing on similarities with the standard contact sphere in filtered symplectic homology.</description>

      <title>Convective stability in scalar balance laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We fill the two main remaining gaps in the full classification of non-degenerate planar traveling waves of scalar balance laws from the point of view of spectral and nonlinear stability/instability under smooth perturbations. On one hand we investigate the impact on the classification of allowing to restrict perturbations by further localization constraints, the so-called convective stability analysis. On the other hand, in the multidimensional case we extend the existing analysis to general perturbations, relaxing the artificial restriction, assumed so far, that initial perturbations are supported away from characteristic points. A striking feature of the latter analysis is that it involves infinite-dimensional families of genuinely multidimensional traveling waves that live near the perturbed planar traveling wave.</description>
