      <title>Metastability, atmospheric midlatitude circulation regimes and large-scale teleconnection: a data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-frequency variability of the mid-latitude atmosphere involves complex nonlinear and chaotic dynamical processes posing predictability challenges. It is characterized by sporadically recurring, often long-lived patterns of atmospheric circulation of hemispheric scale known as weather regimes. The evolution of these circulation regimes in addition to their link to large-scale teleconnections can help extend the limits of atmospheric predictability. They also play a key role in sub- and inter-seasonal weather forecasting. Their identification and modeling remains an issue, however, due to their intricacy, including a clear conceptual picture. In recent years, the concept of metastability has been developed to explain regimes formation. This suggests an interpretation of circulation regimes as communities of states in which the atmospheric system remains in their neighborhood for abnormally longer than typical baroclinic timescales. Here we develop a new and effective method to identify such communities by constructing and analyzing an operator of the system's evolution via hidden Markov model (HMM). The method makes use of graph theory and is based on probabilistic approach to partition the HMM transition matrix into weakly interacting blocks -- communities of hidden states -- associated with regimes. The approach involves nonlinear kernel principal component mapping to consistently embed the system state space for HMM building. Application to northern winter hemisphere using geopotential heights from reanalysis yields four persistent and recurrent circulation regimes. Statistical and dynamical characteristics of these circulation regimes and surface impacts are discussed. In particular, unexpected high correlations are obtained with EL-Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific decadal oscillation with lead times of up to one year.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Constrained Neural Differential Equation Framework for Data-Driven Snowpack Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-constrained neural differential equation framework for parameterization, and employs it to model the time evolution of seasonal snow depth given hydrometeorological forcings. When trained on data from multiple SNOTEL sites, the parameterization predicts daily snow depth with under 9% median error and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiencies over 0.94 across a wide variety of snow climates. The parameterization also generalizes to new sites not seen during training, which is not often true for calibrated snow models. Requiring the parameterization to predict snow water equivalent in addition to snow depth only increases error to ~12%. The structure of the approach guarantees the satisfaction of physical constraints, enables these constraints during model training, and allows modeling at different temporal resolutions without additional retraining of the parameterization. These benefits hold potential in climate modeling, and could extend to other dynamical systems with physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Io's SO2 and NaCl Wind Fields From ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved measurements of SO$_2$ and NaCl winds on Io at several unique points in its orbit: before and after eclipse, and at maximum eastern and western elongation. The derived wind fields represent a unique case of meteorology in a rarified, volcanic atmosphere. Through the use of Doppler shift measurements in emission spectra obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) between $\sim346$-430GHz ($\sim0.70$-0.87 mm), line-of-sight winds up to $\sim-100$ m s$^{-1}$ in the approaching direction and &gt;250 m s$^{-1}$ in the receding direction were derived for SO$_2$ at altitudes of $\sim10$-50 km, while NaCl winds consistently reached $\sim$|150-200| m s$^{-1}$ in localized regions up to $\sim30$ km above the surface. The wind distributions measured at maximum east and west Jovian elongations, and on the subJovian hemisphere pre- and post-eclipse, were found to be significantly different and complex, corroborating the results of simulations that include surface temperature and frost distribution, volcanic activity, and interactions with the Jovian magnetosphere. Further, the wind speeds of SO$_2$ and NaCl are often inconsistent in direction and magnitude, indicating that the processes that drive the winds for the two molecular species are different and potentially uncoupled; while the SO$_2$ wind field can be explained through a combination of sublimation-driven winds, plasma torus interactions, and plume activity, the NaCl winds appear to be primarily driven by the plasma torus.</description>

      <title>Tides on Lava Worlds: Application to Close-in Exoplanets and the Early Earth-Moon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of planetary magma oceans has been the subject of growing efforts, in light of the increasing abundance of Solar system samples and extrasolar surveys. A rocky planet harboring such an ocean is likely to interact tidally with its host star, planetary companions, or satellites. To date, however, models of the tidal response and heat generation of magma oceans have been restricted to the framework of weakly viscous solids, ignoring the dynamical fluid behavior of the ocean beyond a critical melt fraction. Here we provide a handy analytical model that accommodates this phase transition, allowing for a physical estimation of the tidal response of lava worlds. We apply the model in two settings: The tidal history of the early Earth-Moon system in the aftermath of the giant impact; and the tidal interplay between short-period exoplanets and their host stars. For the former, we show that the fluid behavior of the Earth's molten surface drives efficient early Lunar recession to ${\sim} 25$ Earth radii within $10^4{-} 10^5$ years, in contrast with earlier predictions. For close-in exoplanets, we report on how their molten surfaces significantly change their spin-orbit dynamics, allowing them to evade spin-orbit resonances and accelerating their track towards tidal synchronization from a Gyr to Myr timescale. Moreover, we re-evaluate the energy budgets of detected close-in exoplanets, highlighting how the surface thermodynamics of these planets are likely controlled by enhanced, fluid-driven tidal heating, rather than vigorous insolation, and how this regime change substantially alters predictions for their surface temperatures.</description>

      <title>Project Severe Weather Archive of the Philippines (SWAP). Part 1: Establishing a Baseline Climatology for Severe Weather across the Philippine Archipelago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03211v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the rudimentary reporting methods and general lack of documentation, the creation of a severe weather database within the Philippines has been difficult yet relevant target for climatology purposes and historical interest. Previous online severe weather documentation i.e. of tornadoes, waterspouts, and hail events, has also often been few, inconsistent, inactive, or is now completely decommissioned. Several countries or continents support severe weather information through either government-sponsored or independent organizations. For this work, Project SWAP stands as a collaborative exercise, with clear data attribution and open avenues for augmentation, and the creation of a common data model to store the phenomenon's information will assist in maintaining and updating the aforementioned online archive in the Philippines. This paper presents the methods necessary for creating the SWAP database, provide broader climatological analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in severe weather occurrence within the Philippine context, and outline potential use cases for the data. We also highlight the project's current limitations as is to any other existing and far larger database, and emphasize the need for understanding these events' and their mesoscale environments, inline to the current severe weather climatologies across the globe.</description>
