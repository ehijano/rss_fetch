      <title>High-Resolution Modelling of Coronae and Winds in Solar-type Stars with Varying Rotation Rates I. X-ray Coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar coronae are believed to be the main birthplace of various stellar magnetic activities. However, the structures and properties of stellar coronae remain poorly understood. Using the Space Weather Modelling Framework with the Alfv\'{e}n Wave Solar Model (SWMF-AWSoM) and dynamo-generated surface magnetic maps, here we model the coronae of four solar-type stars. By incorporating the Sun, our work covers a range of stars with the rotation varying from 1.0 to 23.3 $\Omega_\odot$ (periods of 25 to 1 days). Guided by observations, we scale the magnetic field strength with increasing rotation, covering a range between 6.0 G to 1200 G approximately. In our models, energy release associated with small-scale magnetic flux is a key source of coronal heating and is essential for reproducing realistic coronal structures. Our models capture dense (1$-$2 orders of magnitude higher than solar values) and ultra-hot ($\sim 10\,\mathrm{MK}$) coronae dominated by closed field structures. Using the CHIANTI atomic database, we also compute synthetic X-ray spectra and derive the corresponding X-ray luminosities $(L_X)$, which follow a scaling law to magnetic field $L_X \propto \langle|\mathbf{B}|\rangle^{1.75}$. Furthermore, the coronal X-ray emission is found to be rotationally modulated by the alternating presence of bright active regions and dark coronal holes. These results provide new insights into the extremely high-energy coronae of rapidly rotating solar-type stars, which differ markedly from the Sun.</description>

      <title>Beyond OCCAM: Measuring Optical Neutron Capture Abundances of Open Cluster Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open clusters have long been used to determine ages of stars, as well as calibrate stellar evolution models and other methods of age-dating stellar groups, e.g., gyrochronology, asteroseismology, and chemical clocks. In this work, we have obtained new high-resolution (R $\ge$ 50,000), high-S/N, optical data for 3+ stellar members in open clusters, using Keck/HIRES, with membership derived from the Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey. From these new Keck/HIRES data, we have derived neutron capture abundances for stars in seven distant outer Galaxy open cluster</description>

      <title>Abundance of heavy r-process elements in CEMP-rs stars: The role of the i-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are ancient stars enriched in carbon and heavy elements. Some of these stars exhibit enhanced s-process and/or r-process elements, hence are classified as CEMP-s, CEMP-rs, or CEMP-r. This classification is challenging due to the limited availability of heavy element abundances, particularly among r-process elements. Heavy r-process elements such as terbium, holmium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, tantalum, and iridium have rarely been measured because their sensitive lines are located in the ultraviolet. However, they provide sensitive diagnostics of the s-, r-, and i- nucleosynthetic processes. In this work, we aim to obtain a secure classification of CEMP-s and -rs stars and investigate whether the i-process can account for the measured abundance patterns in CEMP-rs stars. We derive the abundance profiles, notably for twelve heavy r-elements, including, in some cases, tantalum, using high-resolution UVES spectra of seventeen CEMP-s and -rs stars. Based on indicators such as the [s/r] abundance ratio or the model-independent 'abundance distance', nine stars are confirmed as CEMP-rs and six as CEMP-s. The classification of two objects remains uncertain. The i-process satisfactorily reproduces the abundance patterns of CEMP-rs stars. However, larger samples are needed to confirm trends with metallicity and clarify how CEMP-rs stars differ from CEMP-s stars.</description>

      <title>ON the stability of triangular Lagrangian points in the spatial restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, which is a development of an earlier study by the author \cite{Sosnitskii08}, we consider the stability of triangular libration points in the spatial circular restricted three-body problem and improve the result of author's work \cite{Sosnitskii08}. Unlike \cite{Sosnitskii08}, where the instability of libration points was established on the base of reduced approximate equations, we succeeded in this paper to use a new approach that made it possible to prove the instability of triangular libration points on the base of a closed complete system of equations. The relationship between the Lyapunov stability and Birkhoff stability (formal stability) is also discussed</description>

      <title>Recent progress on interstellar radionuclides on Earth and the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of interstellar radionuclides in geological archives provides insights into nucleosynthesis in stars and stellar explosions as well as interstellar medium dynamics in the Local Bubble and the Local Interstellar Cloud. In this work, current projects to detect interstellar radionuclides with accelerator mass spectrometry will be reviewed. These projects aim to address unsolved questions regarding the timing and the origin of the influxes and to establish new radionuclides for future searches. For the first time, experimental evidence for an inhomogeneous deposition of interstellar 60Fe onEarthwill be presented and another potential source for 60Fe on Earth and the Moon, primary galactic cosmic rays, will be introduced.</description>

      <title>Measuring the precise photometric period of the probable intermediate polar 1RXS J014549.6+514314 based on extensive photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, in the VSX database, G. Murawski reported the discovery of an oscillation with a period of about 40 min in the probable cataclysmic variable 1RXS J014549.6+514314. To confirm the existence of this oscillation and precisely measure its period, I conducted extensive photometric observations of the object over 25 nights between 2022 and 2024. The total duration of these observations was 139 hr. The observations revealed the oscillation on each observation night. This oscillation was coherent throughout all the observations covering 18 months. Due to the large coverage of observations, I was able to determine the oscillation period with high precision. It was found to be 41.485867+\-0.000026 min. The semi-amplitude of the oscillation was large, averaging 0.154(2) mag. The pulse profile of the oscillation did not change during the observations and followed a perfect sinusoidal pattern. With the high precision of the period, I created an ephemeris for the oscillation with a validity time of 30 years. This ephemeris can be used in future studies of changes in the oscillation period. Although short-period X-ray oscillations have not yet been detected in 1RXS J014549.6+514314, the high coherence of its 41-minute oscillation suggests that this object is most likely to be an intermediate polar.</description>

      <title>The Supernova 1987A system and its recent evolution - a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova 1987A was the closest supernova event to be observed in nearly 400 years. The outflowing ejecta from the explosion continues to interact with extended circumstellar material and with the equatorial ring (ER) in the triple ring system, while observations of the system have continued across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. This review mainly focuses on works published over the past ten years on Supernova 1987A and its remnant. These include (a) submillimetre, infrared and X-ray studies of molecules, ions and dust in the ejecta, and (b) infrared, optical and X-ray studies of dust and ionized gas in the ER and in the surrounding circumstellar medium, including their time evolution as the ER is shocked and eroded by the impact of high velocity ejecta. Since 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope has become available for high angular resolution infrared observations of Supernova 1987A and has made significant contributions to both (a) and (b) above. Its discovery of redshifted narrow-line emission from multiple ion species located at the centre of the ejecta strongly requires the presence there of either a cooling hot neutron star, or a pulsar wind nebula, to power the emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial velocity searches may lead to detection of exoplanets at large orbital separations only if long-enough time-series of data are available. Therefore publication of precise measurements collected in the past is very valuable even if not successfully completed with a definitive detection. Here we present 309 precise ($\sigma$RV$\approx$5-7 m s$^{-1}$) multi-epoch radial velocities for 28 stars observed with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and its High Resolution Spectrograph between 2004 and 2013. Based on the observations gathered we present a low mass companion ($m_{p}\sin{i}$ = 10.6 $M_{J}$ in 1887.76 $\pm$ 0.01 d, 4.65 au orbit with $e$ = 0.59 $\pm$ 0.01) to a K giant BD+37 3172 ($M$=3.75$\pm$ 0.86 M$_{\odot}$), and a planetary mass companion (m$_{p}\sin{i}$=0.55 M$_{J}$ in 123.05$\pm$0.04 day, 0.55 au orbit with e=0.73$\pm$0.03) to a K giant BD+42 2315 ($M$=1.38$\pm$ 0.30 M$_{\odot}$). We also present two preliminary detections of new spectroscopic binaries: BD+56 2957 (K5) and HD 236555 (G5).</description>

      <title>The collision and merger products of stars do not look alike: A magnetohydrodynamics comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of stars experience close interactions, including collisions resulting from gravitational encounters and mergers within close binary systems. These processes can produce more massive stars that may give rise to relatively rare objects such as blue stragglers. Distinguishing the outcomes of collisions and mergers is challenging yet essential for interpreting observations. This study utilizes the magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO to simulate collisions and mergers of $5$ to $10 \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ main-sequence stars, systematically comparing the properties of the resulting products. Both collisions and mergers yield more massive, strongly magnetized, rapidly and differentially rotating stars with cores enriched in hydrogen, but notable quantitative differences emerge. Merger products exhibit core hydrogen fractions up to $10\%$ higher than those of collision products. In both scenarios, turbulent mixing amplifies magnetic field energies by $9$ to $12$ orders of magnitude. However, magnetic fields in small-impact-parameter collision products display small-scale reversals that may dissipate over time, whereas merger products and large-impact-parameter collision products develop large-scale ordered, potentially long-lived magnetic fields. Additionally, only merger products display magnetically driven, bipolar outflows with radial velocities exceeding $300$ to $400 \,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. These distinctions may result in divergent long-term evolutionary outcomes, which warrant further investigation in future studies.</description>

      <title>Only the Special Survive: Evolution of Long-Lived Star Clusters in Galaxy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to answer one crucial question behind the discrepancy between chemical trends of field stars and clusters in the Galactic disk: is the chemical gradient mismatch driven by cluster migration and differential survivability as a function of galactic location? To answer this question, we explored the evolution of long-lived (&gt; 1 Gyr) star clusters in Milky Way-galaxy simulations. In particular, we investigated why some star clusters remain bound over billions of years. We have traced the unique trajectories for a sample of open clusters around two FIRE galaxies throughout cosmic time. Additionally, we characterized the small-scale environment surrounding these clusters over their orbital history. We see that clusters across both FIRE galaxies spend the majority of their lives in under-dense regions of gas, except for brief passages where they interact with gas clouds, causing their orbits to be altered.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Pretraining and Domain Adaptation for Astronomical Time Series with Minimal Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical time-series analysis faces a critical limitation: the scarcity of labeled observational data. We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of compressible isothermal turbulence from sub- to supersonic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the statistical properties of isothermal turbulence in both the subsonic and supersonic regimes. The focus is on the influence of the Mach number ($Ma$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$) on both the space-local and scale-dependent fluctuations of relevant gas variables, the density, velocity, their derivatives, and the kinetic energy. We carry out hydrodynamical simulations with explicit viscosity and therefore controlled $Re$. We confirm previous work that the probability density functions (PDFs) of the gas density are approximately log-normal and depend on $Ma$. In contrast, derivatives of the density and velocity field are sensitive to $Re$, with the probability of extreme events growing with $Re$. The PDFs of the density gradient and velocity divergence (dilatation) exhibit increasingly heavy tails with growing $Ma$, signalling enhanced internal intermittency. At sufficiently high $Ma$, the statistics of dilatation are observed to saturate at a level determined solely by $Re$, suggesting that turbulent dilatation becomes limited by viscous effects. We also examine the scale-by-scale distribution of kinetic energy through a compressible form of the K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin (KHM) equation. In the intermediate range of scales, a marked difference is found between subsonic and supersonic turbulence: while Kolmogorov-like scaling applies in the sub- and transonic regimes, supersonic turbulence aligns more closely with Burgers turbulence predictions. The analysis of individual terms in the KHM equation highlights the role of the pressure-velocity coupling as an additional mechanism for converting kinetic energy from large to small scales. Moreover, the contributions of the KHM terms exhibit non-monotonic behaviour with increasing $Ma$, with dilatational effects becoming more pronounced and acting to oppose the cascade of kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Hyperons and $\Delta$'s in rotating protoneutron stars: Local properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural evolution of rotating protoneutron stars encodes essential information about their observable signatures, while microscopic properties provide complementary knowledge to advance observational investigations. Using a relativistic mean-field model with density-dependent couplings that account for temperature and particle composition, we investigate rotation, neutrino-emission-driven changes in angular momentum, particle distributions, temperature profiles, and sound speed to probe the internal dynamics of protoneutron star matter. Additionally, we track the evolution of macroscopic quantities such as energy distribution and gravitational mass and establish direct links between microphysics and global evolution. Extending the framework of Phys. Rev. D 112, 023007 (2025), which focuses on the global properties of rotating protoneutron star evolution, our results reveal that protoneutron star deformation and thermal evolution are governed by angular momentum, mass, and composition. Exotic matter (hyperons and $\Delta$-resonances) and rapid rotation enhance deformation leading to a reduction in core temperature, whereas slowly rotating stars like PSR J0740$+$6620 remain nearly spherical. Our predicted equatorial radii for PSR J0740$+$6620, $13.0\ \mathrm{km} &lt; R_e &lt; 13.5\ \mathrm{km}$, are consistent with NICER measurements. These findings constrain the EoS, requiring a self-consistent treatment of rotation, mass-dependent compression, and composition-driven modeling to accurately model protoneutron star evolution in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Solar Cycle Variation of Sustained Gamma-ray Emission Events from the Sun and Related Energetic Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) from the Sun is one of the fascinating high energy phenomena closely related to the acceleration of protons to energies &gt;300 MeV. Here we report on the solar cycle variation of SGRE events based on observations from Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT). This report covers solar cycles (SCs) 24 and 25 during which Fermi has been operating. Since SGRE events are closely related to solar energetic particle (SEP) events and interplanetary type II radio bursts caused by fast and wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we consider these phenomena as well. Many studies have shown that SC 25 is similar or slightly stronger than SC 24. The number of SEP events, GLE events, IP type II bursts, and fast and wide CMEs confirm this conclusion. However, the number of SGRE events observed by Fermi LAT has diminished significantly in SC 25 relative to SC 24. One of the issues has been the reduced coverage of the Sun since 2018 due to a mechanical problem with a solar array of the Fermi mission. By identifying the Fermi LAT gaps and the number of energetic events (fast and wide CMEs, interplanetary type II bursts) we conclude that about three times more SGRE events must have occurred than the 15 events observed by Fermi.</description>

      <title>Condensation sequence of circumstellar cluster seeds (CSCCS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, the condensation sequence of circumstellar dust is predicted based on the thermodynamic stabilities of specific condensates in the macroscopic bulk phase. However, at the (sub-)nanometer scale clusters with non-crystalline structures and significantly different properties are energetically favoured. For this reason, we study the thermodynamic stabilities of metal oxide clusters with generic stoichiometries of M$_2$O$_3$ and M$_3$O$_4$, where M represents a metal atom. With an upper size limit of 50 atoms, we consider clusters with sizes n=1$-$10 for (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, and n=1$-$7 for (M$_3$O$_4$)$_n$. The M$_2$O$_3$ clusters comprise alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), Mg-rich pyroxene (MgSiO$_3$) and a size-limited sample of titanates (CaTiO$_3$), whereas the M$_3$O$_4$ clusters include spinel (MgAl$_2$O$_4$), Mg-rich olivine (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and calcium aluminates (CaAl$_2$O$_4$). We find that, apart from the alumina monomer, the aluminum-bearing clusters (Al$_2$O$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10, and (MgAl$_2$O$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7, are favoured over their silicate counterparts (MgSiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$10 and (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$)$_n$, n=1$-$7. Also, we find that calcium aluminate clusters, CaAl$_2$O$_4$, are energetically more favourable than magnesium aluminate clusters, MgAl$_2$O$_4$. Furthermore, for a limited data set of (CaTiO$_3$)$_n$, n=1$-$2, clusters we find significantly larger stabilities than for the other considered (M$_2$O$_3$)$_n$ clusters, namely Al$_2$O$_3$ and MgSiO$_3$. Future investigations, in particular on titanates and on Ca-rich silicates, are required to draw a more thorough and complete picture of the condensation sequence at the (sub-)nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Double-faced white dwarfs and the magnetic inhibition of convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: About one in five white dwarfs undergoes spectral evolution from a helium atmosphere to hydrogen and then back to helium. These short-lived hydrogen envelopes - the result of residual hydrogen diffusion - are eventually destroyed by either hydrogen or helium convection. An emerging class of double-faced white dwarfs seems to catch this process in the act, with varying amounts of hydrogen across regions of the stellar surface. Here, we quantitatively test the hypothesis that these inhomogeneities are the result of the magnetic inhibition of convection. We compute the critical magnetic field $B_{\rm crit}(M,T_{\rm eff})$ required to inhibit convection in both hydrogen and helium for $0.6-1.2\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs using two methods. Initially, we estimated $B_{\rm crit}\sim\sqrt{8\pi P}$ where $P$ is the pressure at the base of the convection zone, finding that most (three out of four) of the observed magnetic double-faced white dwarfs could potentially be explained by the magnetic inhibition of hydrogen convective energy transfer, with measured $B\gtrsim B_{\rm crit}^{\rm H}$. Then, we incorporated the magnetic field consistently into the stellar structure and directly computed the boundary of convective mixing. With this more appropriate method, we find that only half (two out of four) of the stars could be explained by the magnetic inhibition of helium convection, with $B\gtrsim B_{\rm crit}^{\rm He}$. Specifically, order of unity variations in the magnetic field's strength or orientation across the surface could account for the double-faced nature of these stars. Given our mixed results, other - including non-magnetic - scenarios should be considered as well.</description>

      <title>The EBLM project XVI. Spin-orbit alignment of the low mass eclipsing binary EBLM J0021-16</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thousands of tight ($&lt;1$ AU) main sequence binaries have been discovered, but it is uncertain how they formed. There is likely too much angular momentum in a collapsing, fragmenting protostellar cloud to form such binaries in situ, suggesting some post processing. One probe of a binary's dynamical history is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, but to less than a dozen stellar binaries. In this paper, we present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of EBLM J0021-16, a $0.19M_\odot$ M-dwarf eclipsing a $1.05M_\odot$ G-dwarf on a 5.97 day, almost-circular orbit. We combine CORALIE spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses and star spot modulation. We show that the orbital axis is well-aligned with the primary star's spin axis, with a true 3D obliquity of $\psi=4.01\pm0.54^{\circ}$. EBLM J0021-16 becomes one of only a handful of eclipsing binaries where a true obliquity has been measured. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf's mass and radius to a fractional precision better than 1\%. The radius of the M dwarf is inflated by 6\% ($7.4\sigma$) with respect to stellar models, consistent with many other M-dwarfs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Empirical Optimization of the Source-Surface Height in the PFSS extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential field source surface (PFSS) method is a widely used magnetic field extrapolation technique in the space weather community. The only free parameter in the PFSS method is the source-surface height ($R_{\rm SS}$), beyond which all field lines are open. Although $R_{\rm SS}$ is known to vary with solar activity, there is no consensus on how to determine it for a given surface magnetic field distribution. In this study, we investigate the nature of $R_{\rm SS}$ using a long-period (2006-2023) data, covering two solar minima and one maximum. We adopt ADAPT-GONG magnetograms and determine $R_{\rm SS}$ by matching the open flux estimated from observations at 1 au with that calculated using the PFSS method. Our analysis reveals that $R_{\rm SS}$ increases slightly after the solar minima and around the solar maximum, and that it can be characterized by both the mean unsigned photospheric magnetic field strength and the dipolarity parameter $f_{\rm dip}$, defined as $f_{\rm dip} = B_{\rm dip}^2/(B_{\rm dip}^2 + B_{\rm quad}^2 + B_{\rm oct}^2)$, with $B_{\rm dip}$, $B_{\rm quad}$, and $B_{\rm oct}$ denoting the magnitudes of dipolar, quadrupolar, and octupolar components of photospheric radial magnetic field, respectively. Our results suggest that $R_{\rm SS}$ does not exhibit a simple monotonic dependence on the solar activity and must be determined by properly considering both surface magnetic field strength and global field structure.</description>

      <title>Polarization from Rapidly Rotating Massive Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar rotation has long been recognized as important to the evolution of stars, by virtue of the chemical mixing it can induce and how it interacts with binary mass transfer. Binary interaction and rapid rotation are both common in massive stars and involve processes of angular momentum distribution and transport. An important question is how this angular momentum transport leads to the creation of two important classes of rapidly rotating massive stars, Be stars defined by disklike emission lines, and Bn stars defined by rotationally broadened absorption lines. A related question is what limits this rotation places on how conservative the mass transfer can be. Central to addressing these issues is knowledge of how close to rotational break-up stars can get before they produce a disk. Here we calculate diagnostics of this rotational criticality using the continuum polarization arising from a combination of rotational stellar distortion (i.e., oblateness) and redistribution of stellar flux (i.e., gravity darkening), and compare polarizations produced in the von Zeipel approximation with the approach of Espinosa Lara &amp; Rieutord (ELR). Both produce similar photospheric polarizations that rise significantly in the far ultraviolet (FUV) for B stars, with a stronger signal in the von Zeipel case. For early main-sequence and subgiant stars, it reaches a maximum of ~1% at 140 nm for stars rotating at 98% of critical, when seen edge-on. Rotational rates above 80% critical result in polarizations of several tenths of a percent, at high inclination. These predicted stable signal strengths indicate that determinations of near-critical rotations in B stars could be achieved with future spectropolarimetric instrumentation that can reach deep into the FUV, such as CASSTOR, the Polstar mission concept, or the POLLUX detector design.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantification of Observability and Equation of State of Twin Stars</title>

Abstract: The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the second branch. The possibility of twin stars remains robust even under recent observational constraints. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>CO desorption from interstellar icy grains induced by IR excitation of superhydrogenated PAHs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) radiation dominates dense, interstellar clouds, yet its effect on icy grains remains largely unexplored. Its potential role in driving the photodesorption of volatile species from such grains has recently been demonstrated, providing a crucial link between the solid state reservoir of molecules and the gas phase. In this work, we investigate IR-induced photodesorption of CO for astrophysically relevant ice systems containing perhydropyrene (PHP). This fully superhydrogenated version of pyrene is used as an analogue for large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related species, as well as hydrogenated carbonaceous grains. The abundance and range of strong IR absorption bands of these carbonaceous species make them interesting candidates for IR-induced effects. We present IR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric measurements probing the effects of IR radiation on two ice systems: a layered ice with CO on top of PHP, and a CO:PHP mixed ice. These ices were irradiated with IR radiation from the FELIX IR Free Electron Laser (FEL) FEL-2. In accordance with previous studies, we confirm that direct excitation of CO is not an efficient pathway to CO desorption, indicating that another energy dissipation mechanism exists. We demonstrate that vibrational excitation of the PHP CH stretching modes leads to efficient CO photodesorption. The derived photodesorption yields are an order of magnitude higher for the layered than the mixed system and comparable to those previously obtained for CO photodesorption from CO on amorphous solid water upon excitation of H$_2$O vibrational modes. Our results indicate that IR excitation of carbonaceous molecules and grains in dense clouds could potentially play an important role in the desorption of volatile species such as CO from icy grains.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency spectra of neutron star + OB supergiant binaries: Does wind density drive persistent and flaring modes of accretion?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star high-mass X-ray binaries are well-studied in wavebands between the infrared and hard X-rays. Their low-frequency millimeter and radio properties, on the other hand, remain poorly understood. We present observations of the millimeter and radio emission of binaries where a neutron star accretes from an OB supergiant. We report ALMA and NOEMA millimeter observations of twelve systems, supplemented by VLA radio observations of six of those targets. Our targets include six Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs), four Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), and two intermediate systems. Nine out of twelve targets, including all SFXTs, are detected in at least one millimeter band, while in the radio, only two targets are detected. All detected targets display inverted radio/millimeter spectra, with spectral indices in the range $\alpha =0.6-0.8$ for those systems where accurate SED fits could be performed. We conclude, firstly, that the low-frequency SEDs of neutron star SFXTs and SgXBs are dominated by free-free emission from the OB supergiant's stellar wind, and that jet emission is unlikely to be observed unless the systems can be detected at sub-GHz frequencies. Secondly, we find that SFXTs are fainter at 100 GHz than prototypical SgXBs, probably due to systematically less dense winds in the former, as supported further by the differences in their fluorescence Fe K$\alpha$ lines. We furthermore compare the stellar wind constraints obtained from our millimeter observations with those from IR/optical/UV studies and bow shock detections, and present evidence for long-term stellar wind variability visible in the thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Advancing Interstellar Science: A Global Framework for Comprehensive Study of Interstellar Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The operation of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) marks a transformative moment in humanity's capacity to detect and characterize interstellar objects (ISOs). With projections indicating an increase from a few detections per decade to potentially one every few months, humanity stands at the threshold of unprecedented scientific opportunity offering revolutionary insights into the nature of rocky materials, building blocks of life and technological products from other star systems. This white paper proposes the establishment of the United Nations Committee on Interstellar Objects (UNCIO), a specialized body designed to coordinate global scientific research, maximize observational coverage, and ensure optimal scientific return from these extraordinary objects from outside the solar system through systematic investigation in cosmochemistry, astrobiology, planetary sciences, fundamental physics, advanced technologies and materials science. The proposed framework addresses critical gaps in our current international infrastructure: the absence of coordinated detection, classification and intercept capabilities, insufficient protocols for rapid scientific response and international policy decisions to time-sensitive observations, and the need for effective science communication to maintain government and public support for these ambitious investigations and global threats to Earth. Drawing from successful international collaborations in areas such as the International Space Station (ISS) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), UNCIO would operate through a dual structure: an executive board for time-critical scientific decisions and an expanded committee for comprehensive stakeholder representation. This initiative is not merely aspirational but urgently practical.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (&gt; 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>
