      <title>Modeling Alzheimer's Disease: From Memory Loss to Plaque &amp; Tangles Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Hopfield model as a simplified framework to explore both the memory deficits and the biochemical processes characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. By simulating neuronal death and synaptic degradation through increasing the number of stored patterns and introducing noise into the synaptic weights, we demonstrate hallmark symptoms of dementia, including memory loss, confusion, and delayed retrieval times. As the network's capacity is exceeded, retrieval errors increase, mirroring the cognitive confusion observed in Alzheimer's patients. Additionally, we simulate the impact of synaptic degradation by varying the sparsity of the weight matrix, showing impaired memory recall and reduced retrieval success as noise levels increase. Furthermore, we extend our model to connect memory loss with biochemical processes linked to Alzheimer's. By simulating the role of reduced insulin sensitivity over time, we show how it can trigger increased calcium influx into mitochondria, leading to misfolded proteins and the formation of amyloid plaques. These findings, modeled over time, suggest that both neuronal degradation and metabolic factors contribute to the progressive decline seen in Alzheimer's disease. Our work offers a computational framework for understanding the dual impact of synaptic and metabolic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Dual Stream Graph Transformer Fusion Networks for Enhanced Brain Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the novel Dual Stream Graph-Transformer Fusion (DS-GTF) architecture designed specifically for classifying task-based Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. In the spatial stream, inputs are initially represented as graphs, which are then passed through graph attention networks (GAT) to extract spatial patterns. Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT. In the temporal stream, the Transformer Encoder receives concatenated windowed input MEG data and learns new temporal representations. The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer. Experimental results demonstrate an enhancement in classification performance and a reduction in standard deviation across multiple test subjects compared to other examined models.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Graph Neural Networks for Neurological Evaluation on EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After an acute stroke, accurately estimating stroke severity is crucial for healthcare professionals to effectively manage patient's treatment. Graph theory methods have shown that brain connectivity undergoes frequency-dependent reorganization post-stroke, adapting to new conditions. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features that may not capture the complexities of clinical phenomena. In this study, we propose a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). We analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 71 patients at the time of hospitalization. For each patient, we generated five graphs weighted by Lagged Linear Coherence (LLC) between signals from distinct Brodmann Areas, covering $\delta$ (2-4 Hz), $\theta$ (4-8 Hz), $\alpha_1$ (8-10.5 Hz), $\alpha_2$ (10.5-13 Hz), and $\beta_1$ (13-20 Hz) frequency bands. To emphasize key neurological connections and maintain sparsity, we applied a sparsification process based on structural and functional brain network properties. We then trained a graph attention model to predict the NIHSS. By examining its attention coefficients, our model reveals insights into brain reconfiguration, providing clinicians with a valuable tool for diagnosis, personalized treatment, and early intervention in neurorehabilitation.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Circuit Discovery for Inner Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many proposed applications of neural networks in machine learning, cognitive/brain science, and society hinge on the feasibility of inner interpretability via circuit discovery. This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries that capture mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-layer perceptrons (part of, e.g., transformers). Our findings reveal a challenging complexity landscape. Many queries are intractable (NP-hard, $\Sigma^p_2$-hard), remain fixed-parameter intractable (W[1]-hard) when constraining model/circuit features (e.g., depth), and are inapproximable under additive, multiplicative, and probabilistic approximation schemes. To navigate this landscape, we prove there exist transformations to tackle some of these hard problems (NP- vs. $\Sigma^p_2$-complete) with better-understood heuristics, and prove the tractability (PTIME) or fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) of more modest queries which retain useful affordances. This framework allows us to understand the scope and limits of interpretability queries, explore viable options, and compare their resource demands among existing and future architectures.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Conformal Isometry Hypothesis for Grid Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for hexagonal periodic patterns in grid cell response maps. The hypothesis posits that grid cell activity forms a high-dimensional vector in neural space, encoding the agent's position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves, this vector rotates within a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal hypothesis suggests that this neural manifold is a conformally isometric embedding of physical space, where local displacements in neural space are proportional to those in physical space. In this paper, we conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagon periodic patterns of grid cells, agnostic to the choice of transformation models. Furthermore, we present a theoretical understanding that hexagon patterns emerge by minimizing our loss function because hexagon flat torus exhibits minimal deviation from local conformal isometry. In addition, we propose a conformal modulation of the agent's input velocity, enabling the recurrent neural network of grid cells to satisfy the conformal isometry hypothesis automatically.</description>
