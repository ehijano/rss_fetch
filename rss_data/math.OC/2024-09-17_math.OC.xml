      <title>Underapproximating Safe Domains of Attraction for Discrete-Time Systems Using Implicit Representations of Backward Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing and certifying stability and attractivity of nonlinear systems is a topic of research interest that has been extensively investigated by control theorists and engineers for many years. Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where available estimation approaches are either conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose an iterative approach to accurately underapproximate safe (i.e., state-constrained) domains of attraction for general discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. Our approach relies on implicit representations of safe backward reachable sets of safe regions of attraction, where such regions can be be easily constructed using, e.g., quadratic Lyapunov functions. The iterations of our approach are monotonic (in the sense of set inclusion), where each iteration results in a safe region of attraction, given as a sublevel set, that underapproximates the safe domain of attraction. The sublevel set representations of the resulting regions of attraction can be efficiently utilized in verifying the inclusion of given points of interest in the safe domain of attraction. We illustrate our approach through two numerical examples, involving two- and four-dimensional nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-Oriented Control Using Gradient Descent: An Unconventional Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel gradient descent-based approach for optimizing control systems, leveraging a new representation of stable closed-loop dynamics as a function of two matrices i.e.   the step size or direction matrix and value matrix of the Lyapunov cost function. This formulation provides a new framework for analyzing and designing feedback control laws. We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</description>

      <title>Proximal Gradient Dynamics: Monotonicity, Exponential Convergence, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the proximal gradient dynamics. This recently-proposed continuous-time dynamics solves optimization problems whose cost functions are separable into a nonsmooth convex and a smooth component. First, we show that the cost function decreases monotonically along the trajectories of the proximal gradient dynamics. We then introduce a new condition that guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function to its optimal value, and show that this condition implies the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. We also show that the proximal Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition guarantees exponential convergence of the cost function. Moreover, we extend these results to time-varying optimization problems, providing bounds for equilibrium tracking. Finally, we discuss applications of these findings, including the LASSO problem, quadratic optimization with polytopic constraints, and certain matrix based problems.</description>

      <title>Realistic Extreme Behavior Generation for Improved AV Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a framework to diagnose the strengths and shortcomings of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) collision avoidance technology with synthetic yet realistic potential collision scenarios adapted from real-world, collision-free data. Our framework generates counterfactual collisions with diverse crash properties, e.g., crash angle and velocity, between an adversary and a target vehicle by adding perturbations to the adversary's predicted trajectory from a learned AV behavior model. Our main contribution is to ground these adversarial perturbations in realistic behavior as defined through the lens of data-alignment in the behavior model's parameter space. Then, we cluster these synthetic counterfactuals to identify plausible and representative collision scenarios to form the basis of a test suite for downstream AV system evaluation. We demonstrate our framework using two state-of-the-art behavior prediction models as sources of realistic adversarial perturbations, and show that our scenario clustering evokes interpretable failure modes from a baseline AV policy under evaluation.</description>

      <title>Uniform Ergodicity and Ergodic-Risk Constrained Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In stochastic systems, risk-sensitive control balances performance with resilience to less likely events. Although existing methods rely on finite-horizon risk criteria, this paper introduces \textit{limiting-risk criteria} that capture long-term cumulative risks through probabilistic limiting theorems. Extending the Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR) framework, we incorporate constraints on these limiting-risk criteria derived from the asymptotic behavior of cumulative costs, accounting for extreme deviations. Using tailored Functional Central Limit Theorems (FCLT), we demonstrate that the time-correlated terms in the limiting-risk criteria converge under strong ergodicity, and establish conditions for convergence in non-stationary settings while characterizing the distribution and providing explicit formulations for the limiting variance of the risk functional. The FCLT is developed by applying ergodic theory for Markov chains and obtaining \textit{uniform ergodicity} of the controlled process. For quadratic risk functionals on linear dynamics, in addition to internal stability, the uniform ergodicity requires the (possibly heavy-tailed) dynamic noise to have a finite fourth moment. This offers a clear path to quantifying long-term uncertainty. We also propose a primal-dual constrained policy optimization method that optimizes the average performance while ensuring limiting-risk constraints are satisfied. Our framework offers a practical, theoretically guaranteed approach for long-term risk-sensitive control, backed by convergence guarantees and validations through simulations.</description>

      <title>Tight Lower Bounds under Asymmetric High-Order H\"older Smoothness and Uniform Convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide tight lower bounds for the oracle complexity of minimizing high-order H\"older smooth and uniformly convex functions. Specifically, for a function whose $p^{th}$-order derivatives are H\"older continuous with degree $\nu$ and parameter $H$, and that is uniformly convex with degree $q$ and parameter $\sigma$, we focus on two asymmetric cases: (1) $q &gt; p + \nu$, and (2) $q &lt; p+\nu$. Given up to $p^{th}$-order oracle access, we establish worst-case oracle complexities of $\Omega\left( \left( \frac{H}{\sigma}\right)^\frac{2}{3(p+\nu)-2}\left( \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}\right)^\frac{2(q-p-\nu)}{q(3(p+\nu)-2)}\right)$ with a truncated-Gaussian smoothed hard function in the first case and $\Omega\left(\left(\frac{H}{\sigma}\right)^\frac{2}{3(p+\nu)-2}+ \log^2\left(\frac{\sigma^{p+\nu}}{H^q}\right)^\frac{1}{p+\nu-q}\right)$ in the second case, for reaching an $\epsilon$-approximate solution in terms of the optimality gap. Our analysis generalizes previous lower bounds for functions under first- and second-order smoothness as well as those for uniformly convex functions, and furthermore our results match the corresponding upper bounds in the general setting.</description>

      <title>3DIOC: Direct Data-Driven Inverse Optimal Control for LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a direct data-driven inverse optimal control (3DIOC) algorithm for the linear time-invariant (LTI) system who conducts a linear quadratic (LQ) control, where the underlying objective function is learned directly from measured input-output trajectories without system identification. By introducing the Fundamental Lemma, we establish the input-output representation of the LTI system. We accordingly propose a model-free optimality necessary condition for the forward LQ problem to build a connection between the objective function and collected data, with which the inverse optimal control problem is solved. We further improve the algorithm so that it requires a less computation and data. Identifiability condition and perturbation analysis are provided. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency and performance of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Proximal Variable Smoothing for Nonsmooth Minimization Involving Weakly Convex Composite with MIMO Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a proximal variable smoothing algorithm for nonsmooth optimization problem with sum of three functions involving weakly convex composite function. The proposed algorithm is designed as a time-varying forward-backward splitting algorithm with two steps: (i) a time-varying forward step with the gradient of a smoothed surrogate function, designed with the Moreau envelope, of the sum of two functions; (ii) the backward step with a proximity operator of the remaining function. For the proposed algorithm, we present a convergence analysis in terms of a stationary point by using a newly smoothed surrogate stationarity measure. As an application of the target problem, we also present a formulation of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) signal detection with phase-shift keying. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formulation and algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents contraction analysis of continuation method for suboptimal model predictive control. A contraction metric is proposed that reflects hierarchical dynamics inherent in the continuation method and, thus, leads us to a pair of tractable matrix inequalities characterizing contraction of closed-loop system controlled by the continuation method. A numerical example verifies our contraction analysis and demonstrates the tractability of the presented matrix inequalities.</description>

      <title>Relationship between stochastic maximum principle and dynamic programming principle under convex expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between maximum principle (MP) and dynamic programming principle (DPP) for forward-backward control system under consistent convex expectation dominated by G-expectation. Under the smooth assumptions for the value function, we get the relationship between MP and DPP under a reference probability by establishing a useful estimate. If the value function is not smooth, then we obtain the first-order sub-jet and super-jet of the value function at any t. However, the processing method in this case is much more difficult than that when t equals 0.</description>

      <title>Nesterov's method of dichotomy via Order Oracle: The problem of optimizing a two-variable function on a square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenges of black box optimization arise due to imprecise responses and limited output information. This article describes new results on optimizing multivariable functions using an Order Oracle, which provides access only to the order between function values and with some small errors. We obtained convergence rate estimates for the one-dimensional search method (golden ratio method) under the condition of oracle inaccuracy, as well as convergence results for the algorithm on a "square" (also with noise), which outperforms its alternatives. The results obtained are similar to those in problems with oracles providing significantly more information about the optimized function. Additionally, the practical application of the algorithm has been demonstrated in maximizing a preference function, where the parameters are the acidity and sweetness of the drink. This function is expected to be convex or at least quasi-convex.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Nash Equilibrium over Variational Equilibria via Fixed-point Set Expression of Quasi-nonexpansive Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium selection problem in the generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) has recently been studied as an optimization problem, defined over the set of all variational equilibria achievable first through a non-cooperative game among players. However, to make such a selection fairly for all players, we have to rely on an unrealistic assumption, that is, the availability of a reliable center not possible to cause any bias for all players. In this paper, we propose a new equilibrium selection achievable by solving a further GNEP, named the hierarchical Nash equilibrium problem (HNEP), within only the players. The HNEP covers existing optimization-based equilibrium selections as its simplest cases, while the general style of the HNEP can ensure a fair equilibrium selection without assuming any trusted center or randomness. We also propose an iterative algorithm for the HNEP as an application of the hybrid steepest descent method to a variational inequality newly defined over the fixed point set of a quasi-nonexpansive operator. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed equilibrium selection via the HNEP.</description>

      <title>Inexact Riemannian Gradient Descent Method for Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient descent methods are fundamental first-order optimization algorithms in both Euclidean spaces and Riemannian manifolds. However, the exact gradient is not readily available in many scenarios. This paper proposes a novel inexact Riemannian gradient descent algorithm for nonconvex problems, accompanied by a convergence guarantee. In particular, we establish two inexact gradient conditions on Riemannian manifolds for the first time, enabling precise gradient approximations. Our method demonstrates strong convergence results for both gradient sequences and function values. The global convergence with constructive convergence rates for the sequence of iterates is ensured under the Riemannian Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz property. Furthermore, our algorithm encompasses two specific applications: Riemannian sharpness-aware minimization and Riemannian extragradient algorithm, both of which inherit the global convergence properties of the inexact gradient methods. Numerical experiments on low-rank matrix completion and principal component analysis problems validate the efficiency and practical relevance of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For bilinear control systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$ we prove, under an accessibility hypothesis, the existence of a nontrivial compact set $D\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying $\mathcal{O}_t(D)=e^{tR}D$ for all $t&gt;0$, where $R\in\mathbb{R}$ is a fixed constant and $\mathcal{O}_t(D)$ denotes the orbit from $D$ at time $t$. This property generalizes the trajectory of an eigenvector on a linear dynamical system, and merits such a set the name "eigenset".</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Spatio-Temporal Decomposition of Control-Related Sum-of-Squares Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for calculating the Region of Attraction (ROA) of nonlinear dynamical systems, both with and without control. The ROA is determined by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite programs (SDPs) defined on a splitting of the time and state space. Previous works demonstrated that this splitting could significantly enhance approximation accuracy, although the improvement was highly dependent on the ad-hoc selection of split locations. In this work, we eliminate the need for this ad-hoc selection by introducing an optimization-based method that performs the splits through conic differentiation of the underlying semidefinite programming problem. We provide the differentiability conditions for the split ROA problem, prove the absence of a duality gap, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Birth control and turnpike property of Lotka-McKendrick models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate, simultaneously, the null-controllability via the feedback control method and the turnpike property of dynamic systems arising from population dynamics models where the control is localized on the non-local term. These models describe the dynamics of one or several populations with age dependence and spatial structure involving time. By considering control functions localized with respect to the spatial variable at the time \(t\) but active for age \( a=0 \), we prove that the entire population can be steered to zero in any positive time \( T&gt;A \) for any data in \( L^2(\Omega\times(0,A)).\) Regarding turnpike property, we use the results of null-controllability and the Phillips'theorem for stability and we design an appropriate dichotomy transformation, based on solutions of the algebraic Riccati and Lyapunov equations. We give numerical examples to support the analytic results.</description>

      <title>Mixed-integer linear programming approaches for nested $p$-center problems with absolute and relative regret objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the nested $p$-center problem, which is a multi-period variant of the well-known $p$-center problem. The use of the nesting concept allows to obtain solutions, which are consistent over the considered time horizon, i.e., facilities which are opened in a given time period stay open for subsequent time periods. This is important in real-life applications, as closing (and potential later re-opening) of facilities between time periods can be undesirable.
  We consider two different versions of our problem, with the difference being the objective function. The first version considers the sum of the absolute regrets (of nesting) over all time periods, and the second version considers minimizing the maximum relative regret over the time periods.
  We present three mixed-integer programming formulations for the version with absolute regret objective and two formulations for the version with relative regret objective. For all the formulations, we present valid inequalities. Based on the formulations and the valid inequalities, we develop branch-and-bound/branch-and-cut solution algorithms. These algorithms include a preprocessing procedure that exploits the nesting property and also begins heuristics and primal heuristics.
  We conducted a computational study on instances from the literature for the $p$-center problem, which we adapted to our problems. We also analyse the effect of nesting on the solution cost and the number of open facilities.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Analysis of ADMM-based Suboptimal Linear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many practical applications of optimal control are subject to real-time computational constraints. When applying model predictive control (MPC) in these settings, respecting timing constraints is achieved by limiting the number of iterations of the optimization algorithm used to compute control actions at each time step, resulting in so-called suboptimal MPC. This paper proposes a suboptimal MPC scheme based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). With a focus on the linear quadratic regulator problem with state and input constraints, we show how ADMM can be used to split the MPC problem into iterative updates of an unconstrained optimal control problem (with an analytical solution), and a dynamics-free feasibility step. We show that using a warm-start approach combined with enough iterations per time-step, yields an ADMM-based suboptimal MPC scheme which asymptotically stabilizes the system and maintains recursive feasibility.</description>

      <title>Confronting Project Conflicts into Success: a Complex Systems Design Approach to Resolving Stalemates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's complex projects development, stakeholders are often involved too late. There is also in many cases a one-sided technical focus that only focuses on the system's behaviour and does not integrate the individual stakeholder preferences. This locks stakeholders into a 'technical' conflict instead of being able to emerge from it 'socially'. Moreover, stakeholders are often involved a-posteriori in a multi-faceted development process which is untransparent, leading to stalemates or even artefacts that nobody ever wants. There is thus a need for a purely associative and a-priori design-supported approach that integrates both system's reality and stakeholder's interests within a joint agreement and technical framework. The state-of-the-art Preferendus, the computer-aided design engine embedded within the proven Open Design Systems (Odesys) methodology, is a neutral tool in confronting complexity into success. The Preferendus is deployed to co-creatively generate a best-fit-for-common-purpose solution for a number of wind farm related degrees of freedom, project constraints and given a number of stakeholder objective functions. Since, the Preferendus design potential for a stalemate depends strongly on stakeholder interest, importance and trust, in this paper an structured stakeholder judgement approach is introduced to transparently arrive at individual stakeholder weights using a choice-based conjoint analysis (CBCA) method. This method also allows for obtaining an initial estimate for the individual stakeholder preference functions. By modelling disputable exogenous factors as endogenous design parameters, it is also shown for which factors the stalemate problem is indeed both technically and socially (un)solvable, while interests and reality are conjoined.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Induction Heads: Provable Training Dynamics and Feature Learning in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a cornerstone of large language model (LLM) functionality, yet its theoretical foundations remain elusive due to the complexity of transformer architectures. In particular, most existing work only theoretically explains how the attention mechanism facilitates ICL under certain data models. It remains unclear how the other building blocks of the transformer contribute to ICL. To address this question, we study how a two-attention-layer transformer is trained to perform ICL on $n$-gram Markov chain data, where each token in the Markov chain statistically depends on the previous $n$ tokens. We analyze a sophisticated transformer model featuring relative positional embedding, multi-head softmax attention, and a feed-forward layer with normalization. We prove that the gradient flow with respect to a cross-entropy ICL loss converges to a limiting model that performs a generalized version of the induction head mechanism with a learned feature, resulting from the congruous contribution of all the building blocks. In the limiting model, the first attention layer acts as a $\mathit{copier}$, copying past tokens within a given window to each position, and the feed-forward network with normalization acts as a $\mathit{selector}$ that generates a feature vector by only looking at informationally relevant parents from the window. Finally, the second attention layer is a $\mathit{classifier}$ that compares these features with the feature at the output position, and uses the resulting similarity scores to generate the desired output. Our theory is further validated by experiments.</description>

      <title>A Tie-breaking based Local Search Algorithm for Stable Matching Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stable marriage problem with incomplete lists and ties (SMTI) and the hospitals/residents problem with ties (HRT) are important in matching theory with broad practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a tie-breaking based local search algorithm (TBLS) designed to achieve a weakly stable matching of maximum size for both the SMTI and HRT problems. TBLS begins by arbitrarily resolving all ties and iteratively refines the tie-breaking strategy by adjusting the relative order within ties based on preference ranks and the current stable matching. Additionally, we introduce TBLS-E, an equity-focused variant of TBLS, specifically designed for the SMTI problem. This variant maintains the objective of maximizing matching size, while enhancing equity through two simple modifications. In comparison with ten other approximation and local search algorithms, TBLS achieves the highest matching size, while TBLS-E exhibits the lowest sex equality cost. Significantly, TBLS-E preserves a matching size comparable to that of TBLS. Both our algorithms demonstrate faster computational speed than other local search algorithms in solving large-sized instances.</description>

      <title>Direct Data-Driven Discounted Infinite Horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator with Robustness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a one-shot learning approach with performance and robustness guarantees for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control of stochastic linear systems. Even though data-based LQR control has been widely considered, existing results suffer either from data hungriness due to the inherently iterative nature of the optimization formulation (e.g., value learning or policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms) or from a lack of robustness guarantees in one-shot non-iterative algorithms. To avoid data hungriness while ensuing robustness guarantees, an adaptive dynamic programming formalization of the LQR is presented that relies on solving a Bellman inequality. The control gain and the value function are directly learned by using a control-oriented approach that characterizes the closed-loop system using data and a decision variable from which the control is obtained. This closed-loop characterization is noise-dependent. The effect of the closed-loop system noise on the Bellman inequality is considered to ensure both robust stability and suboptimal performance despite ignoring the measurement noise. To ensure robust stability, it is shown that this system characterization leads to a closed-loop system with multiplicative and additive noise, enabling the application of distributional robust control techniques. The analysis of the suboptimality gap reveals that robustness can be achieved without the need for regularization or parameter tuning. The simulation results on the active car suspension problem demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of robustness and performance gap compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis for Neumann Optimal Control Problems on Convex Polyhedral Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with finite element error estimates for Neumann boundary control problems posed on convex and polyhedral domains. Different discretization concepts are considered and for each optimal discretization error estimates are established. In particular, for a full discretization with piecewise linear and globally continuous functions for the control and standard linear finite elements for the state optimal convergence rates for the controls are proven which solely depend on the largest interior edge angle. To be more precise, below the critical edge angle of $2\pi/3$, a convergence rate of two (times a log-factor) can be achieved for the discrete controls in the $L^2$-norm on the boundary. For larger interior edge angles the convergence rates are reduced depending on their size, which is due the impact of singular (domain dependent) terms in the solution. The results are comparable to those for the two dimensional case. However, new techniques in this context are used to prove the estimates on the boundary which also extend to the two dimensional case. Moreover, it is shown that the discrete states converge with a rate of two in the $L^2$-norm in the domain independent of the interior edge angles, i.e. for any convex and polyhedral domain. It is remarkable that this not only holds for a full discretization using piecewise linear and globally continuous functions for the control, but also for a full discretization using piecewise constant functions for the control, where the discrete controls only converge with a rate of one in the $L^2$-norm on the boundary at best. At the end, the theoretical results are confirmed by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Infinite-Horizon Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a computationally tractable algorithm for learning infinite-horizon average-reward linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) and linear mixture MDPs under the Bellman optimality condition. While guaranteeing computational efficiency, our algorithm for linear MDPs achieves the best-known regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\mathrm{sp}(v^*)\sqrt{T})$ over $T$ time steps where $\mathrm{sp}(v^*)$ is the span of the optimal bias function $v^*$ and $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping. For linear mixture MDPs, our algorithm attains a regret bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\cdot\mathrm{sp}(v^*)\sqrt{T})$. The algorithm applies novel techniques to control the covering number of the value function class and the span of optimistic estimators of the value function, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for high-performance computing in machine learning and artificial intelligence has led to the development of specialized hardware accelerators like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A key strategy to enhance these accelerators is the reduction of precision in arithmetic operations, which increases processing speed and lowers latency - crucial for real-time AI applications. Precision reduction minimizes memory bandwidth requirements and energy consumption, essential for large-scale and mobile deployments, and increases throughput by enabling more parallel operations per cycle, maximizing hardware resource utilization. This strategy is equally vital for solving NP-hard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems common in machine learning, which often require high precision for accurate representation. Special hardware solvers, such as quantum annealers, benefit significantly from precision reduction. This paper introduces a fully principled Branch-and-Bound algorithm for reducing precision needs in QUBO problems by utilizing dynamic range as a measure of complexity. Experiments validate our algorithm's effectiveness on an actual quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>A Continuous-time Tractable Model for Present-biased Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Present bias, the tendency to overvalue immediate rewards while undervaluing future ones, is a well-known barrier to achieving long-term goals. As artificial intelligence and behavioral economics increasingly focus on this phenomenon, the need for robust mathematical models to predict behavior and guide effective interventions has become crucial. However, existing models are constrained by their reliance on the discreteness of time and limited discount functions. This study introduces a novel continuous-time mathematical model for agents influenced by present bias. Using the variational principle, we model human behavior, where individuals repeatedly act according to a sequence of states that minimize their perceived cost. Our model not only retains analytical tractability but also accommodates various discount functions. Using this model, we consider intervention optimization problems under exponential and hyperbolic discounting and theoretically derive optimal intervention strategies, offering new insights into managing present-biased behavior.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Bures-Wasserstein Barycenters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the large deviations principle for empirical Bures-Wasserstein barycenters of independent, identically-distributed samples of covariance matrices and covariance operators. As an application, we explore some consequences of our results for the phenomenon of dimension-free concentration of measure for Bures-Wasserstein barycenters. Our theory reveals a novel notion of exponential tilting in the Bures-Wasserstein space, which, in analogy with Cr\'amer's theorem in the Euclidean case, solves the relative entropy projection problem under a constraint on the barycenter. Notably, this method of proof is easy to adapt to other geometric settings of interest; with the same method, we obtain large deviations principles for empirical barycenters in Riemannian manifolds and the univariate Wasserstein space, and we obtain large deviations upper bounds for empirical barycenters in the general multivariate Wasserstein space. In fact, our results are the first known large deviations principles for Fr\'echet means in any non-linear metric space.</description>

Abstract: We consider an infinite-horizon optimal control problem with an asymptotic terminal constraint. For the the weakly overtaking criterion and the overtaking criterion, necessary boundary conditions on co-state arcs are deduced, these conditions need no assumptions about the asymptotic behavior of the motion, co-state arc, cost functional, and its derivatives. In the absence of an asymptotic terminal constraint, these boundary conditions with the Pontryagin Maximum Principle allow raising the co-state arcs, corresponding to some asymptotic subdifferentials of the cost functional (fixing the optimal control) at infinity. If this set is a singleton, these conditions coincide with the co-state arc representation proposed by Aseev and Kryazhimskii. These results are illustrated by several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new balancing-based structure-preserving model reduction technique for linear port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems. The proposed method relies on a modification of a set of two dual generalized algebraic Riccati equations that arise in the context of linear quadratic Gaussian balanced truncation for differential algebraic systems. We derive an a priori error bound with respect to a right coprime factorization of the underlying transfer function thereby allowing for an estimate with respect to the gap metric. We further theoretically and numerically analyze the influence of the Hamiltonian and a change thereof, respectively. With regard to this change of the Hamiltonian, we provide a novel procedure that is based on a recently introduced Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov inequality for descriptor systems. Numerical examples demonstrate how the quality of reduced-order models can significantly be improved by first computing an extremal solution to this inequality.</description>

      <title>The law of one price in quadratic hedging and mean-variance portfolio selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The law of one price (LOP) broadly asserts that identical financial flows should command the same price. We show that, when properly formulated, LOP is the minimal condition for a well-defined mean-variance portfolio selection framework without degeneracy. Crucially, the paper identifies a new mechanism through which LOP can fail in a continuous-time $L^2$ setting without frictions, namely 'trading from just before a predictable stopping time', which surprisingly identifies LOP violations even for continuous price processes.
  Closing this loophole allows to give a version of the "Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing" appropriate in the quadratic context, establishing the equivalence of the economic concept of LOP with the probabilistic property of the existence of a local $\scr{E}$-martingale state price density. The latter provides unique prices for all square-integrable claims in an extended market and subsequently plays an important role in quadratic hedging and mean-variance portfolio selection.
  Mathematically, we formulate a novel variant of the uniform boundedness principle for conditionally linear functionals on the $L^0$ module of conditionally square-integrable random variables. We then study the representation of time-consistent families of such functionals in terms of stochastic exponentials of a fixed local martingale.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we design primal and dual bounding methods for multistage adaptive robust optimization (MSARO) problems motivated by two decision rules rooted in the stochastic programming literature. From the primal perspective, this is achieved by applying decision rules that restrict the functional forms of only a certain subset of decision variables resulting in an approximation of MSARO as a two-stage adjustable robust optimization problem. We leverage the two-stage robust optimization literature in the solution of this approximation. From the dual perspective, decision rules are applied to the Lagrangian multipliers of a Lagrangian dual of MSARO, resulting in a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. As the quality of the resulting dual bound depends on the distribution chosen when developing the dual formulation, we define a distribution optimization problem with the aim of optimizing the obtained bound and develop solution methods tailored to the nature of the recourse variables. Our framework is general-purpose and does not require strong assumptions such as a stage-wise independent uncertainty set, and can consider integer recourse variables. Computational experiments on newsvendor, location-transportation, and capital budgeting problems show that our bounds yield considerably smaller optimality gaps compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Exact Two-Step Benders Decomposition for the Time Window Assignment Traveling Salesperson Problem</title>

Abstract: Next-day delivery logistics services are redefining the industry by increasingly focusing on customer service. A challenge each logistics service provider faces is to jointly optimize time window assignment and vehicle routing for such next-day delivery services. To do so in a cost-efficient and customer-centric fashion, real-life uncertainty such as stochastic travel times need to be incorporated in the optimization process. This paper focuses on the canonical optimization problem within this context; the Time Window Assignment Traveling Salesperson Problem with Stochastic Travel Times (TWATSP-ST). It belongs to the class of two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problems with continuous recourse. We introduce Two-Step Benders Decomposition with Scenario Clustering (TBDS) as an exact solution methodology for solving such stochastic programs. The method utilizes a new two-step decomposition along the binary and continuous first-stage decisions and introduces a new scenario-retention strategy that combines and generalizes state-of-the-art Benders approaches and scenario-clustering techniques. Extensive experiments show that TBDS is superior to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. It solves TWATSP-ST instances with up to 25 customers to optimality. It provides better lower and upper bounds that lead to faster convergence than existing state-of-the-art methods. We use TBDS to analyze the structure of the optimal solutions. By increasing routing costs only slightly, customer service can be improved tremendously, driven by smartly alternating between high- and low-variance travel arcs to reduce the impact of delay propagation throughout the executed vehicle route.</description>

      <title>Optimal Potential Shaping on SE(3) via Neural ODEs on Lie Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for the optimization of dynamic systems on finite-dimensional Lie groups. We rephrase dynamic systems as so-called neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs), and formulate the optimization problem on Lie groups. A gradient descent optimization algorithm is presented to tackle the optimization numerically. Our algorithm is scalable, and applicable to any finite dimensional Lie group, including matrix Lie groups. By representing the system at the Lie algebra level, we reduce the computational cost of the gradient computation. In an extensive example, optimal potential energy shaping for control of a rigid body is treated. The optimal control problem is phrased as an optimization of a neural ODE on the Lie group SE(3), and the controller is iteratively optimized. The final controller is validated on a state-regulation task.</description>

Abstract: Decentralized optimization algorithms have recently attracted increasing attention due to its wide applications in all areas of science and engineering. In these algorithms, a collection of agents collaborate to minimize the average of a set of heterogeneous cost functions in a decentralized manner. State-of-the-art decentralized algorithms like Gradient Tracking (GT) and Exact Diffusion (ED) involve communication at each iteration. Yet, communication between agents is often expensive, resource intensive, and can be very slow. To this end, several strategies have been developed to balance between communication overhead and convergence rate of decentralized methods. In this paper, we introduce GT-PGA, which incorporates~GT with periodic global averaging. With the additional PGA, the influence of poor network connectivity in the GT algorithm can be compensated or controlled by a careful selection of the global averaging period. Under the stochastic, nonconvex setup, our analysis quantifies the crucial trade-off between the connectivity of network topology and the PGA period. Thus, with a suitable design of the PGA period, GT-PGA improves the convergence rate of vanilla GT. Numerical experiments are conducted to support our theory, and simulation results reveal that the proposed GT-PGA accelerates practical convergence, especially when the network is sparse.</description>

      <title>Generalized Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sampling-based trajectory optimization method derived from the maximum entropy formulation of Differential Dynamic Programming with Tsallis entropy. This method is a generalization of the legacy work with Shannon entropy, which leads to a Gaussian optimal control policy for exploration during optimization. With the Tsallis entropy, the policy takes the form of $q$-Gaussian, which further encourages exploration with its heavy-tailed shape. Moreover, the sampling variance is scaled according to the value function of the trajectory. This scaling mechanism is the unique property of the algorithm with Tsallis entropy in contrast to the original formulation with Shannon entropy, which scales variance with a fixed temperature parameter. Due to this property, our proposed algorithms can promote exploration when necessary, that is, the cost of the trajectory is high. The simulation results with two robotic systems with multimodal cost demonstrate the properties of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by approximation Bayesian computation using mean-field variational approximation and the computation of equilibrium in multi-species systems with cross-interaction, this paper investigates the composite geodesically convex optimization problem over multiple distributions. The objective functional under consideration is composed of a convex potential energy on a product of Wasserstein spaces and a sum of convex self-interaction and internal energies associated with each distribution. To efficiently solve this problem, we introduce the Wasserstein Proximal Coordinate Gradient (WPCG) algorithms with parallel, sequential, and random update schemes. Under a quadratic growth (QG) condition that is weaker than the usual strong convexity requirement on the objective functional, we show that WPCG converges exponentially fast to the unique global optimum. In the absence of the QG condition, WPCG is still demonstrated to converge to the global optimal solution, albeit at a slower polynomial rate. Numerical results for both motivating examples are consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study decision problems under uncertainty, where the decision-maker has access to $K$ data sources that carry {\em biased} information about the underlying risk factors. The biases are measured by the mismatch between the risk factor distribution and the $K$ data-generating distributions with respect to an optimal transport (OT) distance. In this situation the decision-maker can exploit the information contained in the biased samples by solving a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem, where the ambiguity set is defined as the intersection of $K$ OT neighborhoods, each of which is centered at the empirical distribution on the samples generated by a biased data source. We show that if the decision-maker has a prior belief about the biases, then the out-of-sample performance of the DRO solution can improve with $K$ -- irrespective of the magnitude of the biases. We also show that, under standard convexity assumptions, the proposed DRO problem is computationally tractable if either $K$ or the dimension of the risk factors is kept constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel second-order trajectory optimization algorithm based on Stein Variational Newton's Method and Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming. The proposed algorithm, called Stein Variational Differential Dynamic Programming, is a kernel-based extension of Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming that combines the best of the two worlds of sampling-based and gradient-based optimization. The resulting algorithm avoids known drawbacks of gradient-based dynamic optimization in terms of getting stuck to local minima, while it overcomes limitations of sampling-based stochastic optimization in terms of introducing undesirable stochasticity when applied in online fashion. To test the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, experiments are performed for both trajectory optimization and model predictive control. The experiments include comparisons with unimodal and multimodal Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming as well as Model Predictive Path Integral Control and its multimodal and Stein Variational extensions. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms and confirm the hypothesis that there is a middle ground between sampling and gradient-based optimization that is indeed beneficial for the purposes of dynamic optimization. This middle ground consists of different mechanisms that combine sampling with gradient-based optimization. In this paper, we investigate these different mechanisms and show their benefits in dealing with non-convex dynamic optimization problems found in trajectory optimization and model predictive control.</description>

Abstract: We prove existence of a value for two-player zero-sum stopper vs. singular-controller games on finite-time horizon, when the underlying dynamics is one-dimensional, diffusive and bound to evolve in $[0,\infty)$. We show that the value is the maximal solution of a variational inequality with both obstacle and gradient constraint and satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition at $[0,T)\times\{0\}$. Moreover, we obtain an optimal strategy for the stopper. In order to achieve our goals, we rely on new probabilistic methods, yielding gradient bounds and equi-continuity for the solutions of penalised partial differential equations that approximate the variational inequality.</description>

      <title>Variance-reduced first-order methods for deterministically constrained stochastic nonconvex optimization with strong convergence guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of deterministically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the expected violations of both constraints and first-order stationarity are within a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that the proposed methods achieve a sample complexity and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to develop methods with provable complexity guarantees for finding an approximate stochastic stationary point of such problems that nearly satisfies all constraints with certainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the black-box optimization problem. In this setup, we do not have access to the gradient of the objective function, therefore, we need to estimate it somehow. We propose a new type of approximation JAGUAR, that memorizes information from previous iterations and requires $\mathcal{O}(1)$ oracle calls. We implement this approximation in the Frank-Wolfe and Gradient Descent algorithms and prove the convergence of these methods with different types of zero-order oracle. Our theoretical analysis covers scenarios of non-convex, convex and PL-condition cases. Also in this paper, we consider the stochastic minimization problem on the set $Q$ with noise in the zero-order oracle; this setup is quite unpopular in the literature, but we prove that the JAGUAR approximation is robust not only in deterministic minimization problems, but also in the stochastic case. We perform experiments to compare our gradient estimator with those already known in the literature and confirm the dominance of our methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Branching of Linear and Semidefinite Relaxations for Neural Network Robustness Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.09306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study certifying the robustness of ReLU neural networks against adversarial input perturbations. To diminish the relaxation error suffered by the popular linear programming (LP) and semidefinite programming (SDP) certification methods, we take a branch-and-bound approach to propose partitioning the input uncertainty set and solving the relaxations on each part separately. We show that this approach reduces relaxation error, and that the error is eliminated entirely upon performing an LP relaxation with a partition intelligently designed to exploit the nature of the ReLU activations. To scale this approach to large networks, we consider using a coarser partition whereby the number of parts in the partition is reduced. We prove that computing such a coarse partition that directly minimizes the LP relaxation error is NP-hard. By instead minimizing the worst-case LP relaxation error, we develop a closed-form branching scheme in the single-hidden layer case. We extend the analysis to the SDP, where the feasible set geometry is exploited to design a branching scheme that minimizes the worst-case SDP relaxation error. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Wisconsin breast cancer diagnosis classifiers demonstrate significant increases in the percentages of test samples certified. By independently increasing the input size and the number of layers, we empirically illustrate under which regimes the branched LP and branched SDP are best applied. Finally, we extend our LP branching method into a multi-layer branching heuristic, which attains comparable performance to prior state-of-the-art heuristics on large-scale, deep neural network certification benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Contractive Stochastic Approximation: Additive and Multiplicative Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish maximal concentration bounds for the iterates generated by a stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm under a contractive operator with respect to some arbitrary norm (for example, the $\ell_\infty$-norm). We consider two settings where the iterates are potentially unbounded: SA with bounded multiplicative noise and SA with sub-Gaussian additive noise. Our maximal concentration inequalities state that the convergence error has a sub-Gaussian tail in the additive noise setting and a Weibull tail (which is faster than polynomial decay but could be slower than exponential decay) in the multiplicative noise setting. In addition, we provide an impossibility result showing that it is generally impossible to have sub-exponential tails under multiplicative noise. To establish the maximal concentration bounds, we develop a novel bootstrapping argument that involves bounding the moment-generating function of a modified version of the generalized Moreau envelope of the convergence error and constructing an exponential supermartingale to enable using Ville's maximal inequality. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical results in the context of linear SA and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In economic studies and popular media, interest rates are routinely cited as a major factor behind commodity price fluctuations. At the same time, the transmission channels are far from transparent, leading to long-running debates on the sign and magnitude of interest rate effects. Purely empirical studies struggle to address these issues because of the complex interactions between interest rates, prices, supply changes, and aggregate demand. To move this debate to a solid footing, we extend the competitive storage model to include stochastically evolving interest rates. We establish general conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions and provide a systematic theoretical and quantitative analysis of the interactions between interest rates and prices.</description>

We use this framework to establish an unconditional lower bound against the semidefinite programming + linear equations model, by showing that the relaxation does not solve the approximate graph homomorphism problem and thus, in particular, the approximate graph colouring problem.</description>

      <title>Approximation of sea surface velocity field by fitting surrogate two-dimensional flow to scattered measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12746v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a rapid approximation method is introduced to estimate the sea surface velocity field based on scattered measurements. The method uses a simplified two-dimensional flow model as a surrogate model, which mimics the real submesoscale flow. The proposed approach treats the interpolation of the flow velocities as an optimization problem, aiming to fit the flow model to the scattered measurements. To ensure consistency between the simulated velocity field and the measured values, the boundary conditions in the numerical simulations are adjusted during the optimization process. Additionally, the relevance of quantity and quality of the scattered measurements is assessed, emphasizing the importance of the measurement locations within the domain as well as explaining how these measurements contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the sea surface velocity field approximation. The proposed methodology has been successfully tested in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, leveraging measurements obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) drifters and high-frequency (HF) radar systems. The adaptability of this approach for different domains, measurement types, and conditions implies that it is suitable for real-world submesoscale scenarios where only an approximation of the sea surface velocity field is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for classical capillarity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider capillarity functionals which measure the perimeter of sets contained in a Euclidean half-space assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1,1)$ to the portion of the boundary that touches the boundary of the half-space. Depending on $\lambda$, sets that minimize this capillarity perimeter among those with fixed volume are known to be suitable truncated balls lying on the boundary of the half-space.
  We first give a new proof based on an ABP-type technique of the sharp isoperimetric inequality for this class of capillarity problems. Next we prove two quantitative versions of the inequality: a first sharp inequality estimates the Fraenkel asymmetry of a competitor with respect to the optimal bubbles in terms of the energy deficit; a second inequality estimates a notion of asymmetry for the part of the boundary of a competitor that touches the boundary of the half-space in terms of the energy deficit.
  After a symmetrization procedure, the quantitative inequalities follow from a novel combination of a quantitative ABP method with a selection-type argument.</description>

      <title>A Decentralized Market Mechanism for Energy Communities under Operating Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an operating envelopes (OEs) aware energy community market mechanism that dynamically charges/rewards its members based on two-part pricing. The OEs are imposed exogenously by a regulated distribution system operator (DSO) on the energy community's revenue meter and is subject to a generalized net energy metering (NEM) tariff design. By formulating the interaction of the community operator and its members as a Stackelberg game, we show that the proposed two-part pricing achieves a Nash equilibrium and maximizes the community's social welfare in a decentralized fashion while ensuring that the community's operation abides by the OEs. The market mechanism conforms with the cost-causation principle and guarantees community members a surplus level no less than their maximum surplus when they autonomously face the DSO. The dynamic and uniform community price is a monotonically decreasing function of the community's aggregate renewable generation. We also analyze the impact of exogenous parameters such as NEM rates and OEs on the value of joining the community. Lastly, through numerical studies, we showcase the community's welfare, and pricing, and compare its members' surplus to customers under the DSO's regime.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models to the Rescue: Deadlock Resolution in Connected Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connected multi-agent robotic systems (MRS) are prone to deadlocks in an obstacle environment where the robots can get stuck away from their desired locations under a smooth low-level control policy. Without an external intervention, often in terms of a high-level command, a low-level control policy cannot resolve such deadlocks. Utilizing the generalizability and low data requirements of foundation models, this paper explores the possibility of using text-based models, i.e., large language models (LLMs), and text-and-image-based models, i.e., vision-language models (VLMs), as high-level planners for deadlock resolution. We propose a hierarchical control framework where a foundation model-based high-level planner helps to resolve deadlocks by assigning a leader to the MRS along with a set of waypoints for the MRS leader. Then, a low-level distributed control policy based on graph neural networks is executed to safely follow these waypoints, thereby evading the deadlock. We conduct extensive experiments on various MRS environments using the best available pre-trained LLMs and VLMs. We compare their performance with a graph-based planner in terms of effectiveness in helping the MRS reach their target locations and computational time. Our results illustrate that, compared to grid-based planners, the foundation models perform better in terms of the goal-reaching rate and computational time for complex environments, which helps us conclude that foundation models can assist MRS operating in complex obstacle-cluttered environments to resolve deadlocks efficiently.</description>

      <title>A rate-distortion framework for MCMC algorithms: geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework rooted in a rate distortion problem for Markov chains, and show how a suite of commonly used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are specific instances within it, where the target stationary distribution is controlled by the distortion function. Our approach offers a unified variational view on the optimality of algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings, Glauber dynamics, the swapping algorithm and Feynman-Kac path models. Along the way, we analyze factorizability and geometry of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to a particular divergence. This perspective yields Han--Shearer type inequalities for Markov chains as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. Finally, to demonstrate the significance of our framework, we propose a new projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm that provably accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space.</description>

      <title>Interpretable global minima of deep ReLU neural networks on sequentially separable data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct zero loss neural network classifiers. We write the weight matrices and bias vectors in terms of cumulative parameters, which determine truncation maps acting recursively on input space. The configurations for the training data considered are (i) sufficiently small, well separated clusters corresponding to each class, and (ii) equivalence classes which are sequentially linearly separable. In the best case, for $Q$ classes of data in $\mathbb{R}^M$, global minimizers can be described with $Q(M+2)$ parameters.</description>

      <title>Next-token prediction capacity: general upper bounds and a lower bound for transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens, such as words, the task of next-token prediction is to predict the next-token conditional probability distribution. Decoder-only transformers have become effective models for this task, but their properties are still not fully understood. In particular, the largest number of distinct context sequences that a decoder-only transformer can interpolate next-token distributions for has not been established. To fill this gap, we prove upper and lower bounds on this number, which are equal up to a multiplicative constant. We prove these bounds in the general setting where next-token distributions can be arbitrary as well as the empirical setting where they are calculated from a finite number of document sequences. Our lower bounds are for one-layer multi-head decoder-only transformers and our proofs highlight an important injectivity property satisfied by self-attention. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that the minimal number of parameters for memorization is sufficient for being able to train the model to the entropy lower bound.</description>

      <title>Interpolation with deep neural networks with non-polynomial activations: necessary and sufficient numbers of neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal number of neurons required for a feedforward neural network to interpolate $n$ generic input-output pairs from $\mathbb{R}^d\times \mathbb{R}^{d'}$ is $\Theta(\sqrt{nd'})$. While previous results have shown that $\Theta(\sqrt{nd'})$ neurons are sufficient, they have been limited to sigmoid, Heaviside, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function. Using a different approach, we prove that $\Theta(\sqrt{nd'})$ neurons are sufficient as long as the activation function is real analytic at a point and not a polynomial there. Thus, the only practical activation functions that our result does not apply to are piecewise polynomials. Importantly, this means that activation functions can be freely chosen in a problem-dependent manner without loss of interpolation power.</description>

      <title>Robo-GS: A Physics Consistent Spatial-Temporal Model for Robotic Arm with Hybrid Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real2Sim2Real plays a critical role in robotic arm control and reinforcement learning, yet bridging this gap remains a significant challenge due to the complex physical properties of robots and the objects they manipulate. Existing methods lack a comprehensive solution to accurately reconstruct real-world objects with spatial representations and their associated physics attributes.
  We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms.
  This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment using mesh-based methods.
