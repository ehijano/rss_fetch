      <title>Consistencies of Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type spaces are analysed, and we identify three types of consistency of the players' beliefs in a type space: consistency, universal consistency, and strong consistency. Furthermore, we propose a new interpretation of a type space, defining it as a collection of the players' beliefs.
  This new interpretation introduces a radically different perspective on key theoretic notions, such as the prior, common prior, and posterior. In this framework: the terms of prior, common prior, and posterior are replaced by and interpreted as adequate aggregation of beliefs, consistency of the players' beliefs, and beliefs respectively.
  Through examples, we demonstrate that, under the proposed approach to type spaces, the ex-ante stage is not only meaningless but nonsensical. This is because, strong consistency of the players' beliefs cannot be witnessed by any probability distribution over the state space (i.e., a concrete common prior).</description>

      <title>Checking Cheap Talk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sender--receiver game in which the state is multidimensional and the receiver's action is binary. The sender always prefers the same action. The receiver can select one dimension of the state to verify. Despite the extreme conflict of interest, costless communication can be influential. We identify a class of symmetric equilibria in which the sender's message reveals which dimensions of the state are highest, and the receiver selects one of these dimensions to check. Using this construction, we characterize whether the sender benefits from communication. Similar equilibria exist when the receiver can check multiple dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Impossibility of the Almost Pareto Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new efficiency requirement, a minimal almost weak Pareto principle, which says that x is socially better than y whenever the only one individual never prefers y to x, and all the others prefers x to y. Then, I show that even if the Pareto principle is modified into this harmless form, that seems sufficiently acceptable in the setting of social choice with variable population sizes or incomplete preferences, it violates acyclicity. Furthermore, it is shown that under this framework, a modified Pareto indifference and usual weak Pareto are inconsistent. These results are serious because they have a wide range of applications, not only to population economics and intergenerational equity analysis, but also to welfare evaluations of incomplete preferences and multi-dimensional well-being. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to impose very strong assumptions on various contexts of social choice problems.</description>

      <title>A Class of Practical and Acceptable Social Welfare Orderings That Satisfy the Principles of Aggregation and Non-Aggregation: Reexamination of the Tyrannies of Aggregation and Non-Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits impossibility results on the tyrannies of aggregation and non-aggregation. I propose two aggregation principles (quantitative aggregation and ratio aggregation) and investigate theoretical implications. As a result, I show that quantitative aggregation and minimal non-aggregation are incompatible while ratio aggregation and minimal non-aggregation are compatible under the assumption of standard axioms in social choice theory. Furthermore, this study provides a new characterization of the leximin rule by using replication invariance and the strong version of non-aggregation. Finally, I propose a class of practical and acceptable social welfare orderings that satisfy the principles of aggregation and non-aggregation, which has various advantages over the standard rank-discounted generalized utilitarianism.</description>

      <title>How to Avoid Both the Repugnant and Sadistic Conclusions without Dropping Standard Axioms in Population Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates possibility and impossibility results of the repugnant and sadistic conclusions in population ethics and economics. The repugnant conclusion says that an enormous population with very low well-being is socially better than any smaller population with sufficiently high well-being. The sadistic conclusion says that adding individuals with negative well-being to a society is socially better than adding individuals with positive well-being to it. Previous studies have often found it challenging to avoid both undesirable conclusions. However, I demonstrate that a class of acceptable social welfare orderings can easily prevent these conclusions while adhering to standard axioms, such as anonymity, strong Pareto, Pigou-Dalton transfer, and extended continuity. Nevertheless, if the avoidance requirements for the repugnant and sadistic conclusions are strengthened, it is possible to encounter new impossibility results. These results reveal essential conflicts between the independence axiom and the avoidance of the weak repugnant conclusion when evaluating well-being profiles with different populations.</description>

      <title>Two halves don't make a whole: instability and idleness emerging from the co-evolution of the production and innovation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a disaggregated representation of production using an agent-based fund-flow model that emphasizes inefficiencies, such as factor idleness and production instability, and allows us to explore their emergence through simulations. The model incorporates productivity dynamics (learning and depreciation) and is extended with time-saving process innovations. Specifically, we assume workers possess inherent creativity that flourishes during idle periods. The firm, rather than laying off idle workers, is assumed to harness this potential by involving them in the innovation process. Results show that a firm's organizational and managerial decisions, the temporal structure of the production system, the degree of workers' learning and forgetting, and the pace of innovation are critical factors influencing production efficiency in both the short and long term. The coevolution of production and innovation processes emerges in our model through the two-sided effects of idleness: the loss of skills through forgetting and the deflection of time from the production of goods to the production of ideas giving birth to idleness-driven innovations. In doing so, it allows us to question the status of labour as an adjustment variable in a productive organisation. The paper concludes by discussing potential solutions to this issue and suggesting avenues for future research.</description>
