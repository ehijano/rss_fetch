      <title>Predictive Controlled Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to algorithmic composition, called predictive controlled music (PCM), which combines model predictive control (MPC) with music generation. PCM uses dynamic models to predict and optimize the music generation process, where musical notes are computed in a manner similar to an MPC problem by optimizing a performance measure. A feedforward neural network-based assessment function is used to evaluate the generated musical score, which serves as the objective function of the PCM optimization problem. Furthermore, a recurrent neural network model is employed to capture the relationships among the variables in the musical notes, and this model is then used to define the constraints in the PCM. Similar to MPC, the proposed PCM computes musical notes in a receding-horizon manner, leading to feedback controlled prediction. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the PCM generation method.</description>

      <title>From Imitation to Innovation: The Divergent Paths of Techno in Germany and the USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many documentaries on early house and techno music exist. Here, protagonists from the scenes describe key elements and events that affected the evolution of the music. In the research community, there is consensus that such descriptions have to be examined critically. Yet, there have not been attempts to validate such statements on the basis of audio analyses. In this study, over 9,000 early house and techno tracks from Germany and the United States of America are analyzed using recording studio features, machine learning and inferential statistics. Three observations can be made: 1.) German and US house/techno music are distinct, 2.) US styles are much more alike, and 3.) scarcely evolved over time compared to German house/techno regarding the recording studio features. These findings are in agreement with documented statements and thus provide an audio-based perspective on why techno became a mass phenomenon in Germany but remained a fringe phenomenon in the USA. Observations like these can help the music industry estimate whether new trends will experience a breakthrough or disappear.</description>

      <title>Defense Against Synthetic Speech: Real-Time Detection of RVC Voice Conversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative audio technologies now enable highly realistic voice cloning and real-time voice conversion, increasing the risk of impersonation, fraud, and misinformation in communication channels such as phone and video calls. This study investigates real-time detection of AI-generated speech produced using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC), evaluated on the DEEP-VOICE dataset, which includes authentic and voice-converted speech samples from multiple well-known speakers. To simulate realistic conditions, deepfake generation is applied to isolated vocal components, followed by the reintroduction of background ambiance to suppress trivial artifacts and emphasize conversion-specific cues. We frame detection as a streaming classification task by dividing audio into one-second segments, extracting time-frequency and cepstral features, and training supervised machine learning models to classify each segment as real or voice-converted. The proposed system enables low-latency inference, supporting both segment-level decisions and call-level aggregation. Experimental results show that short-window acoustic features can reliably capture discriminative patterns associated with RVC speech, even in noisy backgrounds. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of practical, real-time deepfake speech detection and underscore the importance of evaluating under realistic audio mixing conditions for robust deployment.</description>

      <title>LEMAS: Large A 150K-Hour Large-scale Extensible Multilingual Audio Suite with Generative Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the LEMAS-Dataset, which, to our knowledge, is currently the largest open-source multilingual speech corpus with word-level timestamps. Covering over 150,000 hours across 10 major languages, LEMAS-Dataset is constructed via a efficient data processing pipeline that ensures high-quality data and annotations. To validate the effectiveness of LEMAS-Dataset across diverse generative paradigms, we train two benchmark models with distinct architectures and task specializations on this dataset. LEMAS-TTS, built upon a non-autoregressive flow-matching framework, leverages the dataset's massive scale and linguistic diversity to achieve robust zero-shot multilingual synthesis. Our proposed accent-adversarial training and CTC loss mitigate cross-lingual accent issues, enhancing synthesis stability. Complementarily, LEMAS-Edit employs an autoregressive decoder-only architecture that formulates speech editing as a masked token infilling task. By exploiting precise word-level alignments to construct training masks and adopting adaptive decoding strategies, it achieves seamless, smooth-boundary speech editing with natural transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on LEMAS-Dataset deliver high-quality synthesis and editing performance, confirming the dataset's quality. We envision that this richly timestamp-annotated, fine-grained multilingual corpus will drive future advances in prompt-based speech generation systems.</description>

      <title>SmoothSync: Dual-Stream Diffusion Transformers for Jitter-Robust Beat-Synchronized Gesture Generation from Quantized Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is a critical area of research aimed at synthesizing speech-synchronized human-like gestures. Existing methods often suffer from issues such as rhythmic inconsistency, motion jitter, foot sliding and limited multi-sampling diversity. In this paper, we present SmoothSync, a novel framework that leverages quantized audio tokens in a novel dual-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to synthesis holistic gestures and enhance sampling variation. Specifically, we (1) fuse audio-motion features via complementary transformer streams to achieve superior synchronization, (2) introduce a jitter-suppression loss to improve temporal smoothness, (3) implement probabilistic audio quantization to generate distinct gesture sequences from identical inputs. To reliably evaluate beat synchronization under jitter, we introduce Smooth-BC, a robust variant of the beat consistency metric less sensitive to motion noise. Comprehensive experiments on the BEAT2 and SHOW datasets demonstrate SmoothSync's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by -30.6% FGD, 10.3% Smooth-BC, and 8.4% Diversity on BEAT2, while reducing jitter and foot sliding by -62.9% and -17.1% respectively. The code will be released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Summary of The Inaugural Music Source Restoration Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music Source Restoration (MSR) aims to recover original, unprocessed instrument stems from professionally mixed and degraded audio, requiring the reversal of both production effects and real-world degradations. We present the inaugural MSR Challenge, which features objective evaluation on studio-produced mixtures using Multi-Mel-SNR, Zimtohrli, and FAD-CLAP, alongside subjective evaluation on real-world degraded recordings. Five teams participated in the challenge. The winning system achieved 4.46 dB Multi-Mel-SNR and 3.47 MOS-Overall, corresponding to relative improvements of 91% and 18% over the second-place system, respectively. Per-stem analysis reveals substantial variation in restoration difficulty across instruments, with bass averaging 4.59 dB across all teams, while percussion averages only 0.29 dB. The dataset, evaluation protocols, and baselines are available at https://msrchallenge.com/.</description>

      <title>When Tone and Words Disagree: Towards Robust Speech Emotion Recognition under Acoustic-Semantic Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems often assume congruence between vocal emotion and lexical semantics. However, in real-world interactions, acoustic-semantic conflict is common yet overlooked, where the emotion conveyed by tone contradicts the literal meaning of spoken words. We show that state-of-the-art SER models, including ASR-based, self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches and Audio Language Models (ALMs), suffer performance degradation under such conflicts due to semantic bias or entangled acoustic-semantic representations. To address this, we propose the Fusion Acoustic-Semantic (FAS) framework, which explicitly disentangles acoustic and semantic pathways and bridges them through a lightweight, query-based attention module. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the Conflict in Acoustic-Semantic Emotion (CASE), the first dataset dominated by clear and interpretable acoustic-semantic conflicts in varied scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAS consistently outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and zero-shot settings. Notably, on the CASE benchmark, conventional SER models fail dramatically, while FAS sets a new SOTA with 59.38% accuracy. Our code and datasets is available at https://github.com/24DavidHuang/FAS.</description>

      <title>FlexiVoice: Enabling Flexible Style Control in Zero-Shot TTS with Natural Language Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes FlexiVoice, a text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system capable of flexible style control with zero-shot voice cloning. The speaking style is controlled by a natural-language instruction and the voice timbre is provided by a speech reference in zero-shot manner. FlexiVoice is built with an LLM core, which takes text as input, and also takes an optional natural language instruction and an optional speech reference to control style and timbre, respectively. FlexiVoice is equipped with a novel Progressive Post-Training (PPT) scheme that progressively unlocks accurate and flexible controllability. In particular, it first employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enable FlexiVoice to accurately follow both natural language instruction and speech reference simultaneously. It then uses a multi-objective Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to disentangle style instruction, reference timbre, and textual content. Finally, it adapts instruction GRPO for more advanced instruction following. Experimental results show that FlexiVoice surpasses competing baselines and demonstrates strong capability in decoupling control factors. Human evaluations further confirm its naturalness, controllability, and robustness. Audio samples are available at https://flexi-voice.github.io.</description>

      <title>LAMB: LLM-based Audio Captioning with Modality Gap Bridging via Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning aims to describe the semantic content of input audio. Recent works have employed large language models (LLMs) as a text decoder to leverage their reasoning capabilities. However, prior approaches that project audio features into the LLM embedding space without considering cross-modal alignment fail to fully utilize these capabilities. To address this, we propose LAMB, an LLM-based audio captioning framework that bridges the modality gap between audio embeddings and the LLM text embedding space. LAMB incorporates a Cross-Modal Aligner that minimizes Cauchy-Schwarz divergence while maximizing mutual information, yielding tighter alignment between audio and text at both global and token levels. We further design a Two-Stream Adapter that extracts semantically enriched audio embeddings, thereby delivering richer information to the Cross-Modal Aligner. Finally, leveraging the aligned audio embeddings, a proposed Token Guide directly computes scores within the LLM text embedding space to steer the output logits of generated captions. Experimental results confirm that our framework strengthens the reasoning capabilities of the LLM decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AudioCaps.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Diseased Detection from Speech Dialogues with Multi-Level Data Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting medical conditions from speech acoustics is fundamentally a weakly-supervised learning problem: a single, often noisy, session-level label must be linked to nuanced patterns within a long, complex audio recording. This task is further hampered by severe data scarcity and the subjective nature of clinical annotations. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a viable path to leverage unlabeled data, existing audio methods often fail to address the core challenge that pathological traits are not uniformly expressed in a patient's speech. We propose a novel, audio-only SSL framework that explicitly models this hierarchy by jointly learning from frame-level, segment-level, and session-level representations within unsegmented clinical dialogues. Our end-to-end approach dynamically aggregates these multi-granularity features and generates high-quality pseudo-labels to efficiently utilize unlabeled data. Extensive experiments show the framework is model-agnostic, robust across languages and conditions, and highly data-efficient-achieving, for instance, 90\% of fully-supervised performance using only 11 labeled samples. This work provides a principled approach to learning from weak, far-end supervision in medical speech analysis.</description>

      <title>ChronosAudio: A Comprehensive Long-Audio Benchmark for Evaluating Audio-Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have witnessed substantial advancements, their long audio understanding capabilities remain unexplored. A plethora of benchmarks have been proposed for general audio tasks, they predominantly focus on short-form clips, leaving without a consensus on evaluating ALLMs over extended durations. This paper proposes ChronosAudio, the first multi-task benchmark tailored for long-audio understanding in ALLMs. It encompasses six major task categories and comprises 36,000 test instances totaling over 200 hours audio, stratified into short, middle, and long-form categories to comprehensively evaluate length generalization. Extensive experiments on 16 state-of-the-art models using ChronosAudio yield three critical findings: 1.Precipitous Long-Context Collapse: ALLMs exhibit a severe inability to sustain performance, with the transition from short to long contexts triggering a staggering performance degradation of over 90% in specific tasks. 2.Structural Attention Dilution: Performance degradation stems from a fundamental failure in maintaining temporal locality; attention mechanisms suffer from significant diffusion in later sequences. 3.Restorative Ceiling of Mitigation: Current strategies only offer 50% recovery. These findings reveal significant challenges in long-audio, underscoring the urgent need for approaches to achieve robust, document-level audio reasoning.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Prediction Entropy for Automatic Prompt Weighting in Zero-Shot Audio-Language Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-language models have recently demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities by leveraging natural-language supervision to classify audio events without labeled training data. Yet, their performance is highly sensitive to the wording of text prompts, with small variations leading to large fluctuations in accuracy. Prior work has mitigated this issue through prompt learning or prompt ensembling. However, these strategies either require annotated data or fail to account for the fact that some prompts may negatively impact performance. In this work, we present an entropy-guided prompt weighting approach that aims to find a robust combination of prompt contributions to maximize prediction confidence. To this end, we formulate a tailored objective function that minimizes prediction entropy to yield new prompt weights, utilizing low-entropy as a proxy for high confidence. Our approach can be applied to individual samples or a batch of audio samples, requiring no additional labels and incurring negligible computational overhead. Experiments on five audio classification datasets covering environmental, urban, and vocal sounds, demonstrate consistent gains compared to classical prompt ensembling methods in a zero-shot setting, with accuracy improvements 5-times larger across the whole benchmark.</description>

      <title>Latent-Level Enhancement with Flow Matching for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been commonly addressed by applying speech enhancement (SE) at the waveform level before recognition. However, speech-level enhancement does not always translate into consistent recognition improvements due to residual distortions and mismatches with the latent space of the ASR encoder. In this letter, we introduce a complementary strategy termed latent-level enhancement, where distorted representations are refined during ASR inference. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Flow Matching Refinement module (FM-Refiner) that operates on the output latents of a pretrained CTC-based ASR encoder. Trained to map imperfect latents-either directly from noisy inputs or from enhanced-but-imperfect speech-toward their clean counterparts, the FM-Refiner is applied only at inference, without fine-tuning ASR parameters. Experiments show that FM-Refiner consistently reduces word error rate, both when directly applied to noisy inputs and when combined with conventional SE front-ends. These results demonstrate that latent-level refinement via flow matching provides a lightweight and effective complement to existing SE approaches for robust ASR.</description>

      <title>WESR: Scaling and Evaluating Word-level Event-Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech conveys not only linguistic information but also rich non-verbal vocal events such as laughing and crying. While semantic transcription is well-studied, the precise localization of non-verbal events remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Current methods suffer from insufficient task definitions with limited category coverage and ambiguous temporal granularity. They also lack standardized evaluation frameworks, hindering the development of downstream applications. To bridge this gap, we first develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, with a new categorization into discrete (standalone) versus continuous (mixed with speech) types. Based on the refined taxonomy, we introduce WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated evaluation set (900+ utterances) with a novel position-aware protocol that disentangles ASR errors from event detection, enabling precise localization measurement for both discrete and continuous events. We also build a strong baseline by constructing a 1,700+ hour corpus, and train specialized models, surpassing both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while preserving ASR quality. We anticipate that WESR will serve as a foundational resource for future research in modeling rich, real-world auditory scenes.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN): A Quantum Information Theoretic Framework for Modeling Musical Context and Polyphony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) summarize musical context into a deterministic hidden state vector, imposing an information bottleneck that fails to capture the inherent ambiguity in music. We propose the Density Matrix RNN (DM-RNN), a novel theoretical architecture utilizing the Density Matrix. This allows the model to maintain a statistical ensemble of musical interpretations (a mixed state), capturing both classical probabilities and quantum coherences. We rigorously define the temporal dynamics using Quantum Channels (CPTP maps). Crucially, we detail a parameterization strategy based on the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, ensuring the learned dynamics remain physically valid (CPTP) by construction. We introduce an analytical framework using Von Neumann Entropy to quantify musical uncertainty and Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) to measure entanglement between voices. The DM-RNN provides a mathematically rigorous framework for modeling complex, ambiguous musical structures.</description>

      <title>LLMs-Integrated Automatic Hate Speech Recognition Using Controllable Text Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for hate speech using large language models (LLMs). The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines. We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based Optimisation of Modulation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulation effects such as phasers, flangers and chorus effects are heavily used in conjunction with the electric guitar. Machine learning based emulation of analog modulation units has been investigated in recent years, but most methods have either been limited to one class of effect or suffer from a high computational cost or latency compared to canonical digital implementations. Here, we build on previous work and present a framework for modelling flanger, chorus and phaser effects based on differentiable digital signal processing. The model is trained in the time-frequency domain, but at inference operates in the time-domain, requiring zero latency. We investigate the challenges associated with gradient-based optimisation of such effects, and show that low-frequency weighting of loss functions avoids convergence to local minima when learning delay times. We show that when trained against analog effects units, sound output from the model is in some cases perceptually indistinguishable from the reference, but challenges still remain for effects with long delay times and feedback.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spoken Language Model with Injected Emotional-Attribution Thinking for Human-like Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified spoken language model for emotional intelligence, enhanced by a novel data construction strategy termed Injected Emotional-Attribution Thinking (IEAT). IEAT incorporates user emotional states and their underlying causes into the model's internal reasoning process, enabling emotion-aware reasoning to be internalized rather than treated as explicit supervision. The model is trained with a two-stage progressive strategy. The first stage performs speech-text alignment and emotional attribute modeling via self-distillation, while the second stage conducts end-to-end cross-modal joint optimization to ensure consistency between textual and spoken emotional expressions. Experiments on the Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge (HumDial) Emotional Intelligence benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves top-ranked performance across emotional trajectory modeling, emotional reasoning, and empathetic response generation under both LLM-based and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>VCB Bench: An Evaluation Benchmark for Audio-Grounded Large Language Model Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have greatly enhanced multimodal conversational systems. However, existing benchmarks remain limited -- they are mainly English-centric, rely on synthetic speech, and lack comprehensive, discriminative evaluation across multiple dimensions. To address these gaps, we present Voice Chat Bot Bench (VCB Bench) -- a high-quality Chinese benchmark built entirely on real human speech. VCB Bench evaluates LALMs from three complementary perspectives: instruction following (including speech-level control beyond text commands), knowledge understanding (general knowledge, reasoning, and daily dialogue), and robustness (stability under perturbations in content, environment, and speaker traits). Experiments on representative LALMs reveal notable performance gaps and highlight future directions for improvement. VCB Bench provides a reproducible and fine-grained evaluation framework, offering standardized methodology and practical insights for advancing Chinese voice conversational models.</description>

      <title>MOSS Transcribe Diarize: Accurate Transcription with Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MM-Sonate: Multimodal Controllable Audio-Video Generation with Zero-Shot Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint audio-video generation aims to synthesize synchronized multisensory content, yet current unified models struggle with fine-grained acoustic control, particularly for identity-preserving speech. Existing approaches either suffer from temporal misalignment due to cascaded generation or lack the capability to perform zero-shot voice cloning within a joint synthesis framework. In this work, we present MM-Sonate, a multimodal flow-matching framework that unifies controllable audio-video joint generation with zero-shot voice cloning capabilities. Unlike prior works that rely on coarse semantic descriptions, MM-Sonate utilizes a unified instruction-phoneme input to enforce strict linguistic and temporal alignment. To enable zero-shot voice cloning, we introduce a timbre injection mechanism that effectively decouples speaker identity from linguistic content. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of standard classifier-free guidance in multimodal settings, we propose a noise-based negative conditioning strategy that utilizes natural noise priors to significantly enhance acoustic fidelity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MM-Sonate establishes new state-of-the-art performance in joint generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines in lip synchronization and speech intelligibility, while achieving voice cloning fidelity comparable to specialized Text-to-Speech systems.</description>

      <title>MoE Adapter for Large Audio Language Models: Sparsity, Disentanglement, and Gradient-Conflict-Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the input modality of Large Language Models~(LLMs) to the audio domain is essential for achieving comprehensive multimodal perception. However, it is well-known that acoustic information is intrinsically \textit{heterogeneous}, entangling attributes such as speech, music, and environmental context. Existing research is limited to a dense, parameter-shared adapter to model these diverse patterns, which induces \textit{gradient conflict} during optimization, as parameter updates required for distinct attributes contradict each other. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textit{\textbf{MoE-Adapter}}, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture designed to decouple acoustic information. Specifically, it employs a dynamic gating mechanism that routes audio tokens to specialized experts capturing complementary feature subspaces while retaining shared experts for global context, thereby mitigating gradient conflicts and enabling fine-grained feature learning. Comprehensive experiments show that the MoE-Adapter achieves superior performance on both audio semantic and paralinguistic tasks, consistently outperforming dense linear baselines with comparable computational costs. Furthermore, we will release the related code and models to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>IndexTTS 2.5 Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In prior work, we introduced IndexTTS 2, a zero-shot neural text-to-speech foundation model comprising two core components: a transformer-based Text-to-Semantic (T2S) module and a non-autoregressive Semantic-to-Mel (S2M) module, which together enable faithful emotion replication and establish the first autoregressive duration-controllable generative paradigm. Building upon this, we present IndexTTS 2.5, which significantly enhances multilingual coverage, inference speed, and overall synthesis quality through four key improvements: 1) Semantic Codec Compression: we reduce the semantic codec frame rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz, halving sequence length and substantially lowering both training and inference costs; 2) Architectural Upgrade: we replace the U-DiT-based backbone of the S2M module with a more efficient Zipformer-based modeling architecture, achieving notable parameter reduction and faster mel-spectrogram generation; 3) Multilingual Extension: We propose three explicit cross-lingual modeling strategies, boundary-aware alignment, token-level concatenation, and instruction-guided generation, establishing practical design principles for zero-shot multilingual emotional TTS that supports Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish, and enables robust emotion transfer even without target-language emotional training data; 4) Reinforcement Learning Optimization: we apply GRPO in post-training of the T2S module, improving pronunciation accuracy and natrualness. Experiments show that IndexTTS 2.5 not only supports broader language coverage but also replicates emotional prosody in unseen languages under the same zero-shot setting. IndexTTS 2.5 achieves a 2.28 times improvement in RTF while maintaining comparable WER and speaker similarity to IndexTTS 2.</description>

      <title>Muse: Towards Reproducible Long-Form Song Generation with Fine-Grained Style Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent commercial systems such as Suno demonstrate strong capabilities in long-form song generation, while academic research remains largely non-reproducible due to the lack of publicly available training data, hindering fair comparison and progress. To this end, we release a fully open-source system for long-form song generation with fine-grained style conditioning, including a licensed synthetic dataset, training and evaluation pipelines, and Muse, an easy-to-deploy song generation model. The dataset consists of 116k fully licensed synthetic songs with automatically generated lyrics and style descriptions paired with audio synthesized by SunoV5. We train Muse via single-stage supervised finetuning of a Qwen-based language model extended with discrete audio tokens using MuCodec, without task-specific losses, auxiliary objectives, or additional architectural components. Our evaluations find that although Muse is trained with a modest data scale and model size, it achieves competitive performance on phoneme error rate, text--music style similarity, and audio aesthetic quality, while enabling controllable segment-level generation across different musical structures. All data, model weights, and training and evaluation pipelines will be publicly released, paving the way for continued progress in controllable long-form song generation research. The project repository is available at https://github.com/yuhui1038/Muse.</description>
