      <title>On Primitive Ulrich Bundles over a few projective varieties with Picard number two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of primitive Ulrich bundle in a smooth projective variety. We motivate this notion and give a cohomological characterization in the case of the degree $6$ flag threefold and rational normal scrolls. Finally we propose a few open problems.</description>

      <title>The contraction morphism between maps and quasimaps to toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $X$ a smooth projective toric variety, we construct a morphism from a closed substack of the moduli space of stable maps to $X$ to the moduli space of quasimaps to $X$. If $X$ is Fano, we show that this morphism is surjective. The construction relies on the notion of degree of a quasimap at a base-point, which we define. We show that a quasimap is determined by its regular extension and the degree of each of its basepoints.</description>

      <title>Heights of complete intersections in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The height of a toric variety and that of its hypersurfaces can be expressed in convex-analytic terms as an adelic sum of mixed integrals of their roof functions and duals of their Ronkin functions.
  Here we extend these results to the $2$-codimensional situation by presenting a limit formula predicting the typical height of the intersection of two hypersurfaces on a toric variety. More precisely, we prove that the height of the intersection cycle of two effective divisors translated by a strict sequence of torsion points converges to an adelic sum of mixed integrals of roof and duals of Ronkin functions.
  This partially confirms a previous conjecture of the authors about the average height of families of complete intersections in toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Resolving plane curves using stack-theoretic blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stack-theoretic blow-ups have proven to be efficient in resolving singularities over fields of characteristic zero. In this article, we move forward towards positive characteristic where new challenges arise. In particular, the dimension of the tangent space of the Artin stack created after a weighted blow-up may increase, which makes it hard to apply inductive arguments -- even if the maximal order decreases. We focus on the case of curve singularities embedded into a smooth surface defined over a perfect field. For this special situation we propose a solution to overcome the inductive challenge through canonically constructed multi-weighted blow-ups.</description>

      <title>On regular surfaces of general type with numerically trivial automorphism group of order $4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a regular minimal surface of general type over the field of complex numbers, and $\mathrm{Aut}_\mathbb{Q}(S)$ the subgroup of automorphisms acting trivially on $H^*(S,\mathbb{Q})$. It has been known since twenty years that $|\mathrm{Aut}_\mathbb{Q}(S)|\leq 4$ if the invariants of $S$ are sufficiently large. Under the assumption that $K_S$ is ample, we characterize the surfaces achieving the equality, showing that they are isogenous to a product of two curves, of unmixed type, and that the group $\mathrm{Aut}_\mathbb{Q}(S)$ is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2$. Moreover, unbounded families of surfaces with $\mathrm{Aut}_\mathbb{Q}(S)\cong(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2$ are provided.</description>

      <title>Unimodular bilinear lattices, automorphism groups, vanishing cycles, monodromy groups, distinguished bases, braid group actions and moduli spaces from upper triangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This monograph starts with an upper triangular matrix with integer entries and 1's on the diagonal. It develops from this a spectrum of structures, which appear in different contexts, in algebraic geometry, representation theory and the theory of irregular meromorphic connections. It provides general tools to study these structures, and it studies sytematically the cases of rank 2 and 3. The rank 3 cases lead already to a rich variety of phenomena and give an idea of the general landscape. The first structure associated to the matrix is a Z-lattice with unimodular bilinear form (called Seifert form) and a triangular basis. It leads immediately to an even and an odd intersection form, reflections and transvections, an even and an odd monodromy group, even and odd vanishing cycles. Braid group actions lead to braid group orbits of distinguished bases and of upper triangular matrices. Finally, complex manifolds, which consist of correctly glued Stokes regions, are associated to these braid group orbits. The last chapter is a report on the case of isolated hypersurface singularities.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of Local Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the geometric special fibers of local models of Shimura varieties and of moduli of $\bG$-Shtukas with parahoric level structure. We investigate two problems with respect to the irreducibility of local models. First, we classify the cases where the local models are irreducible. Next, we show that the fibers of the level-changing map between the geometric special fiber of local models with different parahoric levels are always isomorphic to single (i.e., irreducible) Schubert varieties in the partial flag variety.</description>

      <title>Effective Bounds on Topological Types of Real Algebraic and Semialgebraic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of classifying real algebraic and semialgebraic sets by their topological types, focusing on establishing the effectiveness of bounds rather than deriving new quantitative estimates. Building on Hardt's theorem and leveraging a model-theoretic framework, we prove the existence of effective bounds on the number of distinct topological types for real algebraic sets defined by polynomials of bounded degree. While less precise than previously known doubly exponential bounds derived from methods such as Stratified Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition, our results are obtained with minimal additional work, emphasizing simplicity and uniformity.
  Additionally, we establish the existence of an effective bound on the complexity of the semialgebraic homeomorphisms that describe representatives of the topological equivalence classes, offering a novel perspective on their explicit classification. These findings complement existing results by demonstrating the effectiveness of uniform bounds within a logical and geometric framework. The paper concludes with an extension of these results to semialgebraic sets of bounded complexity, further emphasizing the uniformity of the approach across varying real closed fields.</description>

      <title>Isoresidual curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a partition $\mu$ of $-2$, the stratum $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ parametrizes meromorphic differential one-forms on $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ with~$n$ zeros and $p$ poles of orders prescribed by $\mu$. The isoresidual fibration is defined by assigning to each differential in $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ its configuration of residues at the poles. In the case of differentials with $n=2$ zeros, generic isoresidual fibers are complex curves endowed with a canonical translation structure, which we describe extensively in this paper. Quantitative characteristics of the translation structure on isoresidual fiber curves, including the orders of the singularities and a period central charge encapsulating the linear dependence of periods on the underlying configuration of residues, provide rich discrete invariants for these fibers. We also determine the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves from intersection-theoretic computations, relying on the multi-scale compactification of strata of differentials. In particular, we describe a wall and chamber structure for the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves in terms of the partition $\mu$. Additionally, we classify the connected components of generic isoresidual fibers for strata in genus zero with an arbitrary number of zeros.</description>

      <title>Euclidean distance discriminants and Morse attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study concerns the Euclidean distance function in case of complex plane curves. We decompose the ED discriminant into 3 parts which are responsible for the 3 types of behavior of the Morse points, and we find the structure of each one. In particular we shed light on the ``atypical discriminant'' which is due to the loss of Morse points at infinity.
  We find formulas for the number of Morse singularities which abut to the corresponding 3 types of attractors when moving the centre of the distance function toward a point of the discriminant.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the geometric structure of the locus $\Phi_3 (X)$ of rank $3$ quadratic equations of the Veronese variety $X = \nu_d (\mathbb{P}^n)$. Specifically, we investigate the minimal irreducible decomposition of $\Phi_3 (X)$ of rank $3$ quadratic equations and analyze the geometric properties of the irreducible components of $\Phi_3 (X)$ such as their desingularizations. Additionally, we explore the non-singularity and singularity of these irreducible components of $\Phi_3 (X)$.</description>

      <title>The Fermat curves and arrangements of lines and conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present new results about arrangements of lines and conics associated to the Fermat curves in the projective plane. The first result is that we compute the 2-Hessian to a Fermat curve, which is a union of lines, and we determine the singularities of this line arrangement. Then we consider the sextactic points on the Fermat curves and show that they are distributed on three grids. The lines in the grids constitute new line arrangements associated with the Fermat curves, and we determine the singularities on each of them. The main result is that we compute the hyperosculating conics to the Fermat curves, study the arrangement of these conics, and find that they intersect in a special way.</description>

      <title>On the numerically and cohomologically trivial automorphisms of elliptic surfaces II: $\chi(S)&gt;0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second part we study first the group $Aut_{\mathbb{Q}}(S)$ of numerically trivial automorphisms of a properly elliptic surface $S$, that is, of a minimal surface with Kodaira dimension $\kappa(S)=1$, in the case $\chi(S) \geq 1$. Our first surprising result is that, against what has been believed for over 40 years, we have nontrivial such groups for $p_g(S) &gt;0$. Indeed, we show even that there is no absolute upper bound for their cardinalities $|Aut_{\mathbb{Q}}(S)|$. At any rate, we give explicit and almost sharp upper bounds for $|Aut_{\mathbb{Q}}(S)|$ in terms of the numerical invariants of $S$, as $\chi(S)$, the irregularity $q(S)$, and the bigenus $P_2(S)$. Moreover, we come quite close to a complete description of the possible groups $Aut_{\mathbb{Q}}(S)$, and we give an effective criterion for surfaces to have trivial $Aut_{\mathbb{Q}}(S)$.
  Our second surprising results concern the group $Aut_{\mathbb{Z}}(S)$ of cohomologically trivial automorphisms; we are able to give the explicit upper bounds for $|Aut_{\mathbb{Z}}(S)|$ in special cases: $9$ when $p_g(S) =0$, and the sharp upper bound
  $3$ when $S$ (i.e., the pluricanonical elliptic fibration) is isotrivial.
  We produce also non isotrivial examples where $Aut_{\mathbb{Z}}(S)$ is a cyclic group of order $2$ or $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a first step towards the classification of singular Mori dream $K3$ surfaces. We prove that if the Picard lattice of a singular $K3$ surface is Mori dream, then the surface is Mori dream. Moreover, we show that for singular $K3$ surfaces, of Picard rank two, being Mori dream is equivalent to contain two negative curves intersecting each other, and apply this result to study Mori dreamness of $K3$ surfaces with a singular point of type $A_n$.</description>

      <title>Additive and Multiplicative Coinvariant Spaces of Weyl Groups in the Light of Harmonics and Graded Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite group with an integral representation has two induced canonical actions, one on polynomials and one on Laurent polynomials. Knowledge about the invariants is in either case applied in many computations by means of symmetry reduction techniques, for example in algebraic systems solving or optimization. In this article, we realize the two actions as the additive action on the symmetric algebra and the multiplicative action on the group algebra of a lattice with Weyl group symmetry. By constructing explicit equivariant isomorphisms, we draw algorithmic relations between the two, which allow the transfer and preservation of representation- and invariant-theoretic properties. Our focus lies on the multiplicative coinvariant space, which is identified with the regular representation and harmonic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Super volumes and KdV tau functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of curves are deeply related to the Kontsevich-Witten KdV tau function. They possess a Virasoro symmetry which comes out of recursion relations between the volumes due to Mirzakhani. Similarly, the super Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of super curves with Neveu-Schwarz punctures are related to the Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten (BGW) tau function of the KdV hierarchy and satisfy a recursion due to Stanford and Witten, analogous to Mirzakhani's recursion. In this paper we prove that by also allowing Ramond punctures, the super Weil-Petersson volumes are related to the generalised BGW KdV tau function, which is a one parameter deformation of the BGW tau function. This allows us to prove that these new super volumes also satisfy the Stanford-Witten recursion.</description>

      <title>Lattice 3-polytopes of lattice width 2 and corresponding toric hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kodaira dimension of a nondegenerate toric hypersurface can be computed from the dimension of the Fine interior of its Newton polytope according to recent work of Victor Batyrev, where the Fine interior of the Newton polytope is the subpolytope consisting of all points which have an integral distance of at least $1$ to all integral supporting hyperplanes. In particular, if we have a Fine interior of codimension $1$, then the hypersurface is of general type and the Newton polytope has lattice width $2$. In this article we study this situation for lattice $3$-polytopes and the corresponding surfaces of general type. In particular, we classify all $2$-dimensional Fine interiors of those lattice $3$-polytopes which have at most $40$ interior lattice points, thus obtaining many examples of surfaces of general type and genus at most $40$.</description>

      <title>Donagi-Markman cubics for Hitchin systems of type A2, B2. G2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain explicit formulae for the Donagi-Markman (Bryant-Griffiths, Yukawa) cubic for Hitchin systems of type $A_2$, $B_2$ and $G_2$. This is achieved by evaluating the quadratic residues in the Balduzzi-Pantev formula, using a previous result of ours. For $G_2$ we also recover earlier results of Hitchin.</description>

      <title>Rational quartic curves in the Mukai-Umemura variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be the Fano threefold of index one, degree $22$, and $\mathrm{Pic}(X)\cong\mathbb{Z}$. Such a threefold $X$ can be realized by a regular zero section $\mathbf{s}$ of $(\bigwedge^2\mathcal{F}^{*})^{\oplus 3}$ over Grassmannian variety $\mathrm{Gr}(3,V)$, $\dim V=7$ with the universal subbundle $\mathcal{F}$. When the section $\mathbf{s}$ is given by the net of the $\mathrm{SL}_2$-invariant skew forms, we call it by the Mukai-Umemura (MU) variety. In this paper, we prove that the Hilbert scheme of rational quartic curves in the MU-variety is smooth and compute its Poincar\'e polynomial by applying the Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work brings Mellin transforms into the realm of motivic integration. The new, larger class of motivic functions is stable under motivic Mellin and Fourier transforms, with general Fubini results and change of variables formulas. It specializes to $p$-adic integrals and $p$-adic Mellin transforms uniformly in $p$, with transfer principles between zero and positive characteristic local fields. In particular, it generalizes previous set-ups of motivic integration with Fubini from among others [16, 17, 18, 29, 9] and simplifies some aspects on the way by using the ideas of [10].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modular curves serve as excellent objects for testing conjectures in arithmetic geometry. They possess a natural geometric definition in contrast with rather nontrivial structure. On the other hand, they are well-studied from the perspective of number theory. Furthermore, there is a well-developed and powerful analytic technique available. We will use the square of the modular curve as the experimental object to investigate the arithmetic properties of the periods of mixed Hodge structures. There is an additional reason for this study: this square is naturally associated with a family of (Hecke) curves. These curves form components of the Neron-Severi locus, allowing for the interpretation of the square of the moduli curve as the moduli space of split (i.e., the product of two elliptic curves) abelian surfaces.</description>

  \[x_{k+2}^2 - 2 x_{k+1}^2 + x_k^2 = 2\]
  for $k = 1,2,3$, then they must be consecutive. This answers a question of J.~Richard~B\"{u}chi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the half-form corrected geometric quantization of symplectic toric manifolds with respect to mixed toric polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{\infty}$. These polarizations are obtained at infinite geodesic time along Mabuchi rays of toric K\"ahler polarizations generated by the norm square of the moment map of a torus subgroup.
  The geodesic rays are lifted to the quantum bundle via generalized coherent state transforms (gCST) and define equivariant isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces for the K\"ahler polarizations and the Hilbert space for the mixed polarization.</description>

      <title>Totally positive skew-symmetric matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A matrix is totally positive if all of its minors are positive. This notion of positivity coincides with the type A version of Lusztig's more general total positivity in reductive real-split algebraic groups. Since skew-symmetric matrices always have nonpositive entries, they are not totally positive in the classical sense. The space of skew-symmetric matrices is an affine chart of the orthogonal Grassmannian $\mathrm{OGr}(n,2n)$. Thus, we define a skew-symmetric matrix to be totally positive if it lies in the totally positive orthogonal Grassmannian. We provide a positivity criterion for these matrices in terms of a fixed collection of minors, and show that their Pfaffians have a remarkable sign pattern. The totally positive orthogonal Grassmannian is a CW cell complex and is subdivided into Richardson cells. We introduce a method to determine which cell a given point belongs to in terms of its associated matroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that single $G$-weighted $\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz numbers with internal faces are computed by refined topological recursion on a rational spectral curve, for certain rational weights $G$. Consequently, the $\mathfrak{b}$-Hurwitz generating function analytically continues to a rational curve. In particular, our results cover the cases of $\mathfrak{b}$-monotone Hurwitz numbers, and the enumeration of maps and bipartite maps (with internal faces) on non-oriented surfaces. As an application, we prove that the correlators of the Gaussian, Jacobi and Laguerre $\beta$-ensembles are computed by refined topological recursion.</description>

      <title>Mixed extensions of generic finite games embedded into products of real projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite games in normal form and their mixed extensions are a corner stone of noncooperative game theory. Often generic finite games and their mixed extensions are considered. But the properties which one expects in generic games and the existence of games with these properties are often treated only in passing. The paper considers strong properties and proves that generic games have these properties. The space of mixed strategy combinations is embedded in a natural way into a product of real projective spaces. All relevant hypersurfaces extend to this bigger space. The paper shows that for all games in the complement of a semialgebraic subset of codimension at least one all relevant hypersurfaces in the bigger space are smooth and maximally transversal. The proof uses the theorem of Sard and follows an argument of Khovanskii.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies three different ways to assign weights to the lattice points of a convex polytope and discusses the algebraic and combinatorial properties of the resulting weighted Ehrhart functions and their generating functions and associated rings. These will be called $q$-weighted, $r$-weighted, and $s$-weighted Ehrhart functions, respectively. The key questions we investigate are \emph{When are the weighted Ehrhart series rational functions and which classical Ehrhart theory properties are preserved? And, when are the abstract formal power series the Hilbert series of Ehrhart rings of some polytope?} We prove generalizations about weighted Ehrhart $h^*$-coefficients of $q$-weighted Ehrhart series, and show $q$- and $s$-weighted Ehrhart reciprocity theorems. Then, we show the $q$- and $r$-weighted Ehrhart rings are the (classical) Ehrhart rings of weight lifting polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We answer several fundamental geometric questions about reaction networks with power-law kinetics, on topics such as generic finiteness of steady states, robustness, and nondegenerate multistationarity. In particular, we give an ideal-theoretic characterization of generic absolute concentration robustness, as well as conditions under which a network that admits multiple steady states also has the capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. The key tools underlying our results come from the theory of vertically parametrized systems, and include a linear algebra condition that characterizes when the steady state system has positive nondegenerate zeros.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a theorem of Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze, we develop a stacky approach to crystals and isocrystals on "Frobenius-smooth" schemes over F_p . This class of schemes goes back to Berthelot-Messing and contains all smooth schemes over perfect fields of characteristic p.
  To treat isocrystals, we prove some descent theorems for sheaves of Banachian modules, which could be interesting in their own right.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.03412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$ over a local non-archimedean field $K$ one can mimic the construction from the classical Deligne--Lusztig theory by using the loop space functor. We study this construction in special the case that $G$ is an inner form of ${\rm GL}_n$ and the loop Deligne--Lusztig variety is of Coxeter type. After simplifying the proof of its representability, our main result is that its $\ell$-adic cohomology realizes many irreducible supercuspidal representations of $G$, notably almost all among those whose L-parameter factors through an unramified elliptic maximal torus of $G$. This gives a purely local, purely geometric and -- in a sense -- quite explicit way to realize special cases of the local Langlands and Jacquet--Langlands correspondences.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm solving the following problem: given two  genus 2 curves over a field k with isogenous Jacobians, compute  such an isogeny explicitly.  This isogeny can be either an  l-isogeny or, in the real multiplication case, an isogeny with  cyclic kernel; we require that k have large enough characteristic  and that the curves be sufficiently generic.  Our algorithm uses  modular equations for these isogeny types, and makes essential use  of an explicit Kodaira--Spencer isomorphism in genus 2.</description>

Abstract: For a natural class of cohomology theories with support (including \'etale or pro-\'etale cohomology with suitable coefficients), we prove a moving lemma for cohomology classes with support on smooth quasi-projective k-varieties that admit a smooth projective compactification (e.g. if char(k)=0). This has the following consequences for such k-varieties and cohomology theories: a local and global generalization of the effacement theorem of Quillen, Bloch--Ogus, and Gabber, a finite level version of the Gersten conjecture in characteristic zero, and a generalization of the injectivity property and the codimension 1 purity theorem for \'etale cohomology. Our results imply that the refined unramified cohomology groups from [Sch23] are motivic.</description>

      <title>Singularities of local models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct local models of Shimura varieties and investigate their singularities, with special emphasis on wildly ramified cases. More precisely, with the exception of odd unitary groups in residue characteristic $2$ we construct local models, show reducedness of their special fiber, Cohen$-$Macaulayness and in equi-characteristic also (pseudo-)rationality. In mixed characteristic we conjecture their (pseudo-)rationality. This is based on the construction of parahoric group schemes over two-dimensional bases for wildly ramified groups and an analysis of singularities of the attached Schubert varieties in positive characteristic using perfect geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12807v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a new algebro-geometric perspective on the study of the Milnor fibration and, as a first step toward putting it into practice, prove powerful criteria for a deformation of a holomorphic function germ to admit a stratification on its domain partially satisfying the Thom condition and, more generally, to respect the Milnor fibration of the original germ in an appropriate sense. As corollaries, we obtain a method of partitioning the space of homogeneous polynomials of a fixed degree into finitely many locally closed subsets such that the fiber diffeomorphism type of the Milnor fibration is constant along each subset and a criterion under which deformations of a function with critical locus a complete intersection will be well-behaved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct smooth projective families of algebraic varieties in characteristic $p$ such that the dimensions of the de Rham and Hodge cohomology groups of the fibers can be made to jump by an arbitrarily large amount. To do this, we first construct an example using the classifying stack of a finite flat group scheme which degenerates $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$ to $\alpha_p \oplus \alpha_p$. Along the way, we give a self-contained exposition of the construction of Godeaux--Serre varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider slice filtrations in logarithmic motivic homotopy theory. Our main results establish conjectured compatibilities with the Beilinson, BMS, and HKR filtrations on (topological, log) Hochschild homology and related invariants. In the case of perfect fields admitting resolution of singularities, we show that the slice filtration realizes the BMS filtration on the $p$-completed topological cyclic homology. Furthermore, the motivic trace map is compatible with the slice and BMS filtrations, yielding a natural morphism from the motivic slice spectral sequence to the BMS spectral sequence. Finally, we consider the Kummer \'etale hypersheafification of logarithmic $K$-theory and show that its very effective slices compute Lichtenbaum \'etale motivic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for moduli space of genus two curves and an application to isogeny based cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use machine learning to study the moduli space of genus two curves, specifically focusing on detecting whether a genus two curve has $(n, n)$-split Jacobian. Based on such techniques, we observe that there are very few rational moduli points with small weighted moduli height and $(n, n)$-split Jacobian for $n=2, 3, 5$. We computational prove that there are only 34 genus two curves (resp. 44 curves) with (2,2)-split Jacobians (resp. (3,3)-split Jacobians) and weighted moduli height $\leq 3$.
  We discuss different machine learning models for such applications and demonstrate the ability to detect splitting with high accuracy using only the Igusa invariants of the curve. This shows that artificial neural networks and machine learning techniques can be highly reliable for arithmetic questions in the moduli space of genus two curves and may have potential applications in isogeny-based cryptography.</description>

      <title>Relations in Twisted Quantum K-Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce twisted quantum $K$-rings, defined via twisted $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants. We develop a toolkit for computing relations by adapting some results about ordinary quantum K rings to our setting, and discuss some applications, including Ruan-Zhang's quantum $K$-theory with level structure, and complete intersections inside projective space, confirming some predictions coming from physics.
  In addition, we formulate a ring-theoretic abelian/non-abelian correspondence conjecture, relating the quantum K-ring of a GIT quotient $X//G$ to a certain twist of the quantum K-ring of $X//T$, the quotient by the maximal torus. We prove this conjecture for the case of Grassmanians, and use this to give another proof of the Whitney relations of Mihalcea-Gu-Sharpe-Zhou.</description>

      <title>Algebraic cycles and Hitchin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study motivic aspects of the Hitchin system for $\mathrm{GL}_n$. Our results include the following. (a) We prove the motivic decomposition conjecture of Corti-Hanamura for the Hitchin system; in particular, the decomposition theorem associated with the Hitchin system is induced by algebraic cycles. This yields an unconditional construction of the motivic perverse filtration for the Hitchin system, which lifts the cohomological/sheaf-theoretic perverse filtration. (b) We prove that the inverse of the relative Hard Lefschetz symmetry is induced by a relative algebraic correspondence, confirming the relative Lefschetz standard conjecture for the Hitchin system. (c) We show a strong perversity bound for the normalized Chern classes of a universal bundle with respect to the motivic perverse filtration; this specializes to the sheaf-theoretic result obtained earlier by Maulik-Shen. (d) We prove a $\chi$-independence result for the relative Chow motives associated with Hitchin systems.
  Our methods combine Fourier transforms for compactified Jacobian fibrations associated with integral locally planar curves, nearby and vanishing cycle techniques, and a Springer-theoretic interpretation of parabolic Hitchin moduli spaces.</description>

In both cases, we demonstrate that the dual web is flat.</description>

Abstract: Over a smooth projective toric variety we study toric sheaves, that is, reflexive sheaves equivariant with respect to the acting torus, from a polyhedral point of view. One application is the explicit construction of the torus invariant universal extension of two nef line bundles via polyhedral inclusion/exclusion sequences.
  Second, we link the cohomology of toric sheaves to the cohomology of certain constructible sheaves explicitly built out of the associated polyhedra. For the latter we define a concrete double complex and a spectral sequence which computes the cohomology of toric sheaves from the reduced cohomology of polyhedral subsets living in the realification of the character lattice of the toric variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective smooth surface over $\mathbb{C}$ with $H^2(\mathcal{O}_X)=0$. Let $M=M(L,\chi)$ be the moduli space of 1-dimensional semistable sheaves with determinant $\mathcal{O}_X(L)$ and Euler characteristic $\chi$. We have the Hilbert-Chow morphism $\pi:M\rightarrow |L|$. We give explicit forms of the higher direct images $R^i\pi_*\mathcal{O}_M$ under some mild conditions on $M$ and $|L|$. Our result shows that $R^i\pi_*\mathcal{O}_M$ are direct sums of line bundles. In particular, using our result one gets explicit formulas for the Euler characteristic of $\pi^*\mathcal{O}_{|L|}(m)$, which in $X=\mathbb{P}^2$ case was once conjectured by Chung-Moon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss symmetrical monoidal $\infty$-categoricalizations in relevant $p$-adic functional analysis and $p$-adic analytic geometry. Our motivation has three sources relevant in $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence: one is the corresponding foundation from Bambozzi-Ben-Bassat-Kremnizer on derived functional analysis and Clausen-Scholze on derived topologicalization, and the second one is representations of derived $E_1$-rings which is relevant in integral deformed version of the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence with eventually Banach coefficients, and the third one is the corresponding comparison of the solid quasicoherent sheaves over two kinds of generalized prismatization stackifications over small arc stacks and small $v$-stacks: one from the de Rham Robba stackification, and the other one from the de Rham prismatization stackification. Small arc stacks imperfectize the prismatization stackification, which will then perfectize the prismatization stackification when we regard them as small $v$-stacks. After Scholze's philosophy, one can in fact imperfectize those significant $v$-stacks in Fargues-Scholze to still have the geometrization at least by using Berkovich motives. Both small arc-stacks and small $v$-stacks can be studied using local totally disconnectedness which is the key observation for condensed mathematics, theory of diamonds and perfectoid rings.</description>

We also discuss (conjectural) extension of this equivalence to the case of quantum supergroups and to some exceptional supergroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct K-theoretic and elliptic stable envelopes for certain moduli spaces of vortices, and apply this to enumerative geometry of rational curves in these varieties. In particular, we identify the quantum difference equations in equivariant variables with quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, and give their monodromy in terms of geometric elliptic R-matrices. A novel geometric feature in these constructions is that the varieties under study are not holomorphic symplectic, yet nonetheless have representation-theoretic significance. In physics, they originate from 3d supersymmetric gauge theories with $\mathcal{N} = 2$ rather than $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetry. We discuss an application of the results to the ramified version of the quantum q-Langlands correspondence of Aganagic, Frenkel, and Okounkov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12555v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of arbitrary characteristic. We introduce the notion of commuting exponential maps and formulate the commuting exponential maps conjecture. We show that the weak Abhyankar-Sathaye conjecture is equivalent to the commuting exponential maps conjecture. In particular, we prove that the commuting derivations conjecture $CD(3)$ is true for any field of zero characteristic. We also prove the following results related to ring of invariants of an exponential map of a polynomial ring.
  (1) Let $B=k^{[3]}$ and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}(B)$ be non-trivial. If the plinth ideal $\mathrm{pl} (\delta)$ contains a quasi-basic element, then the ring of invariants ($B^{\delta}$) is $k^{[2]}$.
  (2) Let $B=R^{[n]}$, where $R$ is a $k$-domain and $\delta \in \mathrm{EXP}_R(B)$ is a triangular exponential map. Then $B^{\delta}$ is non-rigid. In particular, for any field $k$ of zero characteristic the kernel of any triangular $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.
  (3) Let $k$ be a field of zero characteristic and $R$ be a $k$-domain. Then the kernel of any linear locally nilpotent $R$-derivation of $R^{[n]}$ is non-rigid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel to [3]. We formulate a natural algebraic geometry conjecture, give some of its number theoretic and analytical consequences, and show that those can be used to get further advances in wave turbulence theory.</description>

      <title>Linear relations of p-adic periods of 1-motives (thesis)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we aim to develop p-adic analogs of known results for classical periods, focusing specifically on 1-motives. We establish an integration theory for 1-motives with good reductions, which generalizes the Colmez-Fontaine-Messing p-adic integration for abelian varieties with good reductions. We also compare the integration pairing with other pairings such as those induced by crystalline theory. Additionally, we introduce a formalism for periods and formulate p-adic period conjectures related to p-adic periods arising from this integration pairing. Broadly, our p-adic period conjecture operates at different depths, with each depth revealing distinct relations among the p-adic periods. Notably, the classical period conjecture (Kontsevich-Zanier conjecture over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$) for 1-periods fits within our framework, and, according to the classical subgroup theorem of Huber-W\"ustholz for 1-motives, the conjecture for classical periods of 1-motives holds true at depth 1. Finally, we identify three $\mathbb{Q}$-structures arising from $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$-rational points of the formal p-divisible group associated with a 1-motive $M$ with a good reduction at $p$, and we prove p-adic period conjectures at depths 2 and 1, relative to periods induced by the p-adic integration of $M$ and these $\mathbb{Q}$-structures. Our proof involves a p-adic version of the subgroup theorem that we obtain for 1-motives with good reductions.</description>

      <title>Finiteness and the Emergence of Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity amplitudes in fully compactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-up prediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular, finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable, meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that of Euclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces to the condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimple representation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supported by a wide variety of string theory examples.</description>
