      <title>Dyonic Taub-NUT-AdS Black Branes: Thermodynamics and Phase Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent developments in the thermodynamics of Taub-NUT spaces and the absence of Misner strings in Taub-NUT solutions with flat horizons, we investigated the phase structure of dyonic Taub-NUT solutions. We follow the treatment proposed in arXiv:2206.09124 and arXiv:2304.06705 to introduce the nut parameter as a conserved charge to the first law. Although the calculated quantities satisfy the first law, we have found a larger class of charges that satisfy the first law and depend on some arbitrary parameter which we call $\alpha$. We choose to describe phase diagrams as NUT parameter-Temperature graphs to show borders of big and small black hole phases. We study the phase structure of these spaces in a mixed ensemble (i.e., we fix the electric potential, the nut parameter, and the magnetic charge), which we classify into different cases depending on the value of $\alpha$. In some of these cases we have first-order phase transitions that end with critical points. These classes could include up to four critical points, again, depending on $\alpha$ and the other quantities.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating black hole in chiral scalar-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral scalar-tensor theory is an extension of the Chern-Simons modified gravity by introducing couplings between the first and second derivatives of the scalar field and parity-violating spacetime curvatures. A key feature of this theory is its explicit breaking of parity symmetry in the gravitational sector, which is expected to affect the spatial-time component of axisymmetric spacetime. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the chiral scalar-tensor theory on slowly rotating black holes by building on known solutions in the dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity. Using perturbative methods with small coupling and slow rotation approximations, we find that the contributions of the chiral scalar-tensor theory appear at quadratic order in the spin and cubic order in the coupling constants. Furthermore, we explore the properties of this solution in the weak field and check its ergosphere and horizon. In the weak limit, we find that the effects of parity violation are suppressed in the weak field but could become significant in the strong field regime. These results provide insights into the behavior of parity-violating gravity in the presence of rotation and may be used for further investigations into its observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Non-interacting holographic dark energy with Torsion via Hubble Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconstruct a holographic dark energy model with a scalar torsion $\phi$ under the assumption of no interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We show that the accelerating expansion can occur by setting the IR cut-off to the Hubble radius as $L=H^{-1}$ with the Hubble parameter $H$. Motivated by two physical choices based on Friedmann equations and the holographic principle, tellingly, spin-induced torsion at non-zero matter density $\rho_m \neq 0$ and $H$-dependence of torsion in empty space $\rho_m =0$, we propose a time-dependent scalar torsion $\phi(t) = k H(t) ({\rho_{m}(t)}/ \rho_c^0)$ with a dimensionless constant $k$ and the current critical density $\rho_c^0$. As a result, we find minima $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$ of the current equation of state for dark energy for various values of the free parameter $c$, yielding $-1 &lt; (\omega_X^{0})_{min} &lt; -0.778$ as $c$ changes from $1$ to $0.654$. Also, we get the values of the current dimensionless ratio, $(\phi_0/H_{0})_{min}$ corresponding to the minima $(\omega^{0}_{X})_{min}$, which is consistent with weak torsion assumption $|\phi_0| /H_{0} &lt; 1$, and thus it ensuring model viability.</description>

      <title>Rotating Casimir Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Casimir Wormhole is a Traversable Wormhole powered by a Casimir energy source within a static reference frame. A natural extension of this system is the inclusion of rotation. We will explore two basic configurations: one with radially varying Casimir plates and another with parametrically fixed plates. In both cases, we will show that rotations do not alter the structure of a Casimir wormhole, and the behavior observed in a static frame is reaffirmed. Since the case with radially varying plates predicts a constant angular velocity as a solution, we must introduce an exponential cut-off and an additional scale to prevent rotations at infinity. This adjustment is not necessary when the plates are kept parametrically fixed. Moreover, the consistency of the Einstein Field Equations is ensured with the help of an additional source without an accompanying energy density, which we interpret as a thermal stress tensor.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs), second-order tensor modes sourced by first-order scalar fluctuations in General Relativity (GR), are expected to contribute to the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) potentially detectable by current and future gravitational wave interferometers. In the framework of GR, this SGWB represents an unavoidable contribution to the gravitational wave spectrum. In this paper, we go beyond GR and we investigate the behavior of SIGWs in f(R) gravity. We explore how the SIGW spectrum is influenced across a broad range of frequencies, from the nano-Hz regime, where the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) operates, through the milli-Hz band probed by the space-based LISA detector, up to the kilo-Hz frequency range, where the ground-based LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA network is currently operational. Our results indicate that the beyond-GR correction leaves an observational imprint, mainly in the low-frequency part of the spectrum, giving the possibility to use SIGW to constrain GR on scales on which we have limited information.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Physics and Cosmology with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of the surrounding world and the universe is an important theme in the legacy of humankind. The detection of gravitational waves is adding a new dimension to this grand effort. What are the fundamental physical laws governing the dynamics of the universe? What is the fundamental composition of the universe? How has the universe evolved in the past and how will it evolve in the future? These are the basic questions that press for answers. The space-based gravitational wave detector TianQin will tune in to gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency range ($10^{-4} \sim 1$ Hz, to be specific), opening a new gravitational wave spectrum window to explore many of the previously hidden sectors of the universe. TianQin will discover many astrophysical systems, populating the universe at different redshifts: some will be of new types that have never been detected before, some will have very high signal-to-noise ratios, and some will have very high parameter estimation precision. The plethora of information collected will bring us to new fronts on which to search for the breaking points of general relativity, the possible violation of established physical laws, the signature of possible new gravitational physics and new fundamental fields, and to improve our knowledge on the expansion history of the universe. In this white paper, we highlight the advances that TianQin can bring to fundamental physics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Love numbers beyond GR from the modified Teukolsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the full set of tidal Love numbers of non-rotating black holes in an effective field theory extension of general relativity. We achieve our results using a recently introduced modified Teukolsky equation that describes the perturbations of black holes in this theory. We show how to identify the Love numbers and their beta functions in a systematic and gauge invariant way, applying analytic continuation on the angular number $\ell$ when necessary. We observe that there are three types of Love numbers: electric, magnetic, and a ``mixing'' type, associated to parity-breaking theories, that we identify here for the first time. The modified Teukolsky equation proves to be very useful as it allows us to obtain all the different Love numbers in a unified framework. We compare our results with previous literature that utilized the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations to compute Love numbers, finding perfect agreement. The method introduced here paves the way towards the computation of Love numbers of rotating black holes beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Gentle spaghettification in effective LQG dust collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective dust collapse inspired by loop quantum gravity predicts two main features for general realistic initial profiles: a quantum gravitational bounce of the stellar core, when the energy density becomes planckian, and shell-crossing singularities, arising within almost a planckian time after the bounce. The aim of this work is to study the mathematical and physical features of the effective spacetime near these singularities, through the Jacobi deviation equation. The results show that the radial and angular deviations between dust particles remain finite at both the bounce and shell-crossing singularity, providing a physical justification for extending the spacetime beyond shell-crossing singularities through weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Stability of multi-state configurations of fuzzy dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability properties of multi-state configurations of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system without self-interaction, with monopolar and first dipolar components $(1,0,0)$+$(2,1,0)$. We show these configurations studied are stable using numerical simulations, and using criteria of stationarity, unitarity and time dependence consistency. The study covers a range of states with monopolar to dipolar mass ratio between 47 and 0.17. The astrophysical implication of this result is that this type of configurations is at least stable and can be considered physically sound in multi-state ultralight bosonic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Nyquist-resolving gravitational waves via orbital frequency-based refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement efficiently facilitates the computation of gravitational waveforms in numerical relativity. However, determining precisely when, where, and to what extent to refine when solving the Einstein equations poses challenges; several ad hoc refinement criteria have been explored in the literature. This work introduces an optimized resolution baseline derived in situ from the inspiral trajectory (ORBIT). This method uses the binary's orbital frequency as a proxy for anticipated gravitational waves to dynamically refine the grid, satisfying the Nyquist frequency requirements on grid resolution up to a specified spin weighted spherical harmonic order. ORBIT sustains propagation of gravitational waves while avoiding the more costly alternative of maintaining high resolution across an entire simulation, both spatially and temporally. We find that enabling ORBIT decreases waveform noise by an order of magnitude and better resolves high-order wave amplitudes through merger. Combined with WAMR and other improvements, updates to Dendro-GR decrease waveform noise, decrease constraint violations, and boost refinement efficiency each by factors of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while reducing computational cost by a factor of four. ORBIT and other recent improvements to Dendro-GR begin to prepare us for gravitational wave science with next-generation detectors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.00722v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new family of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) propagating on a regular $(1+2)$D spacetime lattice is introduced. The continuous limit of these DTQWs is shown to coincide with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion interacting with an arbitrary relativistic gravitational field. This family is used to model the influence of arbitrary linear gravitational waves (GWs) on DTQWs. Pure shear GWs are studied in detail. On large spatial scales, pure shear GWs do not modify the polarizations of the fermion eigen-modes, but rescale all energies by a common factor. On smaller scales typically comparable to two or three lattice steps, both polarizations and energies are modified in a non-trivial way. This effect is particularly salient on interference patterns between the fermion eigen-modes.</description>

Abstract: It was recently proposed (arxiv:2502.08887) that the time crystal Lagrangian introduced by Shapere and Wilczek in 2012 could be a model of dark energy. I point out that the model has an instability that drives its energy density to negative values, which may render it unsuitable as a model of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find explicit de Sitter shockwave solutions in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. We use these to determine the dimensional-dependent "stretching" of the de Sitter Penrose diagram in the presence of a shock or black hole. This stretching sets the scale at which superluminalities in de Sitter can be considered resolvable. We then consider an RFF coupling for a spin-1 particle and a Gauss-Bonnet coupling for a spin-2 particle and analyze these in terms of our proposed de Sitter causality criteria. We briefly discuss the connections between our results and corresponding results in anti de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Orbital Chaos: The Wild Heart of Fuzzy Dark Matter Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of test particles on top of a galactic-type of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) structure, characterized by the core-halo density profile found in simulations. Our workhorse structure is an anisotropic, time-dependent, virialized core-tail FDM clump resulting from a multicore merger. For our analysis we allow this structure to keep evolving, which implies that the core oscillates and accretes matter from the halo, while the halo dynamics is dominated by its characteristic high kinetic energy. On top of this time-dependent structure that in turn has a time-dependent gravitational potential, we solve the motion equations of test particles with initial conditions associated to circular orbits at different radii. Our results indicate that: 1) no trajectory remains circular, 2) the trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions and 3) the departure of initially near trajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent. A qualitative result is that the motion of test particles is more erratic with a bigger Lyapunov exponent within and near the core than in the halo region, which can be understood in terms of the random motion of the core within the core-halo structure. We expect these results warn on the importance of the anisotropic and time-dependent nature of FDM clumps when studying the motion of test particles.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.</description>

      <title>Model spaces as constrained Hamiltonian systems: I. Application to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by group-theoretical questions that arise in the context of asymptotic symmetries in gravity, we study model spaces and their quantization from the viewpoint of constrained Hamiltonian systems. More precisely, we propose a definition of a model space for a generic Lie group $G$ as a suitable second class constrained system associated to the cotangent bundle $T^{*}G$. Before turning to the non-compact infinite-dimensional groups relevant in the gravitational setting, we work out all details in the simplest case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Besides recovering well-known results on the quantum theory of angular momentum from a unified perspective, the analysis sheds some light on the definition and properties of spin-weighted/monopole spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>Inferring Black Hole Spin from Interferometric Measurements of the First Photon Ring: A Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately inferring black hole spin is crucial for understanding black hole dynamics and their astrophysical environments. In this work, we outline a geometric method for spin estimation by using the interferometric shape of the first photon ring ($n=1$) as an approximation to the critical curve, which, given an assumed value of the black hole inclination, is then mapped to a spin value. While future space-based missions will capture a wealth of data on the first photon ring--including the full angle-dependent diameter, angular brightness profile, and astrometric offset from the $n=0$ ring--our analysis is restricted to using only two angle-dependent diameters to compute its shape asymmetry and infer spin. Focusing on low inclinations and moderate-to-high spins, we test the method across various emission models, baselines, and noise sources, including a mock space-based observation. Although the size of the $n=1$ ring depends on the emission model, its interferometric shape remains a robust spin probe at low inclinations. We find that the inferred asymmetry of the $n=1$ image may be biased by the critical curve morphology, and it can be heavily skewed by the presence of noise, whether astrophysical or instrumental. In low-noise limits at low viewing inclination, significant contributions from the n=0 image at short baselines may lead to a downward bias in asymmetry estimates. While our method can estimate high spins in noise-free time-averaged images, increasing the noise and astrophysical variability degrades the resulting constraints, providing only lower bounds on the spin when applied to synthetic observed data. Remarkably, even using only the ring's asymmetry, we can establish lower bounds on the spin, underscoring the promise of photon ring-based spin inference in future space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) missions, such as the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX).</description>

      <title>Linear matter density perturbations in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model: Examining growth dynamics and addressing the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate linear matter density perturbations in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, in which the $\Lambda$ is replaced by late-time ($z\sim2$) mirror AdS-dS transition, resulting in distinct growth dynamics. We use two complementary approaches: (i) determining the initial density contrast and its evolution rate for a given collapse scale factor, (ii) computing the collapse scale factor for a specified initial density contrast and evolution rate. We derive analytical solutions for the growth rate $f=\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$ and growth index $\gamma$ in both models. Prior to the transition, the AdS-like $\Lambda$ reduces cosmic friction, causing linear matter density perturbations to grow more rapidly than in $\Lambda$CDM; this effect is most pronounced just before the transition, with a growth rate around $15\%$ higher than $\Lambda$CDM around $z\sim2$. After the transition, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM behaves similarly to $\Lambda$CDM but features a larger cosmological constant, leading to higher $H(z)$ and greater cosmic friction that more effectively suppresses growth. Before the transition, $\gamma$ remains below both the $\Lambda$CDM and EdS values ($\gamma\approx6/11$); during the transition, it increases rapidly and then grows gradually, paralleling $\Lambda$CDM while remaining slightly higher in the post-transition era-though overall, it stays near $\gamma\sim0.55$. Using the Planck best-fit values, $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.28$ for $\Lambda_{\mathrm{s}}$CDM and $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.32$ for $\Lambda$CDM, we find $f=0.49$ and $f=0.53$, respectively. $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM predicts a value of $f=0.48$, recently obtained from LSS data when $\gamma$ is treated as a free parameter in $\Lambda$CDM. This suggests that $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM may resolve the structure growth anomaly, without deviating from $\gamma \sim 0.55$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze Hamiltonian gravity in the limit of a vanishing (spatial) triad determinant. In the context of Barbero-Immirzi formulation, the Lorentzian constraints in this limit are found to exhibit a formal similarity to the Euclidean constraints of Ashtekar's self-dual formulation, modulo the difference that the spatial diffeomorphisms become trivial. Further, we show that the Carrollian limit of gravity emerges as a special case, thus providing it a geometric interpretation independent of either the speed of light or coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Revisiting van Citter Zernike correlations in the presence of primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00474v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a detailed construction of quantum field theory of interaction between a generic GW background and a spherical electromagnetic (EM) field. This scenario is applicable to the EM emission from furthest stars. After identification of the evolution of the EM field, we show that the background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) predicted by the inflationary scenario induces a decrease in the spatial coherence of the EM field propagating over cosmological distances, leading the van Citter-Zernike correlations to become unobservable, an effect called as blurring. Since spatial correlation is observed in VLBI measurements of distant quasars, it imposes a constraint on the level of the primordial gravitational wave background. We evaluate the blurring effect caused by PGWs placed in two-mode squeezed state which is the standard quantum state predicted by the simplest scenario of inflation. As a result of the small coupling strength between GWs and EM probe, the incoherence induced by PGWs is far beyond the coherence length in VLBI measurements, which finally renders the detection of PGWs based on interferometric setups. The main idea of the present study is to promote the use of high-precision VLBI measurement of angular size-redshift of distant sources, as a new possible way of constraining the underlying primordial background, in parallel to other surveys such as the cosmic microwave background. In particular, the present schema can pave the way to search for the effect of scalar curvature perturbations in the VLBI $\theta-z$ measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19140v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the information loss issue for completely evaporating black holes in the context of a globally hyperbolic spacetime that maintains unchanged the entire semiclassical picture except for the "last evaporation breath," which pertains to full quantum gravity. Even though observers outside the black hole cannot access information that enters the horizon, there is no actual loss of information imposed by the spacetime causal structure since it is carried over from one Cauchy surface to the next (provided the local evolution is unitary).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the motion of the spinning body (in the pole-dipole approximation) in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon-Souriau equations. First, we define a novel spin condition for the body with the magnetic dipole moment proportional to spin, which generalizes the one proposed by Ohashi-Kyrian-Semer\'ak for gravity. As a result, we get the whole family of charged spinning particle models in the curved spacetime with remarkably simple dynamics (momentum and velocity are parallel). Applying the reparametrization procedure, for a specific dipole moment, we obtain equations of motion with constant mass and gyromagnetic factor. Next, we show that these equations follow from an effective Hamiltonian formalism, previously interpreted as a classical model of the charged Dirac particle.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the effect of higher dimensions on the black hole silhouette, deflection angles, and PINN approximated quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the effects of higher dimensions on the observable properties of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes, focusing on the photonsphere, shadow radius, deflection angles, and quasinormal modes (QNMs). By extending classical methods with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), the research examines how increasing dimensionality alters these properties, causing shadow size reduction, weaker deflection angles, and shifts in QNM frequencies. The findings suggest that as black holes increase in dimensionality, their gravitational influence diminishes, particularly affecting light deflection and the stability of photon orbits. Through both weak and strong deflection analyses, this study indicates the need for ultrasensitive technology to detect these higher-dimensional signatures. Remarks on the observational data constraints currently favor four-dimensional spacetime; however, the exploration of additional dimensions remains vital in advancing models of quantum gravity. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding black hole behavior in higher dimensions, potentially informing future astrophysical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linearised relativistic elasticity equations of motion are considered for a rod and a spinning ring encountering a gravitational wave. In the case of the rod, the equations reduce to a wave equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Using Fourier transforms, the resonant frequencies are found and an explicit distributional solution is given, both for a plus- and a cross-polarised gravitational wave. In the case of the spinning ring, the equations are coupled wave equations with periodic boundary conditions. Using a Fourier series expansion, the system of wave equations is recast as a family of ordinary differential equations for the Fourier coefficients, which are then solved via Fourier transforms. The resonant frequencies are found, including simple approximate expressions for slowly rotating rings, and an explicit distributional solution is obtained in the case of the non-spinning ring. Interestingly, it is possible to tune the resonant frequencies by adjusting the angular velocity of the spinning ring.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational lensing by Bardeen black hole in cloud of strings (CoS) in strong field limit. The effect of CoS parameter $b$ has been outlined in comparison with Bardeen black hole lens. The strong deflection limit coefficients are determined in terms of impact parameter for various values of CoS parameter. We obtain magnification of relativistic images and determine relativistic Einstein rings by using the parameters of two astrophysical black hole lenses $SgrA^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. We constrain CoS parameter of Bardeen black hole using EHT observations for these black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass transfer process is prevalent during the inspiral phase of compact binary systems. Our study focuses on systems comprising low-mass white dwarfs, particularly in neutron star-white dwarf binaries and double white dwarf binaries, where a stable mass transfer process occurs at low frequencies. By analyzing the evolution of gravitational wave frequencies in the presence of mass transfer within quasi-circular orbits, we derive an analytical expression for the time-dependent frequency across different frequency bands and the waveforms emitted by compact binaries. Considering gravitational waves emitted by compact binaries in the $1\thicksim10$ mHz band, based on the Fisher analysis, we find that the mass transfer rate can be measured as accurately as $10^{-7} M_\odot/\text{year}$ by space-based gravitational-wave detectors with a signal-to-noise ratio of the order of $10^3$. Including the mass transfer effect in the waveforms provides a new possibility to measure the individual masses of double white dwarf binaries. The relative error of measured white dwarf masses can be down to the order of $0.01$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that nonsingular black holes realized in nonlinear electrodynamics are always prone to Laplacian instability around the center because of a negative squared sound speed in the angular direction. This is the case for both electric and magnetic BHs, where the instability of one of the vector-field perturbations leads to enhancing a dynamical gravitational perturbation in the even-parity sector. Thus, the background regular metric is no longer maintained in a steady state. Our results suggest that the construction of stable, nonsingular black holes with regular centers, if they exist, requires theories beyond nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory: new results from post-Newtonian and self-force theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the (displacement) gravitational wave memory due to a quasicircular inspiral of two black holes using a variety of perturbative techniques. Within post-Newtonian theory, we extend previous results for non-spinning binaries to 3.5PN order. Using the gravitational self-force approach, we compute the memory at first order in the mass ratio for inspirals into a Kerr black hole. We do this both numerically and via a double post-Newtonian--self-force expansion which we carry out to 5PN order. At second order in the self-force approach, near-zone calculations encounter an infrared divergence associated with memory, which is resolved through matching the near-zone solution to a post-Minkowskian expansion in the far zone. We describe that matching procedure for the first time and show how it introduces nonlocal-in-time memory effects into the two-body dynamics at second order in the mass ratio, as was also predicted by recent 5PN calculations within the effective field theory approach. We then compute the gravitational-wave memory through second order in the mass ratio (excluding certain possible memory distortion effects) and find that it agrees well with recent results from numerical relativity simulations for near-comparable-mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Postmerger multimessenger analysis of binary neutron stars: Effect of the magnetic field strength and topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The oscillation modes of neutron star (NS) merger remnants, as encoded by the kHz postmerger gravitational wave (GW) signal, hold great potential for constraining the as-yet undetermined equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter. Previous works have used numerical relativity simulations to derive quasi-universal relations for the key oscillation frequencies, but most of them omit the effects of a magnetic field. We conduct full general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of NSNS mergers with two different masses and two different EOSs (SLy and ALF2) with three different initial magnetic field topologies (poloidal and toroidal only, confined to the interior, and "pulsar-like": dipolar poloidal extending from the interior to the exterior), with four different magnetic field strengths with maximum values ranging from from $5.5\times 10^{15}G$ to $2.2\times 10^{17}G$ at the time of insertion. We find that magnetic braking and magnetic effective turbulent viscosity drives the merger remnants towards uniform rotation and increases their overall angular momentum loss. As a result, the $f_2$ frequency of the dominant postmerger GW mode shifts upwards over time. The overall shift is up to $\sim 200$Hz for the strongest magnetic field we consider and $\sim 50$Hz for the median case and is therefore detectable in principle by future GW observatories, which should include the magnetic field in their analyses. We also explore the impact of the magnetic field on the postmerger electromagnetic emission, and demonstrate that an extremely large magnetic field, or alternatively a significant shear viscosity mechanism, can cause a supramassive NS remnant to collapse to a BH in less than 100ms and lead to jet formation, although we do not expect the conditions for such an outcome to be realistic.</description>

      <title>Spacetime-curvature induced uncertainty principle: linking the large-structure global effects to the local black hole physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper links the advanced formulation of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, termed the Asymptotic Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (AGEUP), to the corpuscular framework to derive the AGEUP-inspired black hole metric. The former incorporates spacetime curvature effects to explore black hole dynamics under quantum gravitational corrections, while the latter is a view that black holes are Bose-Einstein condensates of weakly interacting gravitons. In a particular case, the phenomenological union between the AGEUP with cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to the corpuscular framework enabled a black hole metric that has a scaled mass, which depends on $\Lambda$ and the Planck length $l_{\rm Pl}$. Interesting implications occur, such as the maximum limit for mass $M$ where $\Lambda$ ceases to influence the black hole. Another is the derived value of the modulation factor of the EUP term, $\alpha$, if the large-scale fundamental length is defined solely as the cosmological horizon. Additional analyses were done through the shadow and deflection angle phenomena, deriving constraints on the quantum gravity modulation parameter $\beta$. Constraints from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) are discussed as avenues for verifying AGEUP-related deviations in black hole shadow radius and deflection angles, offering potential observational evidence of quantum gravitational effects at astrophysical scales. The findings suggest that AGEUP could be instrumental in providing hints on the quantum gravity nature of black holes, particularly in high-energy astrophysical contexts. By linking local black hole physics with large-scale curvature effects, AGEUP paves the way for further research at the intersection of quantum gravity and cosmology, with implications for observational astrophysics and the fundamental structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space formalisms for group field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group field theory is a background-independent approach to quantum gravity whose starting point is the definition of a quantum field theory on an auxiliary group manifold (not interpreted as spacetime, but rather as the finite-dimensional configuration space of a single "atom" of geometry). Group field theory models can be seen as an extension of matrix and tensor models by additional data, and are traditionally defined through a functional integral whose perturbative expansion generates a sum over discrete geometries. More recently, some efforts have been directed towards formulations of group field theory based on a Hilbert space and operators, in particular in applications to cosmology. This is an attempt to review some of these formulations and their main ideas, to disentangle these constructions as much as possible from applications and phenomenology, and to put them into a wider context of quantum gravity research.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal gravity in a proper tetrad frame: traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity involving four auxiliary scalar fields, introduced to explain the standard cosmological background expansion history without fine-tuning issues. In particular, we simplify the complex field equations within a proper tetrad frame, thereby recasting the original system into a more tractable equivalent differential problem. We show that, by initially postulating the form of the $g_{tt}$ metric component, it is possible to reconstruct the distortion function of the gravitational model. We then describe a step-by-step procedure for solving the vacuum field equations in the case of a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We apply our technique to find new traversable wormholes supported purely by gravity by employing either analytical, perturbative, or numerical methods. Finally, we discuss the main geometric properties of the obtained solutions. Our results present a feasible avenue for identifying novel compact objects while enhancing the comprehension of nonlocal gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing and accretion disk imaging of a Buchdahl dense core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing and accretion disk imaging characteristics of a dense core modeled by the Buchdahl spacetime. By imposing the appropriate energy conditions and ensuring the absence of curvature singularities, we delineate the parameter space in which the dense core mimics key gravitational features of black holes while exhibiting unique deviations. We derive the photon orbital equation and calculate deflection angles, clearly distinguishing between weak- and strong-deflection regimes. Furthermore, we construct a mapping from the illuminated, geometrically thin accretion disk onto the observer's screen -- focusing on the isoradial curves corresponding to a representative source ring. For compactness values below a critical threshold, only a finite number of disk images are formed. In this range, their secondary and higher-order images typically display double-loop structures, with each loop individually capturing the entire source ring. Notably, the highest-order image sometimes appears as a single, crescent-shaped loop that does not enclose the screen's center, implying the existence of a cutoff angle that restricts the imaged portion of the source ring. In contrast, for compactness values above the critical threshold, an infinite sequence of double-loop structures appears -- a behavior closely linked to the presence of a photon sphere. These findings suggest that the lensing signatures of dense cores can distinguish them from black holes, offering new insights for high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Calculating Bayesian evidence for inflationary models using CONNECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence is a standard tool used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days.
  Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models.
  In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.</description>

      <title>Implications of DES 5YR SNe Dataset for $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy (DE) deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model.Here we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing primarily frequentist profile likelihoods, supported by complementary Bayesian methods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES data up to a point that there is a $2.5 \sigma$ discrepancy with Planck. We relax the traditional $\Omega_m \leq 1$ prior to demonstrate negative DE densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$ at the highest effective redshift probed. Nevertheless, the largest discrepancy with Planck occurs for profile likelihoods and posteriors peaked at $\Omega_m &lt; 1$ in the traditional $\Lambda$CDM regime. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

      <title>(Quasi-)normal modes of rotating black holes and new solitons in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalar field (quasi-)normal modes of recently derived rotating black holes within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point in five dimensions. We also examine the mode spectrum of these probes on new static gravitational solitons. These solitons, featuring a regular center, are constructed from static black holes with gravitational hair via a double analytic continuation. By imposing ingoing boundary conditions at the horizons of rotating black holes, ensuring regularity at the soliton centers, and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at infinity, we obtain numerical spectra for the rotating black holes and solitons. For static black holes, we demonstrate analytically that the imaginary part of the mode frequencies is negative. Our analysis of the massless Klein-Gordon equation on five-dimensional geometries reveals an infinite family of gaped, massive three-dimensional Klein-Gordon fields, despite the presence of a non-compact extended direction. For the static solitons, the frequencies are real and non-equispaced, whereas in the rotating black holes, counter-rotating modes are absorbed more quickly, and the imaginary part of the co-rotating modes approaches zero as extremality is approached. Additionally, we show that both the rotating black holes and solitons can be equipped with non-trivial torsion, leading to a novel branch of solutions.</description>

      <title>String Theory in a Pinch: Resolving the Gregory-Laflamme Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin enough black strings are unstable to growing ripples along their length, eventually pinching and forming a naked singularity on the horizon. We investigate how string theory can resolve this singularity. First, we study the string-scale version of the static non-uniform black strings that branch off at the instability threshold: "string-ball strings", which are linearly extended, self-gravitating configurations of string balls obtained in the Horowitz-Polchinski (HP) approach to near-Hagedorn string states. We construct non-uniform HP strings in spatial dimensions $d\leq 6$ and show that, as the inhomogeneity increases, they approach localized HP balls. We also examine the thermodynamic properties of the different phases in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles. We find that, for a sufficiently small mass, the uniform HP string will be stable and not evolve into a non-uniform or localized configuration. Building on these results and independent evidence from the evolution of the black string instability with $\alpha'$ corrections, we propose that, at least in $d=4,5$, string theory slows and eventually halts the pinching evolution at a classically stable stringy neck. In $d\geq 6$ this transition is likely to occur into a puffed-up string ball. The system then enters a slower phase in which the neck gradually evaporates into radiation. We discuss this scenario as a framework for understanding how string theory resolves the formation of naked singularities.</description>

Abstract: These notes aim to provide an introduction to the basics of black hole thermodynamics. After explaining Bekenstein's original proposal that black holes have entropy, we discuss Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation, its analog for Rindler space in the Unruh effect, the Euclidean approach to black hole thermodynamics, some basics about von Neumann entropy and its applications, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, and the nature of a white hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Effects of a Small Primordial Black Hole Passing Through the Human Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational effects of a primordial black hole (PBH) passing through the human body are examined, with the goal of determining the minimum mass necessary to produce significant injury or death. Two effects are examined: the damage caused by a shock wave propagating outward from the black hole trajectory, and the dissociation of brain cells from tidal forces produced by the black hole on its passage through the human body. It is found that the former is the dominant effect, with a cutoff mass for serious injury or death of approximately $M_{PBH} &gt; 1.4 \times 10^{17} {\rm g}$. The number density of primordial black holes with a mass above this cutoff is far too small to produce any observable effects on the human population.</description>
