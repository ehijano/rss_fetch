      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of Coupled-Resonator Kerr-Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear interaction of a microresonator pumped by a laser has revealed complex dynamics including soliton formation and chaos. Initial studies of coupled-resonator systems reveal even more complicated dynamics that can lead to deterministic modelocking and efficient comb generation. Here we perform theoretical analysis and experiments that provide insight into the dynamical behavior of coupled-resonator systems operating in the normal group-velocity-dispersion regime. Our stability analysis and simulations reveal that the strong mode-coupling regime, which gives rise to spectrally-broad comb states, can lead to an instability mechanism in the auxiliary resonator that destabilizes the comb state and prevents mode-locking. We find that this instability can be suppressed by introducing loss in the auxiliary resonator. We investigate the stability of both single- and multi-pulse solutions and verify our theoretical predictions by performing experiments in a silicon-nitride platform. Our results provide an understanding for accessing broad, efficient, relatively flat high-power mode-locked combs for numerous applications in spectroscopy, time-frequency metrology, and data communications.</description>

      <title>Spiral, Core-defect and Wave break in a modified Oregonator Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target waves and spiral waves were discovered in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction around 50 years ago. Many biological systems demonstrate such rotating spiral patterns. Spiral waves are widely encountered in the glycolytic activity of yeast and cardiac and neuronal tissues. In the cardiac system, the spiral waves and their three dimensional counterparts, the scroll waves are the cause of arrhythmia. These waves are also widely studied in the experimental BZ reaction as a table-top model of the cardiac system. To understand the underlying physics or chemistry of the system, the Oregonator model is considered in correlation to the BZ reaction system. In this study, starting from the same FKN mechanism, we slightly modify the original Oregonator model. We present a three-variable model that can be called a modified Oregonator model in which we observe the presence of the spiral, spiral defect, and spiral breakup by tuning the parameters.</description>
