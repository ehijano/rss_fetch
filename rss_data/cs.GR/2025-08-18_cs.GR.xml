      <title>LayoutRectifier: An Optimization-based Post-processing for Graphic Design Layout Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent deep learning methods can generate diverse graphic design layouts efficiently. However, these methods often create layouts with flaws, such as misalignment, unwanted overlaps, and unsatisfied containment. To tackle this issue, we propose an optimization-based method called LayoutRectifier, which gracefully rectifies auto-generated graphic design layouts to reduce these flaws while minimizing deviation from the generated layout. The core of our method is a two-stage optimization. First, we utilize grid systems, which professional designers commonly use to organize elements, to mitigate misalignments through discrete search. Second, we introduce a novel box containment function designed to adjust the positions and sizes of the layout elements, preventing unwanted overlapping and promoting desired containment. We evaluate our method on content-agnostic and content-aware layout generation tasks and achieve better-quality layouts that are more suitable for downstream graphic design tasks. Our method complements learning-based layout generation methods and does not require additional training.</description>

      <title>StyleMM: Stylized 3D Morphable Face Model via Text-Driven Aligned Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability.

      <title>SPG: Style-Prompting Guidance for Style-Specific Content Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at aligning generated images with textual prompts, controlling the visual style of the output remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose Style-Prompting Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation. SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple, robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Rumbling281441/SPG.</description>

      <title>ViPE: Video Pose Engine for 3D Geometric Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios, including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around 100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI systems.</description>

      <title>Casual3DHDR: Deblurring High Dynamic Range 3D Gaussian Splatting from Casually Captured Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has gained significant attention for its superior performance. However, most existing methods rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, limiting their ability to capture detailed scenes in high-contrast environments. While some prior works address high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, they typically require multi-view sharp images with varying exposure times captured at fixed camera positions, which is time-consuming and impractical. To make data acquisition more flexible, we propose \textbf{Casual3DHDR}, a robust one-stage method that reconstructs 3D HDR scenes from casually-captured auto-exposure (AE) videos, even under severe motion blur and unknown, varying exposure times. Our approach integrates a continuous-time camera trajectory into a unified physical imaging model, jointly optimizing exposure times, camera trajectory, and the camera response function (CRF). Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \textbf{Casual3DHDR} outperforms existing methods in robustness and rendering quality. Our source code and dataset will be available at https://lingzhezhao.github.io/CasualHDRSplat/</description>
