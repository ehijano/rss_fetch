      <title>Effect of an electric field on liquid helium scintillation produced by fast electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.03061v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dependence on applied electric field ($0 - 40$ kV/cm) of the scintillation light produced by fast electrons and $\alpha$ particles stopped in liquid helium in the temperature range of 0.44 K to 3.12 K is reported. For both types of particles, the reduction in the intensity of the scintillation signal due to the applied field exhibits an apparent temperature dependence. Using an approximate solution of the Debye-Smoluchowski equation, we show that the apparent temperature dependence for electrons can be explained by the time required for geminate pairs to recombine relative to the detector signal integration time. This finding indicates that the spatial distribution of secondary electrons with respect to their geminate partners possesses a heavy, non-Gaussian tail at larger separations, and has a dependence on the energy of the primary ionization electron. We discuss the potential application of this result to pulse shape analysis for particle detection and discrimination.</description>

      <title>Observation of surface Fermi arcs in altermagnetic Weyl semimetal CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a special type of collinear antiferromagnetism (AFM), altermagnetism has garnered significant research interest recently. Altermagnets exhibit broken parity-time symmetry and zero net magnetization in real space, leading to substantial band splitting in momentum space even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, parity-time symmetry breaking always induce nontrivial band topology such as Weyl nodes. While Weyl semimetal states and nodal lines have been theoretically proposed in altermagnets, rare reports of experimental observation have been made up to this point. Using ARPES and first-principles calculations, we systematically studied the electronic structure of the room-temperature altermagnet candidate CrSb. At generic locations in momentum space, we clearly observed band spin splitting. Furthermore, we identified discrete surface Fermi arcs on the (100) cleaved side surface close to the Fermi level originating from bulk band topology. Our results imply that CrSb contains interesting nontrivial topological Weyl physics, in addition to being an excellent room temperature altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Programmable adiabatic demagnetization for systems with trivial and topological excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple, robust protocol to prepare a low-energy state of an arbitrary Hamiltonian on a quantum computer or programmable quantum simulator. The protocol is inspired by the adiabatic demagnetization technique, used to cool solid-state systems to extremely low temperatures. A fraction of the qubits (or spins) is used to model a spin bath that is coupled to the system. By an adiabatic ramp down of a simulated Zeeman field acting on the bath spins, energy and entropy are extracted from the system. The bath spins are then measured and reset to the polarized state, and the process is repeated until convergence to a low-energy steady state is achieved. We demonstrate the protocol via application to the quantum Ising model. We study the protocol's performance in the presence of noise and show how the information from the measurement of the bath spins can be used to monitor the cooling process. The performance of the algorithm depends on the nature of the excitations of the system; systems with non-local (topological) excitations are more difficult to cool than those with local excitations. We explore the possible mitigation of this problem by trapping topological excitations.</description>

      <title>He-4 monolayer on Graphene: a Quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02033v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of adsorption of a single He-4 layer on graphene, focusing on the commensurate C1/3 crystalline phase, specifically on whether it may possess a nonzero superfluid response, and on the existence of superfluid phases, either (metastable) liquid or vacancy-doped crystalline. We make use of canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero and finite temperature, based on a realistic microscopic model of the system. Our results confirm the absence of any superfluid response in the commensurate crystal, and that no thermodynamically stable uniform phase exists at lower coverage. No evidence of a possibly long-lived, metastable superfluid phase at C1/3 coverage is found. Altogether, the results of ground-state projection methods and finite-temperature simulations are entirely consistent.</description>

      <title>Extending non-adiabatic rate theory to strong electronic couplings in the Marcus inverted regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron transfer reactions play an essential role in many chemical and biological processes. Fermi's Golden rule, which assumes that the coupling between electronic states is small, has formed the foundation of electron transfer rate theory, however in short range electron/energy transfer reactions this coupling can become very large, and therefore Fermi's Golden Rule fails to make even qualitatively accurate rate predictions. In this paper I present a simple modified Golden Rule theory to describe electron transfer in the Marcus inverted regime at arbitrarily large electronic coupling strengths. The theory is based on an optimal global rotation of the diabatic states, which makes it compatible with existing methods for calculating Golden Rule rates that can account for nuclear quantum effects with anharmonic potentials. Furthermore the Optimal Golden Rule (OGR) theory can also combined with analytic theories for non-adiabatic rates, such as Marcus theory and Marcus-Levich-Jortner theory, offering clear physical insight into strong electronic coupling effects in non-adiabatic processes. OGR theory is also tested on a large set of spin-boson models and an anharmonic model against exact quantum dynamics calculations, where it performs well, correctly predicting rate turnover at large coupling strengths. Finally, an example application to a BODIPY-Anthracene photosensitizer reveals that strong coupling effects inhibit excited state charge recombination in this system, reducing the rate of this process by a factor of four. Overall OGR theory offers a new approach to calculating electron transfer rates at strong couplings, offering new physical insight into a range of non-adiabatic processes.</description>
