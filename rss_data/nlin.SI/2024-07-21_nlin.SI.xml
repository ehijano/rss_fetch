      <title>On the field analogue of elliptic spin Calogero-Moser model: Lax pair and equations of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lax pair for the field analogue of the classical spin elliptic Calogero-Moser is proposed. Namely, using the previously known Lax matrix we suggest an ansatz for the accompany matrix. The presented construction is valid when the matrix of spin variables ${\mathcal S}\in{\rm Mat}(N,\mathbb C)$ satisfies the condition ${\mathcal S}^2=c_0{\mathcal S}$ with some constant $c_0\in\mathbb C$. It is proved that the Lax pair satisfies the Zakharov-Shabat equation with unwanted term, thus providing equations of motion on the unreduced phase space. The unwanted term vanishes after additional reduction. In the special case ${\rm rank}(\mathcal S)=1$ we show that the reduction provides the Lax pair of the spinless field Calogero-Moser model obtained earlier by Akhmetshin, Krichever and Volvovski.</description>

      <title>A novel translationally invariant supersymmetric chain with inverse-square interactions: partition function, thermodynamics and criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel family of translationally-invariant su$(m|n)$ supersymmetric spin chains with long-range interaction not directly associated to a root system. We study the symmetries of these models, establishing in particular the existence of a boson-fermion duality characteristic of this type of systems. Taking advantage of the relation of the new chains with an associated many-body supersymmetric spin dynamical model, we are able to compute their partition function in closed form for all values of $m$ and $n$ and for an arbitrary number of spins. When both $m$ and $n$ are even, we show that the partition function factorizes as the product of the partition functions of two supersymmetric Haldane-Shastry spin chains, which in turn leads to a simple expression for the thermodynamic free energy per spin in terms of the Perron eigenvalue of a suitable transfer matrix. We use this expression to study the thermodynamics of a large class of these chains, showing in particular that the specific heat presents a single Schottky peak at approximately the same temperature as a suitable $k$-level model. We also analyze the critical behavior of the new chains, and in particular the ground state degeneracy and the existence of low energy excitations with a linear energy-momentum dispersion relation. In this way we are able to show that the only possible critical chains are the ones with $m=0,1,2$. In addition, using the explicit formula for the partition function we are able to establish the criticality of the su$(0|n)$ and su$(2|n)$ chains with even $n$, and to evaluate the central charge of their associated conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Perturbed Black Holes: Background Hidden Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the presence of integrable hidden structures in the dynamics of perturbed non-rotating black holes (BHs). This can also be considered as a first step in a wider program of an effective identification of ``slow'' and ``fast'' degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the (binary) BH dynamics, following a wave-mean flow perspective. The slow DoFs would be associated with a nonlinear integrable dynamics, on which the fast ones propagate following an effective linear dynamics. BH perturbation theory offers a natural ground to test these properties. Indeed, the decoupling of Einstein equations into wave master equations with a potential provides an instance of such splitting into (frozen) slow DoFs (background potential) over which the linear dynamics of the fast ones (perturbation master functions) evolve. It has been recently shown that these wave equations possess an infinite number of symmetries that correspond to the flow of the infinite hierarchy of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations. Starting from these results, we systematically investigate the presence of integrable structures in BH perturbation theory. We first study them in Cauchy slices and then extend the analysis to hyperboloidal foliations. This second step introduces a splitting of the master equation into bulk and boundary contributions, unveiling an underlying structural relation with the slow and fast DoFs. This insight represents a first step to establish the integrable structures associated to the slow DoFs as bulk symmetries of the dynamics of perturbed BHs.</description>
