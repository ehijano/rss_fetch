      <title>Quantum-Classical Separation in Bounded-Resource Tasks Arising from Measurement Contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevailing view is that quantum phenomena can be harnessed to tackle certain problems beyond the reach of classical approaches. Quantifying this capability as a quantum-classical separation and demonstrating it on current quantum processors has remained elusive. Using a superconducting qubit processor, we show that quantum contextuality enables certain tasks to be performed with success probabilities beyond classical limits. With a few qubits, we illustrate quantum contextuality with the magic square game, as well as quantify it through a Kochen--Specker--Bell inequality violation. To examine many-body contextuality, we implement the N-player GHZ game and separately solve a 2D hidden linear function problem, exceeding classical success rate in both. Our work proposes novel ways to benchmark quantum processors using contextuality-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Vessel Network Topology in Molecular Communication: Insights from Experiments and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of synthetic molecular communication (MC) refers to the transmission of information via signaling molecules and is foreseen to enable innovative medical applications in the human cardiovascular system (CVS). Crucially, the design of such applications requires accurate and experimentally validated channel models that characterize the propagation of signaling molecules, not just in individual blood vessels, but in complex vessel networks (VNs), as prevalent in the CVS. However, experimentally validated models for MC in VNs remain scarce. To address this gap, we propose a novel channel model for MC in complex VN topologies, which captures molecular transport via advection, molecular and turbulent diffusion, as well as adsorption and desorption at the vessel walls. We specialize this model for superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules by introducing a new receiver (RX) model for planar coil inductive sensors, enabling end-to-end experimental validation with a dedicated SPION testbed. Validation covers a range of channel topologies, from single-vessel topologies to branched VNs with multiple paths between transmitter (TX) and RX. Additionally, to quantify how the VN topology impacts signal quality, and inspired by multi-path propagation models in conventional wireless communications, we introduce two metrics, namely molecule delay and multi-path spread. We show that these metrics link the VN structure to molecule dispersion induced by the VN and mediately to the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the RX. The proposed VN structure-SNR link is validated experimentally, demonstrating that the proposed framework can support tasks such as optimal sensor placement in the CVS or the identification of suitable testbed topologies for specific SNR requirements. All experimental data are openly available on Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving and reward-based mechanisms of proof of engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proof-of-Attendance (PoA) mechanisms are typically employed to demonstrate a specific user's participation in an event, whether virtual or in-person. The goal of this study is to extend such mechanisms to broader contexts where the user wishes to digitally demonstrate her involvement in a specific activity (Proof-of-Engagement, PoE). This work explores different solutions, including DLTs as well as established technologies based on centralized systems. The main aspects we consider include the level of privacy guaranteed to users, the scope of PoA/PoE (both temporal and spatial), the transferability of the proof, and the integration with incentive mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Keeping Medical AI Healthy and Trustworthy: A Review of Detection and Correction Methods for System Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality. These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the "health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.</description>
