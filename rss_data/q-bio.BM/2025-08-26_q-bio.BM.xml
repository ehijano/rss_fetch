      <title>From Prediction to Simulation: AlphaFold 3 as a Differentiable Framework for Structural Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlphaFold 3 represents a transformative advancement in computational biology, enhancing protein structure prediction through novel multi-scale transformer architectures, biologically informed cross-attention mechanisms, and geometry-aware optimization strategies. These innovations dramatically improve predictive accuracy and generalization across diverse protein families, surpassing previous methods. Crucially, AlphaFold 3 embodies a paradigm shift toward differentiable simulation, bridging traditional static structural modeling with dynamic molecular simulations. By reframing protein folding predictions as a differentiable process, AlphaFold 3 serves as a foundational framework for integrating deep learning with physics-based molecular</description>

      <title>Disordered But Rhythmic: the role of intrinsic protein disorder in eukaryotic circadian timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are found across all domains of life and are characterized by a lack of stable 3D structure. Nevertheless, IDRs play critical roles in the most tightly regulated cellular processes, including in the core circadian clock. The molecular oscillator at the heart of circadian regulation leverages IDRs as dynamic interaction modules for activation and repression to support robust timekeeping and expand clock output and regulation. Here, we cover the biophysical mechanisms conferred by IDRs and their modulators. We survey the intrinsically disordered regions in clock proteins that are widely prevalent from fungi to mammals and discuss the importance of IDRs to the core clock and beyond.</description>

      <title>In-vitro Anti-bacterial Activity of Methanol and Aqueous Crude Extracts of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: Over the past two decades, the rise of multidrug resistance (MDR) in bacteria has posed a significant threat to global health. The urgent need for new treatment alternatives has brought attention to the potential of plants, which harbor a wealth of unexplored phytochemicals with therapeutic properties. This study aims to evaluate the anti-bacterial efficacy of methanol and aqueous extracts from the leaves and bark of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi In vitro. Methodology: Aqueous and methanol extracts were obtained from the cold maceration method. In vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanol and aqueous leaf, bark, and combination extracts were determined against gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923). The anti-bacterial assay for different concentrations of each extract was conducted through the well-diffusion method, with Gentamycin serving as the positive control. Results: Methanol leaf and combination extracts of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi have shown a positive anti-bacterial response at their highest concentrations of 1000mcg/mL and 500mcg/mL against grampositive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus while none of the extracts showed anti-bacterial activity against gram-negative E. coli at the experimented concentrations. Conclusion: The study concludes that methanol extracts of H.iryaghedhi should be further analyzed for their anti-bacterial activity, and there could be potential lead molecules that can be developed as antibiotics</description>

      <title>Evaluation of in vitro antibacterial activity and phytochemical profile of aqueous leaf extract of Asystasia variabilis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluated the in vitro antibacterial effect and the phytochemical profile of aqueous extract of fresh mature leaves of Asystasia variabilis, a Sri Lankan indigenous plant, against four common wound infective bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test. Gentamicin 10 {\mu}g/ disk and distilled water was used as positive and negative controls respectively The study revealed, for the first time, that the extract possessed significant antibacterial activity against all four test organisms in a concentration dependent manner (r values ranging from 0.921-0.992, P&lt;0.01) with inhibition zone diameters ranging between 8 and 28 mm. Highest antibacterial activity was exhibited against B. subtilis at 1000 {\mu}g/ disk (27.43-+0.02 mm). The extract showed inhibitory effects comparable to gentamicin towards B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa at 500 {\mu}g/ disk and towards E. coli and S. aureus at 1000 {\mu}g/ disk. Qualitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids, tannins, phenols, cardiac glycosides, amino acids, carbohydrates, alkaloids and saponins. Therefore it is likely that the antibacterial effect of the extract is mediated by synergistic mechanisms. Furthermore, results of this study scientifically justified the claim traditional and folk medicine in the treatment of abscesses, wounds and ulcers and indicated the potential for the development of a novel drug from mature leaves of Asystasia variabilis.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Based Molecular Graph Generation with Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in computational chemistry have increasingly focused on synthesizing molecules based on textual instructions. Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus. Our code is availble at https://github.com/ran1812/UTGDiff.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high dose rate 6 MeV electron irradiation generates stable [1-$^{13}$C]alanine radicals suitable for medical imaging with dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (dDNP) increases the sensitivity of magnetic resonance experiments by &gt;10^4-fold, permitting isotopically-labelled molecules to be transiently visible in MRI scans. dDNP mechanistically takes place at ~1K, and requires unpaired electrons and microwaves. These electrons are usually chemical radicals, requiring removal by filtration prior to injection into humans. Alternative sources, such as UV irradiation, generate lower polarisation and require cryogenic transport. We present ultra-high-dose-rate electron irradiation as a novel alternative for generating non-persistent radicals in alanine/glycerol mixtures. These are stable for months at room temperature, quench spontaneously upon dissolution, are present in dose-dependent concentrations, and generate comparable nuclear polarisation (17%) to trityl radicals used clinically (19%) through a novel mechanism we believe to involve partial ordering, and electron-electron interactions. Owing to the large radiation doses required, this process is sterilising, permits imaging of alanine metabolism in vivo in the rat kidney, and may aid clinically translating dDNP.</description>
