      <title>Decoding the dark proteome: Deep learning-enabled discovery of druggable enzymes in Wuchereria bancrofti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage drug development for the species.</description>

      <title>Non-Kramers State Transitions in a Synthetic Toggle Switch Biosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State transitions are fundamental in biological systems but challenging to observe directly. Here, we present the first single-cell observation of state transitions in a synthetic bacterial genetic circuit. Using a mother machine, we tracked over 1007 cells for 27 hours. First-passage analysis and dynamical reconstruction reveal that transitions occur outside the small-noise regime, challenging the applicability of classical Kramers' theory. The process lacks a single characteristic rate, questioning the paradigm of transitions between discrete cell states. We observe significant multiplicative noise that distorts the effective potential landscape yet increases transition times. These findings necessitate theoretical frameworks for biological state transitions beyond the small-noise assumption.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometric recipes for periodic oscillations in reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oscillatory chemical reactions are functional components in a variety of biological contexts. In chemistry, the construction and identification of even rudimentary oscillators remain elusive and lack a general framework. Using parameter-rich kinetics - a methodology enabling the disentanglement of parametric dependencies from structural analysis - we investigate the stoichiometry of chemical oscillators. We introduce the concept of oscillatory cores: minimal subnetworks that guarantee the potential for oscillations in any reaction network containing them. These cores fall into two classes, depending on whether they involve positive or negative feedback. In particular, the latter class unveils a family of oscillators - yet to be synthesized - that require a minimum number of reaction steps to exhibit oscillations, a phenomenon we refer to as the principle of length. We identify several mechanisms through which catalysis promotes oscillations: (I) furnishing instability (e.g. autocatalysis), (II) lifting dependencies, (III) lowering length thresholds. Notwithstanding this mechanistic ubiquity, we show that oscillators can also be realized without employing any catalysis. Our results highlight branches of chemistry where oscillators are likely to arise by chance, suggest new strategies for their design, and point to novel classes of oscillators yet to be realized experimentally.</description>
