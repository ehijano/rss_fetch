      <title>Wheeler Bisimulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new paradigm was introduced in automata theory. The main idea is to classify regular languages according to their propensity to be sorted, establishing a deep connection between automata theory and data compression [J. ACM 2023]. This parameterization leads to two hierarchies of regular languages: a deterministic hierarchy and a non-deterministic hierarchy. While the deterministic hierarchy is well understood, the non-deterministic hierarchy appears much more complex. This is true even for the richest and most studied level of the hierarchies, corresponding to the class of Wheeler languages.
  In this paper, we study Wheeler language through the lens of bisimulations. We first show that the standard notion of bisimulation is not appropriate. Then, we introduce Wheeler bisimulations, that is, bisimulations that respect the convex structure of the considered Wheeler automata. Although there are some differences between the properties of bisimulations and the properties of Wheeler bisimulations, we show that Wheeler bisimulations induce a unique minimal Wheeler NFA (analogously to standard bisimulations). In particular, in the deterministic case, we retrieve the minimum Wheeler deterministic automaton of a given language. We also show that the minimal Wheeler NFA induced by Wheeler bisimulations can be built in linear time. This is in contrast with standard bisimulations, for which the corresponding minimal NFA can be built in $ O(m \log n) $ time (where $ m $ is the number of edges and $ n $ is the number of states) by adapting Paige-Tarjan's partition refinement algorithm.</description>

      <title>Computing the Reachability Value of Posterior-Deterministic POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a fundamental model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.
  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.
  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated.</description>

      <title>An Automata-Based Approach to Games with $\omega$-Automatic Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies multiplayer turn-based games on graphs in which player preferences are modeled as $\omega$-automatic relations given by deterministic parity automata. This contrasts with most existing work, which focuses on specific reward functions. We conduct a computational analysis of these games, starting with the threshold problem in the antagonistic zero-sum case. As in classical games, we introduce the concept of value, defined here as the set of plays a player can guarantee to improve upon, relative to their preference relation. We show that this set is recognized by an alternating parity automaton APW of polynomial size. We also establish the computational complexity of several problems related to the concepts of value and optimal strategy, taking advantage of the $\omega$-automatic characterization of value. Next, we shift to multiplayer games and Nash equilibria, and revisit the threshold problem in this context. Based on an APW construction again, we close complexity gaps left open in the literature, and additionally show that cooperative rational synthesis is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete, while it becomes undecidable in the non-cooperative case.</description>

      <title>Formal Foundations for Controlled Stochastic Activity Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Controlled Stochastic Activity Networks (Controlled SANs), a formal extension of classical Stochastic Activity Networks that integrates explicit control actions into a unified semantic framework for modeling distributed real-time systems. Controlled SANs systematically capture dynamic behavior involving nondeterminism, probabilistic branching, and stochastic timing, while enabling policy-driven decision-making within a rigorous mathematical framework.
  We develop a hierarchical, automata-theoretic semantics for Controlled SANs that encompasses nondeterministic, probabilistic, and stochastic models in a uniform manner. A structured taxonomy of control policies, ranging from memoryless and finite-memory strategies to computationally augmented policies, is formalized, and their expressive power is characterized through associated language classes. To support model abstraction and compositional reasoning, we introduce behavioral equivalences, including bisimulation and stochastic isomorphism.
  Controlled SANs generalize classical frameworks such as continuous-time Markov decision processes (CTMDPs), providing a rigorous foundation for the specification, verification, and synthesis of dependable systems operating under uncertainty. This framework enables both quantitative and qualitative analysis, advancing the design of safety-critical systems where control, timing, and stochasticity are tightly coupled.</description>

      <title>Profinite trees, through Lawvere theories and the lambda-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The starting point of algebraic language theory is that regular languages of finite words are exactly those recognized by finite monoids. This finiteness condition gives rise to a topological space whose points, called profinite words, encode the limiting behavior of words with respect to finite monoids.
  In this work, we move from words and monoids to trees and clones, the algebraic structures underlying deterministic bottom-up tree automata. Using the categorical notion of codensity monad, we introduce a profinite completion for clones. We prove that this construction on clones simultaneously generalizes the ultrafilter monad on sets and the profinite completion of monoids. When applied to free clones on a ranked alphabet, the profinite completion of clones yields a notion of profinite tree, providing a topological approach to regular languages of finite trees. We prove that these profinite trees coincide with a well-identified fragment of the profinite lambda-calculus.</description>
