      <title>Linear Hashing with $\ell_\infty$ guarantees and two-sided Kakeya bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01665v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a randomly chosen linear map over a finite field gives a good hash function in the $\ell_\infty$ sense. More concretely, consider a set $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^n$ and a randomly chosen linear map $L : \mathbb{F}_q^n \to \mathbb{F}_q^t$ with $q^t$ taken to be sufficiently smaller than $ |S|$. Let $U_S$ denote a random variable distributed uniformly on $S$. Our main theorem shows that, with high probability over the choice of $L$, the random variable $L(U_S)$ is close to uniform in the $\ell_\infty$ norm. In other words, {\em every} element in the range $\mathbb{F}_q^t$ has about the same number of elements in $S$ mapped to it. This complements the widely-used Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) which proves the analog statement under the statistical, or $\ell_1$, distance (for a richer class of functions) as well as prior work on the expected largest 'bucket size' in linear hash functions [ADMPT99]. By known bounds from the load balancing literature [RS98], our results are tight and show that linear functions hash as well as trully random function up to a constant factor in the entropy loss. Our proof leverages a connection between linear hashing and the finite field Kakeya problem and extends some of the tools developed in this area, in particular the polynomial method.</description>

      <title>Balanced Substructures in Bicolored Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph is said to be balanced if it has an equal number of edges of each color. Given a graph $G$ whose edges are colored using two colors and a positive integer $k$, the objective in the Edge Balanced Connected Subgraph problem is to determine if $G$ has a balanced connected subgraph containing at least $k$ edges. We first show that this problem is NP-complete and remains so even if the solution is required to be a tree or a path. Then, we focus on the parameterized complexity of Edge Balanced Connected Subgraph and its variants (where the balanced subgraph is required to be a path/tree) with respect to $k$ as the parameter. Towards this, we show that if a graph has a balanced connected subgraph/tree/path of size at least $k$, then it has one of size at least $k$ and at most $f(k)$ where $f$ is a linear function. We use this result combined with dynamic programming algorithms based on color coding and representative sets to show that Edge Balanced Connected Subgraph and its variants are FPT. Further, using polynomial-time reductions to the Multilinear Monomial Detection problem, we give faster randomized FPT algorithms for the problems. In order to describe these reductions, we define a combinatorial object called relaxed-subgraph. We define this object in such a way that balanced connected subgraphs, trees and paths are relaxed-subgraphs with certain properties. This object is defined in the spirit of branching walks known for the Steiner Tree problem and may be of independent interest.</description>
