      <title>Reducing Cartel Violence: The Mexican Dilemma Between Social and Security Spending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organised crime in Mexico threatens societal stability and public safety, driving pervasive violence and economic disruption. Despite security investments and social programs designed in part to reduce involvement in crime, cartel power and violence continue to persist. This study evaluates existing policies and introduces a novel framework using optimal control theory to analyse cartel dynamics. Specifically, by modelling resource allocation between security measures and social programs, we identify optimal strategies to mitigate the impacts of cartels. Findings reveal that Mexico's largest cartel imposes an annual economic burden exceeding \text{US\$ } 19 billion, 2.5 times the government's investment in science and technology. We further demonstrate that current budget allocations between social and security programs are nearly optimal yet insufficient to reduce cartel violence significantly. In light of these findings, we demonstrate that achieving meaningful harm reduction would require a significantly larger budget and would take over a decade, even with increased funding.</description>

      <title>Do Streetscapes Still Matter for Customer Ratings of Eating and Drinking Establishments in Car-Dependent Cities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how indoor and outdoor aesthetics, streetscapes, and neighborhood features shape customer satisfaction at eating and dining establishments (EDEs) across different urban contexts, varying in car dependency, in Washington, DC. Using review photos and street view images, computer vision models quantified perceived safety and visual appeal. Ordinal logistic regression analyzed their effects on Yelp ratings. Findings reveal that both indoor and outdoor environments significantly impact EDE ratings, while streetscape quality's influence diminishes in car-dependent areas. The study highlights the need for context-sensitive planning that integrates indoor and outdoor factors to enhance customer experiences in diverse settings.</description>

      <title>Citation Issues in Wave Mechanics Theory of Microwave Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wave mechanics theory of microwave absorption challenges the long-standing impedance-matching and quarter-wavelength paradigms by demonstrating that conventional models mistakenly conflate bulk material parameters with thin-film phenomena. Drawing on a corpus of 35 peer-reviewed papers and preprints, the study performs a citation-pattern analysis and a logical audit of established theory. Results reveal a striking asymmetry in scholarly engagement, only a handful of supportive or neutral citations appear amid widespread silence, alongside critical logical flaws in impedance matching, notably its inconsistent treatment of penetration, reflection, and absorption from film. By re-framing absorption as a wave-mechanics process governed by interference at parallel interfaces, the wave mechanics framework restores energy-conservation consistency and provides experimentally verified design rules for film thickness, phase response, and broadband performance. The paper further situates the citation neglect within broader issues of peer-review bias and paradigm inertia, illustrating how cargo-cult scientific practices can impede theoretical progress. Recommendations are offered for researchers, editors, and institutions to foster open discourse, rigorously test competing models, and update curricula and design tools accordingly.</description>

      <title>Decision making in heterogeneous self-propelled particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the role of uninformed individuals in consensus formation within opinion-swarming models for self-propelled particles. The proposed models are inspired by empirical observations in animal swarming, particularly in schooling fish. We propose a coupled model that integrates spatial swarming dynamics with the evolution of individual opinions. Each individual is therefore described by its position, velocity, and a continuous opinion variable; it interacts through self-propulsion, alignment, attraction-repulsion forces, and opinion-based mechanisms. Building on classical bounded-confidence models, we introduce a three-population framework that distinguishes between leaders, followers, and uninformed individuals. Our analysis reveals that uninformed individuals, despite lacking any opinion bias, significantly influence group dynamics by diluting the effect of leaders and promoting more democratic decision-making. Numerical simulations demonstrate a variety of emergent behaviours, including flocking and milling. These findings support the role of uninformed agents in collective decision making and provide first analytical insights to understand leadership and opinion consensus in heterogeneous crowds.</description>

      <title>Limiting risk to reduce inequality: insights from the Yard-Sale model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wealth inequality remains a critical socioeconomic challenge, driven by systemic dynamics and self-reinforcing mechanisms that amplify the economic imbalances. Simplified models from statistical physics provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing wealth distribution. In this study, we extend the Yard-Sale model -- a minimal kinetic exchange framework -- to investigate how limiting risk in economic transactions affects inequality. While previous research demonstrates that such models naturally lead to wealth concentration, we introduce a mechanism that restricts the maximum risk agents can assume during exchanges. Numerical simulations reveal that this modification fosters more equitable wealth distributions and significantly reduces extreme disparities. These findings highlight the importance of individual-level constraints in shaping systemic outcomes, offering new perspectives on promoting economic balance.</description>

      <title>Wealth Inequality in Agent-Based Economies: The Dominant Role of Social Protection over Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent wealth inequality, where a small fraction of the population accumulates most resources while the majority remains economically vulnerable, is a widespread phenomenon. We investigate its underlying mechanisms using an agent-based Yard-Sale model that incorporates two complementary features: transaction rules that favor poorer agents, representing social protection policies, and an economic growth process with explicit wealth redistribution. Our results reveal that social protection plays a dominant role in reducing inequality, while redistribution primarily serves to reintegrate excluded agents. These findings suggest that social protection policies, that is, targeted mechanisms favoring economically vulnerable agents, may have a substantially greater impact on reducing inequality than redistribution driven solely by economic growth. We also find that both the shape of the wealth distributions and the resulting inequality levels are strongly influenced by the underlying distribution of individual risk, highlighting the importance of considering agent heterogeneity when modeling economic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling revolutions in networked societies: learning from the Tunisian spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic competition and deregulation have led to a polarization of societies between a small, increasingly powerful elite and a majority of socially excluded individuals, marginalized and unconnected to political representations. This is the breeding ground for protest movements, relayed by local ties and amplified by social networks. Based on the characteristics revealed by socio-economic research into the Arab revolutions of the 2010s, this article proposes a formalization inspired by the theory of complex systems. We discuss the conditions under which an initial localized event - for example, the suicide of a street vendor condemned to ruin in a small Tunisian town - can trigger an explosion of the number of opponents to the regime, typical of a revolutionary episode. We consider a network model of agents and oppressors where pair interactions are controlled by a fear parameter, or the inclination of the individuals to rebel despite of repression. The model exhibits a phase transition at a critical threshold above which the quiescent state becomes unstable. Furthermore, the ability of individuals to forge triadic relationships accelerates the process of joining a rising rebellion, making the transition more abrupt, in the form of a brutal discontinuity that can be described as revolutionary. The imposition of a counter-revolution by the hardening of repression can be explained by the hysteresis property displayed by the model: when mobilization has extended the initial network and made it partially permanent, repression by the authorities must be tightened to higher levels than before to regain control.</description>

      <title>Inter-role reciprocity in evolutionary trust game on square lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating bipartite games, such as the trust game, is not straightforward due to the lack of a natural way to distinguish roles in a single population. The square lattice topology can provide a simple yet elegant solution by alternating trustors and trustees. For even lattice sizes, it creates two disjoint diagonal sub-lattices for strategy learning, while game interactions can take place on the original lattice. This setup ensures a minimal spatial structure that allows interactions across roles and learning within roles. By simulations on this setup, we detect an inter-role spatial reciprocity mechanism, through which trust can emerge. In particular, a moderate return ratio allows investing trustors and trustworthy trustees to form inter-role clusters and thus save trust. If the return is too high, it harms the survival of trustees; if too low, it harms trustors. The proposed simulation framework is also applicable to any bipartite game to uncover potential inter-role spatial mechanisms across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Semi-Markov random walk on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-Markov model of random walk on complex networks in discrete and continuous-time scenario. In the general setting of the semi-Markov chains, the duration of stay at given node - the sojourn time - is random, and the probability to transition to a neighbor depends on the sojourn time. Analytical formulae for the average sojourn time and the node occupation probability of infinite walk are presented and verified with Monte Carlo simulations for two examples. We propose an application of the semi-Markovian random walk for ranking web pages determined by the fraction of time that infinite random surfer spends on a web page - time rank, as an alternative to the existing PageRank that relies on the fraction of visits - visit rank.</description>

      <title>LLMs Capture Urban Science but Oversimplify Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in scientific reasoning and data generation tasks, yet their alignment with empirical knowledge and practical urban data in urban science remains unclear. Here, this study introduces AI4US (Artificial Intelligence for Urban Science), a framework for systematically evaluating five leading LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini, and ChatGLM) by generating urban data and testing their fidelity against real data distributions and the empirical results of three foundational theories, including urban scaling laws, urban distance decay, and urban vitality. LLMs reproduce core theoretical patterns with notable accuracy (average R2= 0.804 for scaling; 0.988 for decay), and exhibit capacity to simulate less formalized constructs such as urban vitality. However, generated data exhibit crucial limitations: poor diversity compared to real data; systematic deviations in fitted theoretical parameters (e.g., underestimated scaling exponents and decay rates); and limited improvement from prompt engineering. These findings suggest that while LLMs offer a promising research paradigm for exploring urban science, they fall short of capturing real-world complexity, underscoring the need for improved alignment and evaluation.</description>

      <title>What is emergence, after all?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>

      <title>Peer influence breaks ergodicity in an opinion dynamics model with external information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stochastic imitation-based model of opinion dynamics in which agents balance social conformity with responsiveness to an external signal. The model captures how populations evolve between two binary opinion states, driven by peer influence and noisy external information. Through both memory-less and memory-based implementations, we identify a critical threshold of social sensitivity that separates an ergodic phase--where agents collectively track the external signal--from a non-ergodic phase characterized by persistent consensus and reduced adaptability to external changes. Analytical results and simulations reveal that memory in decision-making smooths the transition and lowers the critical threshold for ergodicity breaking. Extending the model to various network structures confirms the robustness of the observed phase transition. We further discuss empirical methodologies for estimating the critical threshold and show how the model may be applied to real-world domains. Our findings contribute to understanding how social conformity, memory effects and randomness jointly shape collective behaviour, with implications for predicting social tipping points and influencing large-scale social dynamics.</description>

      <title>Organizations, teams, and job mobility: A social microdynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the modeling approaches used to understand organizational worker mobility are highly stylized, using idealizations such as structureless organizations, indistinguishable workers, and a lack of social bonding of the workers. In this article, aided by a decade of precise, temporally resolved data of a large civilian organization of the US Army in which employees can change jobs in a similar way to many private organizations, we introduce a new framework to describe organizations as composites of teams within which individuals perform specific tasks and where social connections develop. By tracking the personnel composition of organizational teams, we find that workers who change jobs are highly influenced by preferring to reunite with past coworkers. In this organization, 34% of all moves across temporally stable teams (and 32% of the totality of moves) lead to worker reunions, percentages that have not been reported and are well-above intuitive expectation. To assess the importance of worker reunions in determining job moves, we compare them to labor supply and demand with or without occupational specialization. The comparison shows that the most consistent information about job change is provided by reunions. We find that the greater the time workers spend together or the smaller the team they share both increase their likelihood to reunite, supporting the notion of increased familiarity and trust behind such reunions and the dominant role of social capital in the evolution of large organizations. Our study of this organization supports the idea that to correctly forecast job mobility inside large organizations, their teams structures and the social ties formed in those teams play a key role in shaping internal job change.</description>
