      <title>Benchmarking of quantum and classical SDP relaxations for QUBO formulations of real-world logistics problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBOs) are intensively discussed in the realm of quantum computing and polynomial optimization. We provide a vast experimental study of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of QUBOs using sums of squares methods and on Hamiltonian Updates. We test on QUBO reformulations of industry-based instances of the (open) vehicle routing problem and the (affinity-based) slotting problem -- two common combinatorial optimization problems in logistics. Beyond comparing the performance of various methods and software, our results reaffirm that optimizing over non-generic, real-world instances provides additional challenges. In consequence, this study underscores recent developments towards structure exploitation and specialized solver development for the used methods and simultaneously shows that further research is necessary in this direction both on the classical and the quantum side.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reachability Analysis for Convolutional Neural Networks Using Hybrid Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedforward neural networks are widely used in autonomous systems, particularly for control and perception tasks within the system loop. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks necessitates formal verification before deployment in safety-critical applications. Existing set propagation-based reachability analysis methods for feedforward neural networks often struggle to achieve both scalability and accuracy. This work presents a novel set-based approach for computing the reachable sets of convolutional neural networks. The proposed method leverages a hybrid zonotope representation and an efficient neural network reduction technique, providing a flexible trade-off between computational complexity and approximation accuracy. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Programming Algorithms for Finding Cost-Optimal Trajectory on the Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of finding the optimal trajectory of a road on a given terrain, taking into account the presence of elevation changes. Unlike the heuristic methods often used to solve such problems we present an approach that reduces the problem to a calculus of variations problem by introducing an integral cost functional. We prove the existence of an optimum of the functional. The optimal trajectory that minimizes the specified functional is sought using the dynamic programming method. We also thoroughly study the discretization issue and demonstrate the implementation of Bellman's optimality principle. In addition, we prove the convergence theorem of the proposed algorithm and provide a computational complexity analysis as well as numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Strong Duality, Hidden Convexity, and Gradient Dominance in the Linear Quadratic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is a cornerstone of optimal control theory, widely studied in both model-based and model-free approaches. Despite its well-established nature, certain foundational aspects remain subtle. In this paper, we revisit three key properties of policy optimization in LQR: (i) strong duality in the nonconvex policy optimization formulation, (ii) the gradient dominance property, examining when it holds and when it fails, and (iii) the global optimality of linear static policies. Using primal-dual analysis and convex reformulation, we refine and clarify existing results by leveraging Riccati equations/inequalities, semidefinite programming (SDP) duality, and a recent framework of Extended Convex Lifting (\texttt{ECL}). Our analysis confirms that LQR 1) behaves almost like a convex problem (e.g., strong duality) under the standard assumptions of stabilizability and detectability and 2) exhibits strong convexity-like properties (e.g., gradient dominance) under slightly stronger conditions. In particular, we establish a broader characterization under which gradient dominance holds using \texttt{ECL} and the notion of Cauchy directions. By clarifying and refining these theoretical insights, we hope this work contributes to a deeper understanding of LQR and may inspire further developments beyond LQR.</description>

      <title>Online Learning-Based Predictive Control for Nonlinear System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an online learning-based predictive control (LPC) approach designed for nonlinear systems that lack explicit system dynamics. Unlike traditional model predictive control (MPC) algorithms that rely on known system models to optimize controller outputs, our proposed algorithm integrates a reinforcement learning component to learn optimal policies in real time from the offline dataset and real-time data. Additionally, an optimal control problem (OCP)-based optimization framework is incorporated to enhance real-time computational efficiency while ensuring stability during online operation. Moreover, we rigorously establish the super-linear convergence properties of the algorithm. Finally, extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Non-Parametric Model Learning and Adaptive Control of MDPs with Borel spaces: Identifiability and Near Optimal Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an average cost stochastic control problem with standard Borel spaces and an unknown transition kernel. We do not assume a parametric structure on the unknown kernel. We present topologies on kernels which lead to their identifiability and ensures near optimality through robustness to identifiability errors. Following this, we present two data-driven identifiability results; the first one being Bayesian (with finite time convergence guarantees) and the second one empirical (with asymptotic convergence guarantees). The identifiability results are, then, used to design near-optimal adaptive control policies which alternate between periods of exploration, where the agent attempts to learn the true kernel, and periods of exploitation where the knowledge accrued throughout the exploration phase is used to minimize costs. We will establish that such policies are near optimal. Moreover, we will show that near optimality can also be achieved through policies that simultaneously explore and exploit the environment. Thus, our primary contributions are to present very general conditions ensuring identifiability, as well as adaptive learning and control which leads to optimality. Key tools facilitating our analysis are a general measurability theorem, robustness to model learning, and continuity of expected average cost in stationary policies under Young topology.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of EXTRA in Non-convex Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems involving the minimization of a finite sum of smooth, possibly non-convex functions arise in numerous applications. To achieve a consensus solution over a network, distributed optimization algorithms, such as \textbf{EXTRA} (decentralized exact first-order algorithm), have been proposed to address these challenges. In this paper, we analyze the convergence properties of \textbf{EXTRA} in the context of smooth, non-convex optimization. By interpreting its updates as a nonlinear dynamical system, we show novel insights into its convergence properties. Specifically, i) \textbf{EXTRA} converges to a consensual first-order stationary point of the global objective with a sublinear rate; and ii) \textbf{EXTRA} avoids convergence to consensual strict saddle points, offering second-order guarantees that ensure robustness. These findings provide a deeper understanding of \textbf{EXTRA} in a non-convex context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of boundary delay equations, establishing a unified framework for analyzing systems with time-delayed boundary conditions. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions. Furthermore, we derive spectral conditions for exponential stability, applicable to a broad class of perturbed boundary value problems. The conditions on the perturbations generalize well-known criteria for the generation of domain perturbations of positive semigroups generators. As an application, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of positive linear hyperbolic systems with time-delayed boundary conditions, demonstrating the practical relevance of our findings.</description>

      <title>Multi-constraint Graph Partitioning Problems Via Recursive Bipartition Algorithm Based on Subspace Minimization Conjugate Gradient Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph partitioning problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. In this paper, we formulate a 0-1 quadratic integer programming model for the graph partitioning problem with vertex weight constraints and fixed vertex constraints, and propose a recursive bipartition algorithm based on the subspace minimization conjugate gradient method. To alleviate the difficulty of solving the model, the constrained problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem using equilibrium terms, elimination methods, and trigonometric properties, and solved via an accelerated subspace minimization conjugate gradient algorithm. Initial feasible partitions are generated using a hyperplane rounding algorithm, followed by heuristic refinement strategies, including one-neighborhood and two-interchange adjustments, to iteratively improve the results. Numerical experiments on knapsack-constrained graph partitioning and industrial examples demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A scalable sequential adaptive cubic regularization algorithm for optimization with general equality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalable adaptive cubic regularization method ($\mathrm{ARC_{q}K}$: Dussault et al. in Math. Program. Ser. A 207(1-2):191-225, 2024) has been recently proposed for unconstrained optimization. It has excellent convergence properties, complexity, and promising numerical performance. In this paper, we extend $\mathrm{ARC_{q}K}$ to large scale nonlinear optimization with general equality constraints and propose a scalable sequential adaptive cubic regularization algorithm named $\mathrm{SSARC_{q}K}$. In each iteration, we construct an ARC subproblem with linearized constraints inspired by sequential quadratic optimization methods. Then composite-step approach is used to decompose the trial step into the sum of the vertical step and the horizontal step. By means of reduced-Hessian approach, we rewrite the linearity constrained ARC subproblem as a standard unconstrained ARC subproblem to compute the horizontal step. A CG-Lanczos procedure with shifts is employed to solve this subproblem approximately. We provide a new global convergence analysis of the inexact ARC method. Preliminary numerical results are reported to show the performance of $\mathrm{SSARC_{q}K}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the small-time controllability problem on the Lie groups $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ and $SL_2(\mathbb{R})\ltimes H_{d}(\mathbb{R})$ with Lie bracket methods (here $H_{d}(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the $(2d+1)$-dimensional real Heisenberg group). Then, using unitary representations of $SL_2(\mathbb{R})\ltimes H_{d}(\mathbb{R})$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{C})$ and $L^p(T^*\mathbb{R}^d,\mathbb{R}), p\in[1,\infty)$, we recover small-time approximate reachability properties of the Schr\"odinger PDE for the quantum harmonic oscillator, and find new small-time approximate reachability properties of the Liouville PDE for the classical harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>A low-complexity funnel control approach for non-linear systems of higher-order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of output reference tracking for unknown non-linear multi-input, multi-output systems described by functional differential equations. This class of systems includes those with a strict relative degree, and bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable internal dynamics. The objective is to ensure that the tracking error evolves within a prescribed performance funnel. To achieve this, we propose a novel model-free adaptive controller with lower complexity than existing funnel control methods, avoiding the use of non-linearities in intermediate error signals. We establish the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design through theoretical analysis and demonstrate its performance with simulations, comparing it to previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Certified Inductive Synthesis for Online Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fields such as autonomous and safety-critical systems, online optimization plays a crucial role in control and decision-making processes, often requiring the integration of continuous and discrete variables. These tasks are frequently modeled as mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems, where feedback data are incorporated as parameters. However, solving MIPs within strict time constraints is challenging due to their $\mathcal{NP}$-complete nature. A promising solution to this challenge involves leveraging the largely invariant structure of these problems to perform most computations offline, thus enabling efficient online solving even on platforms with limited hardware capabilities. In this paper we present a novel implementation of this strategy that uses counterexample-guided inductive synthesis to split the MIP solution process into two stages. In the offline phase, we construct a mapping that provides feasible assignments for binary variables based on parameter values within a specified range. In the online phase, we solve the remaining continuous part of the problem by fixing the binary variables to the values predicted by this mapping. Our numerical evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and solution quality of this approach compared to standard mixed-integer solvers, highlighting its potential for real-time applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Scenario Reduction for Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic and (distributionally) robust optimization problems often become computationally challenging as the number of scenarios increases. Scenario reduction is therefore a key technique for improving tractability. We introduce a general scenario reduction method for distributionally robust optimization (DRO), which includes stochastic and robust optimization as special cases. Our approach constructs the reduced DRO problem by projecting the original ambiguity set onto a reduced set of scenarios. Under mild conditions, we establish bounds on the relative quality of the reduction. The methodology is applicable to random variables following either discrete or continuous probability distributions, with representative scenarios appropriately selected in both cases. Given the relevance of optimization problems with linear and quadratic objectives, we further refine our approach for these settings. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on mixed-integer benchmark instances from MIPLIB and portfolio optimization problems. Our results show that the proposed approximation significantly reduces solution time while maintaining high solution quality with only minor errors.</description>

      <title>Infinity-norm-based Input-to-State-Stable Long Short-Term Memory networks: a thermal systems perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown remarkable performances in system identification, particularly in nonlinear dynamical systems such as thermal processes. However, stability remains a critical challenge in practical applications: although the underlying process may be intrinsically stable, there may be no guarantee that the resulting RNN model captures this behavior. This paper addresses the stability issue by deriving a sufficient condition for Input-to-State Stability based on the infinity-norm (ISS$_{\infty}$) for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The obtained condition depends on fewer network parameters compared to prior works. A ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted training strategy is developed, incorporating a penalty term in the loss function that encourages stability and an ad hoc early stopping approach. The quality of LSTM models trained via the proposed approach is validated on a thermal system case study, where the ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted LSTM outperforms both a physics-based model and an ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network while also surpassing non-ISS$_{\infty}$-promoted LSTM and GRU RNNs.</description>

Abstract: We derive an explicit solution to the operator Riccati equation solving the Linear-Quadratic (LQ) optimal control problem for a class of boundary controlled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Different descriptions of the system are used to obtain different representations of the operator Riccati equation. By means of an example, we illustrate the importance of considering an extended operator Riccati equation to solve the LQ-optimal control problem for our class of systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of smooth asymptotically stable vector fields on $\R^n$, as well as the space of all proper smooth Lyapunov functions for such vector fields. We prove that both spaces are path-connected and simply connected when $n\neq 4,5$ and weakly contractible when $n\leq 3$. Moreover, both spaces have the weak homotopy type of a certain subset of the nonlinear Grassmannian of submanifolds of $\R^n$ diffeomorphic to the $n$-disc.
  The proofs rely on Lyapunov theory and differential topology, such as the work of Smale and Perelman on the generalized Poincar\'{e} conjecture and results of Smale, Cerf, and Hatcher on the topology of diffeomorphism groups of discs. Applications include a partial answer to a question of Conley, a parametric Hartman-Grobman theorem for nonyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria, and a parametric Morse lemma for degenerate minima. We also study the related topics of hyperbolic equilibria, Morse minima, and relative homotopy groups of the space of asymptotically stable vector fields inside the space of those vanishing at a single point.</description>

      <title>Processes on Wasserstein spaces and energy-minimizing particle representations in fractional Sobolev spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a probability-measure-valued process $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide almost surely with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy in expectation. Building on our recent study (arXiv:2502.12068), where the minimization of fractional Sobolev energy was investigated for deterministic paths on Wasserstein spaces, we now extend the results to the stochastic setting to address some applications that originally motivated our study. Two applications are given. We construct minimizing particle representations for processes on Wasserstein spaces on $\mathbb{R}$ with H\"{o}lder regularity, using optimal transportation. We prove the existence of minimizing particle representations for solutions to stochastic Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations on $\mathbb{R}^\mathrm{d}$ satisfying an integrability condition, using the stochastic superposition principle of Lacker--Shkolnikov--Zhang (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 25, 3229--3288 (2023)).</description>

      <title>A High-Speed Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation Strategy via a Two-layer Planning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), manipulators, and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of Non-Linear Programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. To address these hurdles, this paper proposes a two-layer optimization algorithm for 2D vehicles by dynamically reformulating small time horizon convex programming subproblems, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets identified by our customized search algorithms incrementally. The key benefits of our proposed algorithm include fast computation speeds and lower task time. We demonstrate these advantages through mathematical proofs under some moderate preconditions and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Robust upper estimates for topological entropy via nonlinear constrained optimization over adapted metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical-numerical method providing robust upper estimates for the topological entropy or, more generally, uniform volume growth exponents of differentiable mappings. By introducing varying metrics, we simplify the analysis at the cost of generally rougher bounds, but keeping the prospect of choosing more relatable metrics to refine the estimates. With any covering of an invariant set by a finite number of cubes, we associate a graph describing overlaps (edges) of the cubes (vertices) under iterates of the mapping. Weighing vertices according to a given metric, we reduce the problem to finding simple cycles with maximal relative weights. Then we develop an algorithm concerned with iterative resolving nonlinear programming problems for optimization of maximal relative weights in general smooth families of metrics which may involve interpolation or neural networks models. We describe applications of the algorithm to compute the largest uniform Lyapunov exponent and uniform Lyapunov dimension for the H\'{e}non and Rabinovich systems justifying the Eden conjecture at stationary and periodic points respectively.</description>

      <title>Ergodic exploration of dynamic distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research addresses the challenge of performing search missions in dynamic environments, particularly for drifting targets whose movement is dictated by a flow field. This is accomplished through a dynamical system that integrates two partial differential equations: one governing the dynamics and uncertainty of the probability distribution, and the other regulating the potential field for ergodic multi-agent search. The target probability field evolves in response to the target dynamics imposed by the environment and accomplished sensing efforts, while being explored by multiple robot agents guided by the potential field gradient. The proposed methodology was tested on two simulated search scenarios, one of which features a synthetically generated domain and showcases better performance when compared to the baseline method with static target probability over a range of agent to flow field velocity ratios. The second search scenario represents a realistic sea search and rescue mission where the search start is delayed, the search is performed in multiple robot flight missions, and the procedure for target drift uncertainty compensation is demonstrated. Furthermore, the proposed method provides an accurate survey completion metric, based on the known detection/sensing parameters, that correlates with the actual number of targets found independently.</description>

      <title>Underdamped Particle Swarm Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents Underdamped Particle Swarm Optimization (UEPS), a novel metaheuristic inspired by both the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and the dynamic behavior of an underdamped system. The underdamped motion acts as an intermediate solution between undamped systems, which oscillate indefinitely, and overdamped systems, which stabilize without oscillation. In the context of optimization, this type of motion allows particles to explore the search space dynamically, alternating between exploration and exploitation, with the ability to overshoot the optimal solution to explore new regions and avoid getting trapped in local optima.
  First, we review the concept of damped vibrations, an essential physical principle that describes how a system oscillates while losing energy over time, behaving in an underdamped, overdamped, or critically damped manner. This understanding forms the foundation for applying these concepts to optimization, ensuring a balanced management of exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, the classical PSO algorithm is discussed, highlighting its fundamental features and limitations, providing the necessary context to understand how the underdamped behavior improves PSO performance.
  The proposed metaheuristic is evaluated using benchmark functions and classic engineering problems, demonstrating its high robustness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>From Denoising Score Matching to Langevin Sampling: A Fine-Grained Error Analysis in the Gaussian Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from an unknown distribution, accessible only through discrete samples, is a fundamental problem at the core of generative AI. The current state-of-the-art methods follow a two-step process: first estimating the score function (the gradient of a smoothed log-distribution) and then applying a gradient-based sampling algorithm. The resulting distribution's correctness can be impacted by several factors: the generalization error due to a finite number of initial samples, the error in score matching, and the diffusion error introduced by the sampling algorithm. In this paper, we analyze the sampling process in a simple yet representative setting-sampling from Gaussian distributions using a Langevin diffusion sampler. We provide a sharp analysis of the Wasserstein sampling error that arises from the multiple sources of error throughout the pipeline. This allows us to rigorously track how the anisotropy of the data distribution (encoded by its power spectrum) interacts with key parameters of the end-to-end sampling method, including the noise amplitude, the step sizes in both score matching and diffusion, and the number of initial samples. Notably, we show that the Wasserstein sampling error can be expressed as a kernel-type norm of the data power spectrum, where the specific kernel depends on the method parameters. This result provides a foundation for further analysis of the tradeoffs involved in optimizing sampling accuracy, such as adapting the noise amplitude to the choice of step sizes.</description>

Abstract: We design nonlinear and adaptive linear model-predictive control (MPC) techniques to minimize operational costs of compressor-actuated dynamics in natural gas pipeline networks. We establish stability of the local linear system and derive rigorous bounds on error between the nonlinear and linear system solutions. These bounds are used to quantify conditions under which the linear MPC can substitute the nonlinear MPC without significant loss of predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we prove and numerically verify that the computational cost of the linear MPC is orders of magnitude lower than that of solving the baseline optimal control problem. Numerical simulations are performed on nontrivial networks to demonstrate that the proposed MPC can effectively adapt to varying load conditions while maintaining nearly 95% optimality.</description>

      <title>High Probability Guarantees for Random Reshuffling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic gradient method with random reshuffling ($\mathsf{RR}$) for tackling smooth nonconvex optimization problems. $\mathsf{RR}$ finds broad applications in practice, notably in training neural networks. In this work, we provide high probability first-order and second-order complexity guarantees for this method. First, we establish a high probability first-order sample complexity result for driving the Euclidean norm of the gradient (without taking expectation) below $\varepsilon$. Our derived complexity matches the best existing in-expectation one up to a logarithmic term while imposing no additional assumptions nor changing $\mathsf{RR}$'s updating rule. We then propose a simple and computable stopping criterion for $\mathsf{RR}$ (denoted as $\mathsf{RR}$-$\mathsf{sc}$). This criterion is guaranteed to be triggered after a finite number of iterations, enabling us to prove a high probability first-order complexity guarantee for the last iterate. Second, building on the proposed stopping criterion, we design a perturbed random reshuffling method ($\mathsf{p}$-$\mathsf{RR}$) that involves an additional randomized perturbation procedure near stationary points. We derive that $\mathsf{p}$-$\mathsf{RR}$ provably escapes strict saddle points and establish a high probability second-order complexity result, without requiring any sub-Gaussian tail-type assumptions on the stochastic gradient errors. The fundamental ingredient in deriving the aforementioned results is the new concentration property for sampling without replacement in $\mathsf{RR}$, which could be of independent interest. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on neural network training to support our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider bound-constrained mixed-integer optimization problems where the objective function is differentiable w.r.t.\ the continuous variables for every configuration of the integer variables. We mainly suggest to exploit derivative information when possible in these scenarios: concretely, we propose an algorithmic framework that carries out local optimization steps, alternating searches along gradient-based and primitive directions. The algorithm is shown to match the convergence properties of a derivative-free counterpart. Most importantly, the results of thorough computational experiments show that the proposed method clearly outperforms not only the derivative-free approach but also the main alternatives available from the literature to be used in the considered setting, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with a Tikhonov regularized second-order plus first-order primal-dual dynamical system with time scaling for separable convex optimization problems with linear equality constraints. This system consists of two second-order ordinary differential equations for the primal variables and one first-order ordinary differential equation for the dual variable.By utilizing the Lyapunov analysis approach, we obtain the convergence properties of the primal-dual gap, the objective function error, the feasibility measure and the gradient norm of the objective function along the trajectory. We also establish the strong convergence of the primal trajectory generated by the dynamical system towards the minimal norm solution of the separable convex optimization problem. Furthermore, we give numerical experiments to illustrate the theoretical results, showing that our dynamical system performs better than those in the literature in terms of convergence rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an optimal control algorithm for robust quantum gate preparation in open environments with the state of the quantum system represented using the Lindblad master equation. The algorithm is based on adaptive linearization and iterative quadratic programming to progressively shape the control signal into an optimal form. Robustness is achieved with exponential rates of convergence by introducing uncertain parameters into the master equation and expanding the parameterized state over the basis of Legendre polynomials. We prove that the proposed control algorithm reduces to GRadient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) when the robustness portion of the algorithm is bypassed and signal restrictions are relaxed. The control algorithm is applied to prepare Controlled NOT and SWAP gates with high precision. Using only second order Legendre polynomials, the examples showcase unprecedented robustness to 100% parameter uncertainty in the interaction strength between the qubits, while simultaneously compensating for 20% uncertainty in signal intensity. The results could enable new capabilities for robust implementation of quantum gates and circuits subject to harsh environments and hardware limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) are at least as ubiquitous as systems that are by nature finite-dimensional and modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). And yet, systematic and readily usable methodologies, for such a significant portion of real systems, have been historically scarce. Around the year 2000, the backstepping approach to PDE control began to offer not only a less abstract alternative to PDE control techniques replicating optimal and spectrum assignment techniques of the 1960s, but also enabled the methodologies of adaptive and nonlinear control, matured in the 1980s and 1990s, to be extended from ODEs to PDEs, allowing feedback synthesis for physical and engineering systems that are uncertain, nonlinear, and infinite-dimensional. The PDE backstepping literature has grown in its nearly a quarter century of development to many hundreds of papers and nearly a dozen books. This survey aims to facilitate the entry, for a new researcher, into this thriving area of overwhelming size and topical diversity. Designs of controllers and observers, for parabolic, hyperbolic, and other classes of PDEs, in one and more dimensions (in box and spherical geometries), with nonlinear, adaptive, sampled-data, and event-triggered extensions, are covered in the survey. The lifeblood of control are technology and physics. The survey places a particular emphasis on applications that have motivated the development of the theory and which have benefited from the theory and designs: applications involving flows, flexible structures, materials, thermal and chemically reacting dynamics, energy (from oil drilling to batteries and magnetic confinement fusions), and vehicles.</description>

      <title>A Network Flow Approach to Optimal Scheduling in Supply Chain Logistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving digital landscape, network flow models have transcended traditional applications to become integral in diverse sectors, including supply chain management. This research develops a robust network flow model for semiconductor wafer supply chains, optimizing resource allocation and addressing maximum flow challenges in production and logistics. The model incorporates the stochastic nature of wafer batch transfers and employs a dual-layer optimization framework to reduce variability and exceedance probabilities in finished goods. Empirical comparisons reveal significant enhancements in cost efficiency, productivity, and resource utilization, with a 20% reduction in time and production costs, and a 10% increase in transportation and storage capacities. The model's efficacy is underscored by a 15% decrease in transportation time and a 6700 kg increase in total capacity, demonstrating its capability to resolve logistical bottlenecks in semiconductor manufacturing. This study concludes that network flow models are a potent tool for optimizing supply chain logistics, offering a 23% improvement in resource utilization and a 13% boost in accuracy. The findings provide valuable insights for supply chain logistics optimization.</description>

Abstract: Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a popular data-driven method to predict the action of the Koopman operator, i.e., the evolution of an observable function along the flow of a dynamical system. In this paper, we leverage a recently-introduced kernel EDMD method for control systems for data-driven model predictive control. Building upon pointwise error bounds proportional in the state, we rigorously show practical asymptotic stability of the origin w.r.t. the MPC closed loop without stabilizing terminal conditions. The key novelty is that we avoid restrictive invariance conditions. Last, we verify our findings by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Logit-Q Dynamics for Efficient Learning in Stochastic Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new family of logit-Q dynamics for efficient learning in stochastic games by combining the log-linear learning (also known as logit dynamics) for the repeated play of normal-form games with Q-learning for unknown Markov decision processes within the auxiliary stage-game framework. In this framework, we view stochastic games as agents repeatedly playing some stage game associated with the current state of the underlying game while the agents' Q-functions determine the payoffs of these stage games. We show that the logit-Q dynamics presented reach (near) efficient equilibrium in stochastic teams with unknown dynamics and quantify the approximation error. We also show the rationality of the logit-Q dynamics against agents following pure stationary strategies and the convergence of the dynamics in stochastic games where the stage-payoffs induce potential games, yet only a single agent controls the state transitions beyond stochastic teams. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics with a fictional scenario where the Q-function estimates are stationary over epochs whose lengths grow at a sufficiently slow rate. We then couple the dynamics in the main and fictional scenarios to show that these two scenarios become more and more similar across epochs due to the vanishing step size and growing epoch lengths.</description>

      <title>Early Directional Convergence in Deep Homogeneous Neural Networks for Small Initializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the gradient flow dynamics that arise when training deep homogeneous neural networks assumed to have locally Lipschitz gradients and an order of homogeneity strictly greater than two. It is shown here that for sufficiently small initializations, during the early stages of training, the weights of the neural network remain small in (Euclidean) norm and approximately converge in direction to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the recently introduced neural correlation function. Additionally, this paper also studies the KKT points of the neural correlation function for feed-forward networks with (Leaky) ReLU and polynomial (Leaky) ReLU activations, deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for rank-one KKT points.</description>

      <title>Three quantitative versions of the P\'al inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The P\'al inequality is a classical result which asserts that among all planar convex sets of given width the equilateral triangle is the one of minimal area. In this paper we prove three quantitative versions of this inequality, by quantifying how the closeness of the area of a convex set, of certain width, to the minimal value implies its closeness to the equilateral triangle. As a by-product, we also present a novel result concerning a quantitative inequality for the inradius of a set, under minimal width constraint.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Discrete GCBF Proximal Policy Optimization for Multi-agent Safe Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control policies that can achieve high task performance and satisfy safety constraints are desirable for any system, including multi-agent systems (MAS). One promising technique for ensuring the safety of MAS is distributed control barrier functions (CBF). However, it is difficult to design distributed CBF-based policies for MAS that can tackle unknown discrete-time dynamics, partial observability, changing neighborhoods, and input constraints, especially when a distributed high-performance nominal policy that can achieve the task is unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we propose DGPPO, a new framework that simultaneously learns both a discrete graph CBF which handles neighborhood changes and input constraints, and a distributed high-performance safe policy for MAS with unknown discrete-time dynamics. We empirically validate our claims on a suite of multi-agent tasks spanning three different simulation engines. The results suggest that, compared with existing methods, our DGPPO framework obtains policies that achieve high task performance (matching baselines that ignore the safety constraints), and high safety rates (matching the most conservative baselines), with a constant set of hyperparameters across all environments.</description>

      <title>Localization of tumor through a non-conventional numerical shape optimization technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for estimating the shape and location of an embedded tumor. The approach utilizes shape optimization techniques, applying the coupled complex boundary method. By rewriting the problem--characterized by a measured temperature profile and corresponding flux (e.g., from infrared thermography)--into a complex boundary value problem with a complex Robin boundary condition, the method simplifies the over-specified nature of the problem. The size and location of the tumor are identified by optimizing a cost function based on the imaginary part of the solution across the domain. Shape sensitivity analysis is conducted to compute the shape derivative of the functional. An iterative algorithm, which uses the Riesz representative of the gradient, is developed to numerically determine the geometry of the tumor via the finite element method. Additionally, we analyze the mesh sensitivity of the finite element solution of the associated state problem and derive a bound on its variation in terms of mesh deformation and its gradient. The result, valid in any dimension, applies to arbitrary unstructured simplicial meshes and finite element approximations. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for Efficient Simulation of Power Systems with Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As inverter-based resources (IBRs) penetrate power systems, the dynamics become more complex, exhibiting multiple timescales, including electromagnetic transient (EMT) dynamics of power electronic controllers and electromechanical dynamics of synchronous generators. Consequently, the power system model becomes highly stiff, posing a challenge for efficient simulation using existing methods that focus on dynamics within a single timescale. This paper proposes a Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for highly efficient multi-timescale simulation of a power system represented by its EMT model. The new method alternates between the microscopic EMT model of the system and an automatically reduced macroscopic model, varying the step size accordingly to achieve significant acceleration while maintaining accuracy in both fast and slow dynamics of interests. It also incorporates a semi-analytical solution method to enable a more adaptive variable-step mechanism. The new simulation method is illustrated using a two-area system and is then tested on a detailed EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>
