      <title>Detection Limits of Thermal-Infrared Observations with Adaptive Optics: I. Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based thermal infrared observations face substantial challenges in correcting the predominant background emitted as thermal radiation from the atmosphere and the telescope itself. With the upcoming 40\,m class ELTs, unprecedented sensitivities from ground will be reached, underlining the need of even more sophisticated background correction strategies. This study aims to investigate the impact of thermal backgrounds on ground-based observations and identify possible limiting factors in dedicated correction strategies. We evaluate temporal and spatial characteristics of the thermal background in direct imaging data obtained with different telescopes and observation modes. In particular, three distinct datasets, acquired using VLT/NACO and KECK/NIRC2, are analyzed. Our analysis reveals that the observations are not fully photon shot noise limited, but exhibit additional sensitivity losses caused by imperfect background compensation in the different datasets. We identify correlations between background fluctuations and the activity of the adaptive optics system. We hypothesize that the pupil modulation of the adaptive optics mirrors introduces high frequency spatial and temporal fluctuations to the background, which could ultimately constrain the detection limit if they are not compensated adequately.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophotonics represents a cutting-edge approach in observational astronomy. This paper explores the significant advancements and potential applications of astrophotonics, highlighting how photonic technologies stand to revolutionise astronomical instrumentation. Key areas of focus include photonic wavefront sensing and imaging, photonic interferometry and nulling, advanced chip fabrication methods, and the integration of spectroscopy and sensing onto photonic chips. The role of single-mode fibres in reducing modal noise, and the development of photonic integral field units (IFUs) and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for high-resolution, spatially resolved spectroscopy will be examined. As part of the Sydney regional-focus issue, this review aims to detail some of the current technological achievements in this field as well as to discuss the future trajectory of astrophotonics, underscoring its potential to unlock important new astronomical discoveries.</description>

      <title>Analytical planar wavefront reconstruction and error estimates for radio detection of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When performing radio detection of ultra-high energy astroparticles, the planar wavefront model is often used as a first step to evaluate the arrival direction of primary particles, by adjusting the wavefront orientation based on the peak of signal traces of individual antennas. The benefits of this approach are however limited by the lack of a good evaluation of its robustness. In order to mitigate this limitation, we derive in this work an analytical solution for the arrival direction as well as the corresponding analytical reconstruction uncertainty. Because it is fast and robust, this reconstruction method can be used as a proxy for more complex estimators, or implemented online for low-level triggering.</description>

      <title>Challenges in focal plane and telescope calibration for High-Precision Space Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With sub-microarcsecond angular accuracy, the \theia telescope will be capable of revealing the architectures of nearby exoplanetary systems down to the mass of Earth. This research addresses the challenges inherent in space astrometry missions, focusing on focal plane calibration and telescope optical distortion. We propose to assess the future feasibility of large-format detectors (50 to 200 megapixels) in a controlled laboratory environment. The aim is to improve the architecture of the focal plane while ensuring that specifications are met. The use of field stars as metrological sources for calibrating the optical distortion of the field may help to constrain telescope stability. The paper concludes with an attempt to confirm in the laboratory the performance predicted by simulations. We will also address the possibility of using such techniques with a dedicated instrument for the Habitable World Observatory.</description>

      <title>The NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Array: Operability and Operations After Two Years of JWST Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope affords the astronomical community an unprecedented space-based Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) capability through the use of a programmable array of micro-electro-mechanical shutters. Launched in December 2021 and commissioned along with a suite of other observatory instruments throughout the first half of 2022, NIRSpec has been carrying out scientific observations since the completion of commissioning. These observations would not be possible without a rigorous program of engineering operations to actively monitor and maintain NIRSpec's hardware health and safety and enhance instrument efficiency and performance. Although MOS is only one of the observing modes available to users, the complexity and uniqueness of the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) that enables it has presented a variety of engineering challenges, including the appearance of electrical shorts that produce contaminating glow in exposures. Despite these challenges, the NIRSpec Multi-Object Spectrograph continues to perform robustly with no discernible degradation or significant reduction in capability.
  This paper provides an overview of the NIRSpec micro-shutter subsystem's state of health and operability and presents some of the developments that have taken place in its operation since the completion of instrument commissioning.</description>

      <title>ODUSSEAS: Upgraded version with new reference scale and parameter determinations for 82 planet-host M dwarf stars in SWEET-Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: Obtaining accurate derivations of stellar atmospheric parameters is crucial in the fields of stellar and exoplanet characterization. We present the upgraded version of our computational tool ODUSSEAS with a new reference scale applied to derive $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and [Fe/H] values for M dwarfs.
  Methods: The new reference dataset of ODUSSEAS consists of $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values based on interferometry, and [Fe/H] values derived by applying updated values for the parallaxes. These reference parameters are related to the pseudo-equivalent widths (EWs) of more than 4000 stellar absorption lines. The machine learning Python "scikit learn" package creates models to determine the stellar parameters for subsequent analysis.
  Results: We determined $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and [Fe/H] values for 82 planet-host stars in SWEET-Cat. We demonstrate that our new version of ODUSSEAS is capable of determining the parameters with a greater accuracy than the original by comparing our results to other methods in literature. We also compared our parameters for the same stars by measuring their spectra obtained from several instruments, showing the consistency of our determinations with standard deviation of 30 K and 0.03 dex. Finally, we examined the correlation among planetary mass and stellar metallicity, confirming prior evidence indicating that massive planets mainly form around metal-rich stars in the case of M dwarfs as well.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of highly inclined extensive air showers in GRAND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect highly inclined extensive air showers (EAS) with down-going and up-going trajectories. Several working groups in the GRAND collaboration are developing methods to reconstruct the incoming direction, core position, primary energy, and composition of the showers. The reconstruction pipeline -- currently under development in the France/IAP working group -- relies on a model of spherical wavefront emission for arrival times, which is possible because the radio signals are generated far away from the antenna stations. The amplitude distribution of the signals at the antenna level is described by an Angular Distribution Function that considers various asymmetries in the data, including geomagnetic effects. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from testing our EAS reconstruction procedure using realistic mock observations.</description>

      <title>The Blue Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (BlueMUSE) on the VLT: science drivers and overview of instrument design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BlueMUSE is a blue-optimised, medium spectral resolution, panoramic integral field spectrograph under development for the Very Large Telescope (VLT). With an optimised transmission down to 350 nm, spectral resolution of R$\sim$3500 on average across the wavelength range, and a large FoV (1 arcmin$^2$), BlueMUSE will open up a new range of galactic and extragalactic science cases facilitated by its specific capabilities. The BlueMUSE consortium includes 9 institutes located in 7 countries and is led by the Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon (CRAL). The BlueMUSE project development is currently in Phase A, with an expected first light at the VLT in 2031. We introduce here the Top Level Requirements (TLRs) derived from the main science cases, and then present an overview of the BlueMUSE system and its subsystems fulfilling these TLRs. We specifically emphasize the tradeoffs that are made and the key distinctions compared to the MUSE instrument, upon which the system architecture is built.</description>

      <title>The UK Submillimetre and Millimetre Astronomy Roadmap 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Roadmap, we present a vision for the future of submillimetre and millimetre astronomy in the United Kingdom over the next decade and beyond. This Roadmap has been developed in response to the recommendation of the Astronomy Advisory Panel (AAP) of the STFC in the AAP Astronomy Roadmap 2022. In order to develop our stragetic priorities and recommendations, we surveyed the UK submillimetre and millimetre community to determine their key priorities for both the near-term and long-term future of the field. We further performed detailed reviews of UK leadership in submillimetre/millimetre science and instrumentation. Our key strategic priorities are as follows: 1. The UK must be a key partner in the forthcoming AtLAST telescope, for which it is essential that the UK remains a key partner in the JCMT in the intermediate term. 2. The UK must maintain, and if possible enhance, access to ALMA and aim to lead parts of instrument development for ALMA2040. Our strategic priorities complement one another: AtLAST (a 50m single-dish telescope) and an upgraded ALMA (a large configurable interferometric array) would be in synergy, not competition, with one another. Both have identified and are working towards the same overarching science goals, and both are required in order to fully address these goals.</description>

      <title>Efficient gravitational-wave model for fully-precessing and moderately-eccentric, compact binary inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational-wave detectors, especially the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be sensitive to black hole binaries formed in astrophysical environments that promote large eccentricities and spin-induced orbital precession. Approximate models of gravitational waves that include both effects have only recently begun to be developed. The Efficient Fully Precessing Eccentric (EFPE) family is one such model, covering the inspiral stage with small-eccentricity-expanded gravitational-wave amplitudes accurate for initial time eccentricities $e &lt; 0.3$ at 4 years before reaching an orbital frequency of 1 Hz. In this work, we extend this model to cover a larger range of initial eccentricities. The new EFPE for moderate eccentricities (EFPE_ME) model is able to accurately represent the leading-order gravitational-wave amplitudes to $e \leq 0.8$. Comparing the EFPE and the EFPE_ME models in the LISA band, however, reveals that there is no significant difference when the eccentricity at 4 years before merger, $e_0$, is less than or equal to 0.5, as radiation reaction circularizes supermassive black hole binaries too quickly. This suggests that the EFPE model may have a larger regime of validity in eccentricity space than previously thought, making it suitable for some inspiral parameter estimation with LISA data. On the other hand, for systems with $e_0 &gt; 0.5$, the deviations between the models are significant, particularly for binaries with total masses below $10^5\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This suggests that the EFPE_ME model will be crucial to avoid systematic bias in parameter estimation with LISA in the future, once this model has been hybridized to include the merger and ringdown and the computation of the amplitudes is optimized.</description>

      <title>The updated BOSZ synthetic stellar spectral library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The modeling of stellar spectra of flux standards observed by the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes requires a large synthetic spectral library that covers a wide atmospheric parameter range.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to present and describe the calculation methods behind the updated version of the BOSZ synthetic spectral database, which was originally designed to fit the CALSPEC flux standards. These new local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models incorporate both MARCS and ATLAS9 model atmospheres, updated continuous opacities, and 23 new molecular line lists.
  Methods. The new grid was calculated with Synspec using the LTE approximation and covers metallicities [M/H] from -2.5 to 0.75 dex, [alpha/M] from -0.25 to 0.5 dex, and [C/M] from -0.75 to 0.5 dex, providing spectra for 336 unique compositions. Calculations for stars between 2800 and 8000 K use MARCS model atmospheres, and ATLAS9 is used between 7500 and 16,000 K.
  Results. The new BOSZ grid includes 628,620 synthetic spectra from 50 nm to 32 microns with models for 495 Teff - log g parameter pairs per composition and per microturbulent velocity. Each spectrum has eight different resolutions spanning a range from R = 500 to 50,000 as well as the original resolution of the synthesis. The microturbulent velocities are 0, 1, 2, and 4 km/s.
  Conclusions. The new BOSZ grid extends the temperature range to cooler temperatures compared to the original grid because the updated molecular line lists make modeling possible for cooler stars. A publicly available and consistently calculated database of model spectra is important for many astrophysical analyses, for example spectroscopic surveys and the determination of stellar elemental compositions.</description>
