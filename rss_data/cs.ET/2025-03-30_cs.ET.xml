      <title>Temperature-Resilient Analog Neuromorphic Chip in Single-Polysilicon CMOS Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analog neuromorphic chips, designers can embed computing primitives in the intrinsic physical properties of devices and circuits, heavily reducing device count and energy consumption, and enabling high parallelism, because all devices are computing simultaneously. Neural network parameters can be stored in local analog non-volatile memories (NVMs), saving the energy required to move data between memory and logic. However, the main drawback of analog sub-threshold electronic circuits is their dramatic temperature sensitivity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a temperature compensation mechanism can be devised to solve this problem. We have designed and fabricated a chip implementing a two-layer analog neural network trained to classify low-resolution images of handwritten digits with a low-cost single-poly complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, using unconventional analog NVMs for weight storage. We demonstrate a temperature-resilient analog neuromorphic chip for image recognition operating between 10$^{\circ}$C and 60$^{\circ}$C without loss of classification accuracy, within 2\% of the corresponding software-based neural network in the whole temperature range.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in solving decision-making and control problems of autonomous driving, which is increasingly applied in diverse driving scenarios. However, driving is a multi-attribute problem, leading to challenges in achieving multi-objective compatibility for current RL methods, especially in both policy execution and policy iteration. On the one hand, the common action space structure with single action type limits driving flexibility or results in large behavior fluctuations during policy execution. On the other hand, the multi-attribute weighted single reward function result in the agent's disproportionate attention to certain objectives during policy iterations. To this end, we propose a Multi-objective Ensemble-Critic reinforcement learning method with Hybrid Parametrized Action for multi-objective compatible autonomous driving. Specifically, a parameterized action space is constructed to generate hybrid driving actions, combining both abstract guidance and concrete control commands. A multi-objective critics architecture is constructed considering multiple attribute rewards, to ensure simultaneously focusing on different driving objectives. Additionally, uncertainty-based exploration strategy is introduced to help the agent faster approach viable driving policy. The experimental results in both the simulated traffic environment and the HighD dataset demonstrate that our method can achieve multi-objective compatible autonomous driving in terms of driving efficiency, action consistency, and safety. It enhances the general performance of the driving while significantly increasing training efficiency.</description>
