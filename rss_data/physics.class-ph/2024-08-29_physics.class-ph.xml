      <title>Analysis of critical points of the In-Vessel Retention safety evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-Vessel Retention (IVR) strategy for nuclear reactors in case of a Severe Accident (SA) intends to stabilize and retain the corium in the vessel by using the vessel wall as a heat exchanger with an external water loop. This strategy relies on simple actions to be passively taken as soon as SA signal is raised: vessel depressurization and reactor pit flooding. Then, the strategy is successful if the vessel keeps it integrity, which means that the heat flux coming from the corium pool does not exceed the cooling capacity of the External Reactor Vessel Cooling (ERVC) at each location along the vessel wall (no vessel melt-through) and the ablated vessel wall is mechanically resistant. The main uncertainties in this IVR safety evaluation are associated to the thermal load applied from the corium pool to the vessel wall and the resulting minimum vessel thickness after ablation. Indeed, the heat fluxes distribution along the vessel wall is directly dependent on the corium stratification which occurs as aresult of thermochemical interactions in the pool: when liquid steel is mixed with UO2 and partially oxidized Zr coming from the degradation of the fuel and claddings, there is a phase separation between oxide and metal phases due to a gap of miscibility. The primordial impact of the corium behaviour in the lower plenum of the reactor vessel on the IVR safety evaluation was clearly highlighted in the Phenomena Identification Ranking Table (PIRT) on IVR performed in the frame of the European IVMR (In-Vessel Melt Retention) project (Fichot et al., 2019). As a result, the focus is made in this paper on the critical points which impact the value of the minimum vessel thickness orequivalently the maximum heat flux reached at the outer surface of the vessel wall. Efficiency of the ERVC and mechanical resistance of the vessel wall are consequently not discussed here.The main objective is to identify the generic critical situations leading to an excessive heat flux to the vessel wall and the investigation of possible means to avoid them. In this perspective, the calculations of IVR strategy done by the project partners for different reactor designs and accident scenarios were used as a database to identify and understand the occurrence of critical configurations with excessive heat flux to the vessel wall. The results of 25 sequences are used, which correspond to 9 different reactor designs: a generic PWR 900MWe, a PWR 1100MWe with heavy reflector, a generic PWR 1300MWe, a generic Konvoi 1300MWe, a generic German BWR69, aNordic BWR, a BWR-5 Mark II, a VVER1000 and a VVER440/v213. In addition, different SA integral codes (ASTEC, ATHLET-CD, MAAP -combined with MAAP_EDF and PROCOR codes for simulation of lower plenum behavior-, MELCOR and RELAP/SCDAPSIM codes) are used.</description>

      <title>First part of Clausius heat theorem in terms of Noether's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After Helmholtz, the mechanical foundation of thermodynamics included the First Law $d E = \delta Q + \delta W$, and the first part of the Clausius heat theorem $\delta Q^\text{rev}/T = dS$. The resulting invariance of the entropy $S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection with Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an idea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa $\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for deriving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up with an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Enigmatic factor of 4/3 in electromagnetic momentum of a moving spherical capacitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic energy-momentum of a moving charged spherical capacitor may be calculated by a 4-vector Lorentz transformation from the energy in the rest frame. However, energy-momentum of the moving system computed directly from electromagnetic fields yields extra terms; in particular a factor of 4/3 in momentum appears, similar to that encountered in the classical electron model, where this enigmatic factor has been a source of scourge for more than a century. There have been many attempts to eliminate this `unwanted' factor, noteworthy among them is a modification in electromagnetic field energy-momentum definition that has entered even standard textbooks. Here it is shown that in a moving charged spherical capacitor, some additional contributions to the electromagnetic energy-momentum arise naturally from electromagnetic forces in system or equivalently from terms in the Maxwell stress tensor; contributions that do not otherwise show up in 4-vector transformations. Furthermore, a similar factor of 4/3 in the momentum of a perfect fluid comprising a randomly moving ultra-relativistic gas molecules or an isotropic photon gas, filling an {\em uncharged} spherical capacitor in motion, appears owing to the contribution of pressure. Thus, genesis of the "enigmatic" factor of 4/3 can be traced to pressure or stress whose presence in the system may be of non-electromagnetic origin and where the proposed modifications in energy-momentum definition do not even come into picture. No modifications in the definitions of energy-momentum of moving fluids have ever been required; physics should be the same in electromagnetic case as well, implying there is nothing amiss in the standard definition of electromagnetic energy-momentum.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Resistance Standards by a Precision LCR Meter at Frequencies up to 2 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on two-terminal-pair and four-terminal-pair test measurements of a 10-kohm resistance standard by means of a commercial precision LCR meter at frequencies up to 2 MHz. In the case of a two-terminal-pair configuration, we demonstrate that the effect of 2.5 m long measuring cables, which are inevitable for some special applications, can be corrected in the whole frequency range up to 2 MHz with an uncertainty of 9E-6 (k = 1) relative to the dc resistance value. Furthermore, the systematic effects of the LCR meter were investigated. Though distinctly larger than the resolution of the LCR meter, these effects are accurately reproducible. As such it should be possible in the future to calibrate the LCR meter against a well-known calculable high-frequency resistance standard with an uncertainty close to the few-parts-per-million type-A uncertainty of the LCR meter.</description>
