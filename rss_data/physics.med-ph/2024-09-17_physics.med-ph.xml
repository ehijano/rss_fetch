      <title>Mimicking large spot-scanning radiation fields for proton FLASH preclinical studies with a robotic motion platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, a synchrotron-based horizontal proton beamline (87.2 MeV) was successfully commissioned to deliver radiation doses in FLASH and conventional dose rate modes to small fields and volumes. In this study, we developed a strategy to increase the effective radiation field size using a custom robotic motion platform to automatically shift the positions of biological samples. The beam was first broadened with a thin tungsten scatterer and shaped by customized brass collimators for irradiating cell/organoid cultures in 96-well plates (a 7-mm-diameter circle) or for irradiating mice (1-cm2 square). Motion patterns of the robotic platform were written in G-code, with 9-mm spot spacing used for the 96-well plates and 10.6-mm spacing for the mice. The accuracy of target positioning was verified with a self-leveling laser system. The dose delivered in the experimental conditions was validated with EBT-XD film attached to the 96-well plate or the back of the mouse. Our film-measured dose profiles matched Monte Carlo calculations well (1D gamma pass rate &gt;95%). The FLASH dose rates were 113.7 Gy/s for cell/organoid irradiation and 191.3 Gy/s for mouse irradiation. These promising results indicate that this robotic platform can be used to effectively increase the field size for preclinical experiments with proton FLASH.</description>

      <title>Superconducting and low temperature RF Coils for Ultra-Low-Field MRI: A Study on SNR Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study incorporates electromagnetic simulations to assess the performance of multi-turn solenoid coils for ultra-low field MR imaging with various conductor materials (superconducting material, low-temperature copper, and room-temperature copper) across different human samples (elbow, knee, and brain). At 70 mT, superconducting materials performed significantly better than both room-temperature and low-temperature copper. The high Q-factor of the superconducting material indicates lower energy loss, which is useful for MR imaging. Furthermore, B1+ field efficiency increased significantly with superconducting materials, indicating superior performance. SNR evaluations revealed that materials with higher conductivity significantly improve SNR, which is critical for producing high-quality MR images. These results show that superconducting and low-temperature copper materials can significantly improve MR imaging quality at ultra-low fields, which has important implications for coil design and optimization.</description>

      <title>The i-TED Compton Camera Array for real-time boron imaging and determination during treatments in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the adaptation and application of i-TED Compton imagers for real-time dosimetry in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). The i-TED array, previously utilized in nuclear astrophysics experiments at CERN, is being optimized for detecting and imaging 478 keV gamma-rays, critical for accurate BNCT dosimetry. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations were used to optimize the i-TED detector configuration and enhance its performance in the challenging radiation environment typical of BNCT. Additionally, advanced 3D image reconstruction algorithms, including a combination of back-projection and List-Mode Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (LM-MLEM), are implemented and validated through simulations. Preliminary experimental tests at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) demonstrate the potential of i-TED in a clinical setting, with ongoing experiments focusing on improving imaging capabilities in realistic BNCT conditions.</description>

      <title>A Method for Accurate Spatial Focusing Simulation via Numerical Integration and its Application in Optoacoustic Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial sensitivity of an ultrasound transducer, which strongly influences its suitability for different applications, depends on the shape of the transducer surface. Accurate simulation of these spatial effects is important for transducer characterization and design, and for system response modelling in imaging applications. In optoacoustic imaging, broadband transducers are used to capitalize on the rich frequency content of the signals, but their usage makes highly accurate simulations with general wave equation solvers prohibitively memory- and time-intensive. Therefore, specialized tools for simulating the isolated spatial focusing properties described by the spatial impulse response (SIR) have been developed. However, the challenging numerics of the SIR and the necessity to convolve the SIR with the wave shape generated by the optoacoustic absorber to simulate the system response lead to numerical inaccuracies of SIR-based methods. In addition, the approximation error of these methods cannot be controlled a priori. To circumvent the problems associated with the explicit calculation of SIR, we propose directly computing the convolution of the required wave shape with the SIR, which we call the spatial pulse response (SPR). We demonstrate that by utilizing an h-adaptive cubature algorithm, SPR can be computed with significantly higher accuracy than an SIR-based reference method, and the approximation error can be controlled with a tolerance parameter. In addition, the integration of accurate SPR simulations into model-based optoacoustic image reconstruction is shown to improve image contrast and reduce noise artifacts. Precise system characterization and simulation leads to improved imaging performance, ultimately increasing the value of optoacoustic imaging systems for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Haralick texture feature analysis for Monte Carlo dose distributions of permanent implant prostate brachytherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Demonstrate quantitative characterization of 3D patient-specific absorbed dose distributions using Haralick texture analysis and interpret measures in terms of underlying physics and radiation dosimetry. Methods: Retrospective analysis is performed for 137 patients who underwent permanent implant prostate brachytherapy using two simulation conditions: ``TG186'' (realistic tissues including 0-3.8% intraprostatic calcifications; interseed attenuation) and ``TG43'' (water-model; no interseed attenuation). Haralick features (homogeneity, contrast, correlation, local homogeneity, entropy) are calculated using the original Haralick formalism, and a modified approach designed to reduce grey-level quantization sensitivity. Trends in textural features are compared to clinical dosimetric measures (D90; minimum absorbed dose to the hottest 90% of a volume) and changes in patient target volume % intraprostatic calcifications by volume (%IC). Results: Both original and modified measures quantify the spatial differences in absorbed dose distributions. Strong correlations between differences in textural measures calculated under TG43 and TG186 conditions and %IC are observed for all measures. For example, differences between measures of contrast and correlation increase and decrease respectively as patients with higher levels of %IC are evaluated, reflecting the large differences across adjacent voxels (higher dose in voxels with calcification) when calculated under TG186 conditions. Conversely, the D90 metric is relatively weakly correlated with textural measures, as it generally does not characterize the spatial distribution of absorbed dose. Conclusion: patient-specific 3D dose distributions may be quantified using Haralick analysis, and trends may be interpreted in terms of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>OpenDosimeter: Open Hardware Personal X-ray Dosimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present OpenDosimeter (https://opendosimeter.org/), an open hardware solution for real-time personal X-ray dose monitoring based on a scintillation counter. Using an X-ray sensor assembly (LYSO + SiPM) on a custom board powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, OpenDosimeter provides real-time feedback (1 Hz), data logging (10 hours), and battery-powered operation. One of the core innovations is that we calibrate the device using $^{241}$Am found in ionization smoke detectors. Specifically, we use the $\gamma$-emissions to spectrally calibrate the dosimeter, then calculate the effective dose from X-ray exposure by compensating for the scintillator absorption efficiency and applying energy-to-dose coefficients derived from tabulated data in the ICRP 116 publication. We demonstrate that this transparent approach enables real-time dose rate readings with a linear response between 0.1-1000 $\mu$Sv/h at $\pm$25% accuracy, tested for energies up to 120 keV. The maximum dose rate readings are limited by pile-up effects when approaching count rate saturation ($\sim$77 kcps at $\sim$13 $\mu$s average pulse processing time). The total component cost for making an OpenDosimeter is &lt;\$100, which, combined with its open design (both hardware and software), enables cost-effective local reproducibility on a global scale. This paper complements the open-source documentation by explaining the underlying technology, the algorithm for dose calculation, and areas for future improvement.</description>

      <title>AutoPET Challenge III: Testing the Robustness of Generalized Dice Focal Loss trained 3D Residual UNet for FDG and PSMA Lesion Segmentation from Whole-Body PET/CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated segmentation of cancerous lesions in PET/CT scans is a crucial first step in quantitative image analysis. However, training deep learning models for segmentation with high accuracy is particularly challenging due to the variations in lesion size, shape, and radiotracer uptake. These lesions can appear in different parts of the body, often near healthy organs that also exhibit considerable uptake, making the task even more complex. As a result, creating an effective segmentation model for routine PET/CT image analysis is challenging. In this study, we utilized a 3D Residual UNet model and employed the Generalized Dice Focal Loss function to train the model on the AutoPET Challenge 2024 dataset. We conducted a 5-fold cross-validation and used an average ensembling technique using the models from the five folds. In the preliminary test phase for Task-1, the average ensemble achieved a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.6687, mean false negative volume (FNV) of 10.9522 ml and mean false positive volume (FPV) 2.9684 ml. More details about the algorithm can be found on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/ahxmeds/autosegnet2024.git. The training code has been shared via the repository: https://github.com/ahxmeds/autopet2024.git.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization algorithms for CT image segmentation from X-ray data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is an important imaging technique used in medical analysis of the internal structure of the human body. Previously, image segmentation methods were required after acquiring reconstructed CT images to obtain segmented CT images which made it susceptible to errors from both reconstruction and segmentation algorithms. However, this paper introduces a new approach using an advanced quantum optimization algorithm called quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). This algorithm enables acquisition of segmented CT images from X-ray projection data with minimized discrepancies between experimentally obtained sinograms and quantized sinograms derived from quantized segmented CT images using the Radon transform. This study utilized D-Wave's hybrid solver system for verification on real-world X-ray data.</description>
