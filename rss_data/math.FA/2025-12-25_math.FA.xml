      <title>Optimal Algorithms for Nonlinear Estimation with Convex Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear functional of an object from a convex symmetric set can be optimally estimated, in a worst-case sense, by a linear functional of observations made on the object. This well-known fact is extended here to a nonlinear setting: other simple functionals of the object can be optimally estimated by functionals of the observations that share a similar simple structure. This is established for the maximum of several linear functionals and even for the $\ell$th largest among them. Proving the latter requires an unusual refinement of the analytical Hahn--Banach theorem. The existence results are accompanied by practical recipes relying on convex optimization to construct the desired functionals, thereby justifying the term of estimation algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is essentially a survey on several classical results of harmonic analysis and their recent extensions to Banach spaces. The first part of the paper is a summary of some important results in such topics as Bernstein spaces, Shannon-type sampling, Riesz and Boas interpolation formulas. The second part contains extensions of these ideas to Banach spaces equipped with one-parameter uniformly bounded group of operators of class $C_{0}$.</description>

      <title>On stability of Weak Greedy Algorithm in the presence of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the theoretical study of the efficiency, namely, stability of some greedy algorithms. In the greedy approximation theory researchers are mostly interested in the following two important properties of an algorithm -- convergence and rate of convergence. In this paper we present some results on one more important property of an algorithm -- stability. Stability means that small perturbations do not result in a large change in the outcome of the algorithm. In this paper we discuss one kind of perturbations -- noisy data.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions and asymptotics for resonant oscillatory problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of oscillatory resonant problems, involving Dirichlet problems for semilinear PDE's on balls and rectangles in $R^n$, we show the existence of infinitely many solutions, and study the global solution set. The first harmonic of the right hand side is not required to be zero, or small. We also derive asymptotic formulas in terms of the first harmonic of solutions, and illustrate their accuracy by numerical computations. The numerical method is explained in detail.</description>

      <title>An Ando-type dilation on right LCM monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an Ando-type dilation theorem for a pair of commuting contractions together with a representation of a right LCM monoid via either the Cartesian or the free product. We prove that if each individual contraction together with the monoid representation has $*$-regular dilation, then they can be dilated to commuting isometries and an isometric representation of the monoid. This extends an earlier result of Barik and Das.</description>

      <title>Isometric Structure in Noncommutative Symmetric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a systematic study of isometries between noncommutative symmetric spaces. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a semifinite von Neumann algebra (or an atomic von Neumann algebra with all atoms having the same trace) acting on a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ equipped with a semifinite faithful normal trace $\tau$. We show that for any noncommutative symmetric space corresponding to a symmetric function space $E(0,\infty)$ in the sense of Lindenstrauss--Tzafriri such that $\left\|\cdot\right\|_E\ne \lambda \left\|\cdot\right\|_{L_2}$, $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}_+$, any isometry on $E(\mathcal{M},\tau)$ is of elementary form. This answers a long-standing open question raised in the 1980s in the non-separable setting [Math. Z. 1989], while the case of separable symmetric function spaces was treated in
  [Huang \&amp; Sukochev, JEMS, 2024]. As an application, we obtain a noncommutative Kalton--Randrianantoanina--Zaidenberg Theorem, providing a characterization of noncommutative $L_p$-spaces over finite von Neumann algebras and a necessary and sufficient condition for an operator on a noncommutative symmetric space to be an isometry. Having this at hand, we answer a question posed by Mityagin in 1970 [Uspehi Mat. Nauk] and its noncommutative counterpart by showing the any symmetric space $E(\mathcal{M},\tau)\ne L_p(\mathcal{M},\tau)$ over a noncommutative probability is not isometric to a symmetric space over a von Neumann algebra equipped with a semifinite infinite faithful normal trace. It is also shown that any noncommutative $L_p$-space, $1\le p&lt;\infty$, affiliated with an atomless semifinite von Neumann algebra has a unique symmetric structure up to isometries. This contributes to the resolution of an isometric version of Pe\l czy\'nski's problem concerning the uniqueness of the symmetric structure in noncommutative symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>$k$-Homogeneous Equiangular Tight Frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider geometric and combinatorial characterizations of equiangular tight frames (ETFs), with the former concerning homogeneity of the vector and line symmetry groups and the latter the matroid structure. We introduce the concept of the bender of a frame, which is the collection of short circuits, which in turn are the dependent subsets of frame vectors of minimum size. We also show that ETFs with $k$-homogeneous line symmetry groups have benders which are $k$-designs. Paley ETFs are a known class of ETFs constructed using number theory. We determine the line and vector symmetry groups of all Paley ETFs and show that they are $2$-homogeneous. We additionally characterize all $k$-homogeneous ETFs for $k\geq 3$. Finally, we revisit David Larson's AMS Memoirs \emph{Frames, Bases, and Group Representations} coauthored with Deguang Han and \emph{Wandering Vectors for Unitary Systems and Orthogonal Wavelets} coauthored with Xingde Dai with a modern eye and focus on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the homogeneous (inhomogeneous) matrix weighted Bourgain-Morrey Triebel-Lizorkin spaces and obtain their equivalent norms. We also obtain their characterizations by Peetre type maximal functions, Lusin-area function, Littlewood-Paley $g_{\lambda}^{*}$-function, approximation, wavelet and atom. As an application, we obtain boundedness of pseudo-differential operators with symbols in the H\"{o}rmander classes and H\"{o}lder-Zygmund classes on inhomogeneous matrix weighted Bourgain-Morrey Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Theorem for Path-Averaged Contractions in Complete b-Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the fixed point result for Path-Averaged Contractions (PA-contractions) from complete metric spaces to complete b-metric spaces. We prove that every PA-contraction on a complete b-metric space has a unique fixed point, provided the contraction constant $ \alpha $ satisfies $s \alpha^{1/N} &lt; 1$, where $ s \geq 1 $ is the b-metric coefficient and $N$ the averaging parameter. Moreover, we establish that every PA-contraction is automatically continuous. The proof relies on geometric decay of successive distances and the generalized triangle inequality. This result paves the way for extending averaged contraction principles to other classical types, such as Kannan, Chatterjea, and \'Ciri\'c-type mappings, as well as Wardowski's F-contractions, in generalized metric settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be sectorial operators in a Banach space $X$ of angles $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$, respectively, where $\omega_A+\omega_B&lt;\pi$. We present a simple and common approach to results on closedness of the operator sum $A+B$, based on Littlewood-Paley type norms and tools from several interpolation theories. This allows us to give short proofs for the well-known results due to Da~Prato-Grisvard and Kalton-Weis. We prove a new result in $\ell^q$-interpolation spaces and illustrate it with a maximal regularity result for abstract parabolic equations. Our approach also yields a new proof for the Dore-Venni result.</description>

      <title>Concrete examples of the rate of convergence of Chernoff approximations: numerical results for the heat semigroup and open questions on them (with appendix: full list of pictures and Python code)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05284v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the construction of examples that illustrate (using computer calculations) the rate of convergence of Chernoff approximations to the solution of the Cauchy problem for the heat equation. We are interested in the Chernoff theorem in general and select the heat semigroup as a model case because this semigroup (and solutions of the heat equations) are known, so it is easy to measure the distance between the exact solution and its Chernoff approximations. Two Chernoff functions (of the first and second order of Chernoff tangency to the generator of the heat semigroup, i.e. to the operator of taking the second derivative) and several initial conditions of different smoothness are considered. From the numerically plotted graphs, visually, it is determined that the approximations are close to the solution. For each of the two Chernoff functions, for several initial conditions of different smoothness and for approximation numbers up to 11 inclusive, the error (i.e. the supremum of the absolute value of the difference between the exact solution and the approximating function) corresponding to each approximation was numerically found. As it turned out, in all the cases studied, the dependence of the error on the number of the approximation has an approximately power-law form (we call this power the order of convergence). This follows from the fact that, as we discovered, the dependence of the logarithm of the error on the logarithm of the approximation number is approximately linear. Using the considered family of initial conditions, an empirical dependence of the order of convergence on the smoothness class of the initial condition is found. The orders of convergence for all the initial conditions studied are collected in a table.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Random Partial Sphere Coverings in High Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $N$ geodesic caps on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and whose total normalized surface area sums to one, what is the maximal surface area their union can cover? In this work, we provide an asymptotically sharp upper bound for an antipodal partial covering of the sphere by $N \in (\omega(1),e^{o(\sqrt{d})})$ congruent caps, showing that the maximum proportion covered approaches $1 - e^{-1}$ as $d\to\infty$. We discuss the relation of this result to the optimality of random polytopes in high dimensions, the limitations of our technique via the Gaussian surface area bounds of K. Ball and F. Nazarov, and its applications in computer science theory.</description>

      <title>How Far do Lindbladians Go?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study controllability of finite-dimensional open quantum systems under a general Markovian control model combining full coherent (unitary) control with tunable dissipative channels. Assuming the Hamiltonian controls is a H\"ormander system that generate $\mathfrak{su}(n)$, we ask how little dissipation suffices to make the full state space $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})$ controllable. We show that minimal non-unital noise can break unitary-orbit invariants and, in many cases, a very small set of jump operators yields transitivity on $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})$. For multi-qubit systems we prove explicit transitivity results for natural resources such as a single-qubit amplitude-damping jump together with a dephasing channel, and we identify obstructions when only self-adjoint jump operators are available (yielding only unital evolutions).
  We further develop a geometric viewpoint and ask the ``lifting'' question: when can a path of densities be obtained from applying a time-dependent family of Lindbladian to an initial state? For this, we have to analyze the tangent structure of the ``manifold with corners'' and how this tangent structure reflects Lindbldian evolution. Building on this framework, we derive reachability criteria and no-go results based on a norm-decrease alignment condition, including a geometric obstruction arising from the incompatibility between admissible tangent directions and dissipative contraction.</description>

      <title>Band-Limited Equivalence of Convolution Operators and its Application to Filtered Vorticity Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we established a general theorem regarding the equivalence of convolution operators restricted to a finite spectral band. We demonstrated that two kernels with identical Fourier transforms over the resolved band act identically on all band-limited functions, even if their kernels differ outside the band. This property is significant in applied mathematics and computational physics, particularly in scenarios where measurements or simulations are spectrally truncated. As an application, we examine the proportionality relation $S(\boldsymbol {r}) \approx \zeta\,\omega(\boldsymbol{r})$ in filtered vorticity dynamics and clarify why real-space diagnostics can underestimate the spectral proportionality due to unobservable degrees of freedom. Our theoretical findings were supported by numerical illustrations using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>A generic transformation is invertible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that on a standard non-atomic probability space the set of all invertible measure-preserving transformations is residual in the set of all measure-preserving transformations with respect to the strong (=weak) operator topology. This implies that all properties which are generic for invertible transformations are also generic for general ones.</description>
