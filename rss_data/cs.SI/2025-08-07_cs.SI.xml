      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of Mobility Periodicity for Understanding Urban Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering the temporal regularity of human mobility is crucial for discovering urban dynamics and has implications for various decision-making processes and urban system applications. This study formulates the periodicity quantification problem in complex and multidimensional human mobility data as a sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series autoregression, allowing one to discover and quantify significant periodic patterns such as weekly periodicity from a data-driven and interpretable machine learning perspective. We apply our framework to real-world human mobility data, including metro passenger flow in Hangzhou, China and ridesharing trips in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, USA, revealing the interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past several years. In particular, our analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to 2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility regularity and the subsequent recovery trends, highlighting differences in the recovery pattern percentages and speeds between NYC and Chicago. We explore that both NYC and Chicago experienced a remarkable reduction of weekly periodicity in 2020, and the recovery of mobility regularity in NYC is faster than Chicago. The interpretability of sparse autoregression provides insights into the underlying temporal patterns of human mobility, offering a valuable tool for understanding urban systems. Our findings highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to unlock crucial insights from real-world mobility data.</description>

      <title>Using Stochastic Block Models for Community Detection: The issue of edge-connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relevant, sometimes overlooked, quality criterion for communities in graphs is that they should be well-connected in addition to being edge-dense. Prior work has shown that leading community detection methods can produce poorly-connected communities, and some even produce internally disconnected communities. A recent study by Park et al. in Complex Networks and their Applications 2024 showed that this problem is evident in clusterings from three Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) in graph-tool, a popular software package. To address this issue, Park et al. presented a simple technique, Well-Connected Clusters (WCC), that repeatedly finds and removes small edge cuts of size at most $\log_{10}n$ in clusters, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the cluster, and showed that treatment of graph-tool SBM clusterings with WCC improves accuracy. Here we examine the question of cluster connectivity for clusterings computed using other SBM software or nested SBMs within graph-tool. Our study, using a wide range of real-world and synthetic networks, shows that all tested SBM clustering methods produce communities that are disconnected, and that graph-tool improves on PySBM. We provide insight into why graph-tool degree-corrected SBM clustering produces disconnected clusters by examining the description length formula it uses, and explore the impact of modifications to the description length formula. Finally, we show that WCC provides an improvement in accuracy for both flat and nested SBMs and establish that it scales to networks with millions of nodes.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical community detection via maximum entropy partitions and the renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying meaningful structure across multiple scales remains a central challenge in network science. We introduce Hierarchical Clustering Entropy (HCE), a general and model-agnostic framework for detecting informative levels in hierarchical community structures. Unlike existing approaches, HCE operates directly on dendrograms without relying on edge-level statistics. It selects resolution levels that maximize a principled trade-off between the entropy of the community size distribution and the number of communities, corresponding to scales of high structural heterogeneity. This criterion applies to dendrograms produced by a wide range of clustering algorithms and distance metrics, including modularity-based and correlation-based methods. We evaluate HCE on synthetic benchmarks with varying degrees of hierarchy, size imbalance, and noise, including LFR and both symmetric and asymmetric multiscale models, and show that it consistently identifies partitions closely aligned with ground truth. Applied to real-world networks in social and neuroscience systems, HCE reveals interpretable modular hierarchies that align with known structural and functional organizations. As a scalable and principled method, HCE offers a general, domain-independent approach to hierarchical community detection with potential applications across biological, social, and technological systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Clique Discovery via Energy Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering quasi-cliques -- subgraphs with edge density no less than a given threshold -- is a fundamental task in graph mining, with broad applications in social networks, bioinformatics, and e-commerce. Existing heuristics often rely on greedy rules, similarity measures, or metaheuristic search, but struggle to maintain both efficiency and solution consistency across diverse graphs. This paper introduces EDQC, a novel quasi-clique discovery algorithm inspired by energy diffusion. Instead of explicitly enumerating candidate subgraphs, EDQC performs stochastic energy diffusion from source vertices, naturally concentrating energy within structurally cohesive regions. The approach enables efficient dense subgraph discovery without exhaustive search or dataset-specific tuning. Experimental results on 30 real-world datasets demonstrate that EDQC consistently discovers larger quasi-cliques than state-of-the-art baselines on the majority of datasets, while also yielding lower variance in solution quality. To the best of our knowledge, EDQC is the first method to incorporate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery.</description>

      <title>Tweets vs Pathogen Spread: A Case Study of COVID-19 in American States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of the mutual influence that awareness and disease may exert on each other has recently presented significant challenges. The actions individuals take to prevent contracting a disease and their level of awareness can profoundly affect the dynamics of its spread. Simultaneously, disease outbreaks impact how people become aware. In response, we initially propose a null model that couples two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) dynamics and analyze it using a mean-field approach. Subsequently, we explore the parameter space to quantify the effects of this mutual influence on various observables. Finally, based on this null model, we conduct an empirical analysis of Twitter data related to COVID-19 and confirmed cases within American states. Our findings indicate that in specific regions of the parameter space, it is possible to suppress the epidemic by increasing awareness, and we investigate phase transitions. Furthermore, our model demonstrates the ability to alter the dominant population group by adjusting parameters throughout the course of the outbreak. Additionally, using the model, we assign a set of parameters to each state, revealing that these parameters change at different pandemic peaks. Notably, a robust correlation emerges between the ranking of states' Twitter activity, as gathered from empirical data, and the immunity parameters assigned to each state using our model. This observation underscores the pivotal role of sustained awareness transitioning from the initial to the subsequent peaks in the disease progression.</description>

      <title>Graph Representation Learning with Massive Unlabeled Data for Rumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of social media, rumors spread quickly, cause great harm to society and economy. Thereby, many effective rumor detection methods have been developed, among which the rumor propagation structure learning based methods are particularly effective compared to other methods. However, the existing methods still suffer from many issues including the difficulty to obtain large-scale labeled rumor datasets, which leads to the low generalization ability and the performance degeneration on new events since rumors are time-critical and usually appear with hot topics or newly emergent events. In order to solve the above problems, in this study, we used large-scale unlabeled topic datasets crawled from the social media platform Weibo and Twitter with claim propagation structure to improve the semantic learning ability of a graph reprentation learing model on various topics. We use three typical graph self-supervised methods, InfoGraph, JOAO and GraphMAE in two commonly used training strategies, to verify the performance of general graph semi-supervised methods in rumor detection tasks. In addition, for alleviating the time and topic difference between unlabeled topic data and rumor data, we also collected a rumor dataset covering a variety of topics over a decade (10-year ago from 2022) from the Weibo rumor-refuting platform. Our experiments show that these general graph self-supervised learning methods outperform previous methods specifically designed for rumor detection tasks and achieve good performance under few-shot conditions, demonstrating the better generalization ability with the help of our massive unlabeled topic dataset.</description>

      <title>Assortativity in geometric and scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assortative behavior of a network is the tendency of similar (or dissimilar) nodes to connect to each other. This tendency can have an influence on various properties of the network, such as its robustness or the dynamics of spreading processes. In this paper, we study degree assortativity both in real-world networks and in several generative models for networks with heavy-tailed degree distribution based on latent spaces. In particular, we study Chung-Lu Graphs and Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs).
  Previous research on assortativity has primarily focused on measuring the degree assortativity in real-world networks using the Pearson assortativity coefficient, despite reservations against this coefficient. We rigorously confirm these reservations by mathematically proving that the Pearson assortativity coefficient does not measure assortativity in any network with sufficiently heavy-tailed degree distributions, which is typical for real-world networks. Moreover, we find that other single-valued assortativity coefficients also do not sufficiently capture the wiring preferences of nodes, which often vary greatly by node degree. We therefore take a more fine-grained approach, analyzing a wide range of conditional and joint weight and degree distributions of connected nodes, both numerically in real-world networks and mathematically in the generative graph models. We provide several methods of visualizing the results.
  We show that the generative models are assortativity-neutral, while many real-world networks are not. Therefore, we also propose an extension of the GIRG model which retains the manifold desirable properties induced by the degree distribution and the latent space, but also exhibits tunable assortativity. We analyze the resulting model mathematically, and give a fine-grained quantification of its assortativity.</description>

      <title>Layers of a City: Network-Based Insights into San Diego's Transportation Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing the structure and function of urban transportation networks is critical for enhancing mobility, equity, and resilience. This paper leverages network science to conduct a multi-modal analysis of San Diego's transportation system. We construct a multi-layer graph using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), representing driving, walking, and public transit layers. By integrating thousands of Points of Interest (POIs), we analyze network accessibility, structure, and resilience through centrality measures, community detection, and a proposed metric for walkability.
  Our analysis reveals a system defined by a stark core-periphery divide. We find that while the urban core is well-integrated, 30.3% of POIs are isolated from public transit within a walkable distance, indicating significant equity gaps in suburban and rural access. Centrality analysis highlights the driving network's over-reliance on critical freeways as bottlenecks, suggesting low network resilience, while confirming that San Diego is not a broadly walkable city. Furthermore, community detection demonstrates that transportation mode dictates the scale of mobility, producing compact, local clusters for walking and broad, regional clusters for driving. Collectively, this work provides a comprehensive framework for diagnosing urban mobility systems, offering quantitative insights that can inform targeted interventions to improve transportation equity and infrastructure resilience in San Diego.</description>

      <title>A Social Data-Driven System for Identifying Estate-related Events and Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply embedded in our everyday life, offering a dynamic stream of localized news and personal experiences. The ubiquity of these platforms position them as valuable resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based system for the detection and classification of estate-related events from social media content. Our system employs a hierarchical classification framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response and situational awareness.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Framework for Network Formation in Large Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of network formation in large populations. Each agent can choose the strength of interaction (i.e. connection) with other agents to find a Nash equilibrium. Different from the recently-developed theory of graphon games, here each agent's control depends not only on her own index but also on the index of other agents. After defining the general model of the game, we focus on a special case with piecewise constant graphs and we provide optimality conditions through a system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we show the uniqueness and existence results. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to discuss the effects of different model settings.</description>

      <title>Privacy Risk Predictions Based on Fundamental Understanding of Personal Data and an Evolving Threat Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is difficult for individuals and organizations to protect personal information without a fundamental understanding of relative privacy risks. By analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another). Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of another attribute?</description>

      <title>Universal Patterns in the Blockchain: Analysis of EOAs and Smart Contracts in ERC20 Token Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws offer a powerful lens to understand complex transactional behaviors in decentralized systems. This study reveals distinctive statistical signatures in the transactional dynamics of ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain by examining over 44 million token transfers between July 2017 and March 2018 (9-month period). Transactions are categorized into four types: EOA--EOA, EOA--SC, SC-EOA, and SC-SC based on whether the interacting addresses are Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) or Smart Contracts (SCs), and analyzed across three equal periods (each of 3 months). To identify universal statistical patterns, we investigate the presence of two canonical scaling laws: power law distributions and temporal Taylor's law (TL). EOA-driven transactions exhibit consistent statistical behavior, including a near-linear relationship between trade volume and unique partners with stable power law exponents ($\gamma \approx 2.3$), and adherence to TL with scaling coefficients ($\beta \approx 2.3$). In contrast, interactions involving SCs, especially SC-SC, exhibit sublinear scaling, unstable power-law exponents, and significantly fluctuating Taylor coefficients (variation in $\beta$ to be $\Delta\beta = 0.51$). Moreover, SC-driven activity displays heavier-tailed distributions ($\gamma &lt; 2$), indicating bursty and algorithm-driven activity. These findings reveal the characteristic differences between human-controlled and automated transaction behaviors in blockchain ecosystems. By uncovering universal scaling behaviors through the integration of complex systems theory and blockchain data analytics, this work provides a principled framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms of decentralized financial systems.</description>
