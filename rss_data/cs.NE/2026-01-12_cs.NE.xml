      <title>Evolving Cognitive Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05277</link>

Abstract: This article proposes a research and development direction that would lead to the creation of next-generation intelligent technical systems. A distinctive feature of these systems is their ability to undergo evolutionary change. Cognitive architectures are now one of the most promising ways to create Artificial General Intelligence systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition.</description>

      <title>Advanced Multimodal Learning for Seizure Detection and Prediction: Concept, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide, and poses significant risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conventional unimodal approaches, primarily reliant on electroencephalography (EEG), face several key challenges, including low SNR, nonstationarity, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, portability, and real-time applicability in clinical settings. To address these issues, a comprehensive survey highlights the concept of advanced multimodal learning for epileptic seizure detection and prediction (AMLSDP). The survey presents the evolution of epileptic seizure detection (ESD) and prediction (ESP) technologies across different eras. The survey also explores the core challenges of multimodal and non-EEG-based ESD and ESP. To overcome the key challenges of the multimodal system, the survey introduces the advanced processing strategies for efficient AMLSDP. Furthermore, this survey highlights future directions for researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will advance neurotechnology toward wearable and imaging-based solutions for epilepsy monitoring, serving as a valuable resource for future innovations in this domain.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>
