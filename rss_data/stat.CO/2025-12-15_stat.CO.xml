      <title>Candidate set sampling: A note on theoretical guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we introduce a simple numerical sampling method, called candidate set sampling, which is based on an straightforward discretization to the density function. This method requires the knowledge of the density function (up to an unknown normalizing constant) only. Furthermore, candidate set sampling is non-iterative, dimension-free, and easy to implement, with fast convergence and low computational cost. We present its basic convergence properties in the note.</description>

      <title>On a class of constrained Bayesian filters and their numerical implementation in high-dimensional state-space Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian filtering is a key tool in many problems that involve the online processing of data, including data assimilation, optimal control, nonlinear tracking and others. Unfortunately, the implementation of filters for nonlinear, possibly high-dimensional, dynamical systems is far from straightforward, as computational methods have to meet a delicate trade-off involving stability, accuracy and computational cost. In this paper we investigate the design, and theoretical features, of constrained Bayesian filters for state space models. The constraint on the filter is given by a sequence of compact subsets of the state space that determines the sources and targets of the Markov transition kernels in the dynamical model. Subject to such constraints, we provide sufficient conditions for filter stability and approximation error rates with respect to the original (unconstrained) Bayesian filter. Then, we look specifically into the implementation of constrained filters in a continuous-discrete setting where the state of the system is a continuous-time stochastic It\^o process but data are collected sequentially over a time grid. We propose an implementation of the constraint that relies on a data-driven modification of the drift of the It\^o process using barrier functions, and discuss the relation of this scheme with methods based on the Doob $h$-transform. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed methods in computer experiments for a partially-observed stochastic Lorenz 96 model.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Reconstructing B Cell Lineages in the Presence of Context-Dependent Somatic Hypermutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for approximating posterior probabilities of phylogenetic trees and reconstructing ancestral sequences under models of sequence evolution with site-dependence, where standard phylogenetic likelihood computations (pruning) fail. Our approach uses a combined data-augmentation and importance sampling scheme. A key advantage of our approach is the ability to leverage existing highly optimized phylogenetic software. We apply our approach to the reconstruction of B cell receptor affinity maturation lineages from high-throughput repertoire sequencing data and evaluate the impact of incorporating site-dependence on the reconstruction accuracy of both trees and ancestral sequences. We show that accounting for context-dependence during inference always improves the estimates of both ancestral sequences and lineage trees on simulated datasets. We also examine the impact of incorporating priors based on VDJ recombination models, and find that they significantly improve ancestral sequence reconstruction in germline-encoded regions, but increase errors in non-templated nucleotides. We propose a modified, piecewise prior to address this demonstrate that it improves empirical reconstruction accuracy. We apply our approach to the analysis of the HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies DH270 and CH235 which are important targets of current vaccine design efforts.</description>

      <title>Maritime Vessel Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Automatic Identification System (AIS) provides time stamped vessel positions and kinematic reports that enable maritime authorities to monitor traffic. We consider the problem of relabeling AIS trajectories when vessel identifiers are missing, focusing on a challenging nationwide setting in which tracks are heavily downsampled and span diverse operating environments across continental U.S. waters. We propose a hybrid pipeline that first applies a physics-based screening step to project active track endpoints forward in time and select a small set of plausible ancestors for each new observation. A supervised neural classifier then chooses among these candidates, or initiates a new track, using engineered space time and kinematic consistency features. On held out data, this approach improves posit accuracy relative to unsupervised baselines, demonstrating that combining simple motion models with learned disambiguation can scale vessel relabeling to heterogeneous, high volume AIS streams.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression for Uncertainty Quantification: An Introductory Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is essential for the reliable application of computational models in engineering and science. Among surrogate modeling techniques, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is particularly valuable for its non-parametric flexibility and inherent probabilistic output. This paper presents an introductory review of GPR-based methodologies within the context of UQ. We begin with an introduction to UQ and outline its key tasks, including uncertainty propagation, risk estimation, optimization under uncertainty, parameter estimation, and sensitivity analysis. We then introduce Gaussian Processes as a surrogate modeling technique, detailing their formulation, choice of covariance kernels, hyperparameter estimation, and active learning strategies for efficient data acquisition. The tutorial further explores how GPR can be applied to different UQ tasks, including Bayesian quadrature for uncertainty propagation, active learning-based risk estimation, Bayesian optimization for optimization under uncertainty, and surrogate-based sensitivity analysis. Throughout, we emphasize how to leverage the unique formulation of GP for these UQ tasks, rather than simply using it as a standard surrogate model. This work offers a comprehensive guide and unified framework for researchers seeking to rigorously apply probabilistic modeling to complex computational systems.</description>

      <title>Bias-Reduced Estimation of Structural Equation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-sample bias is a pervasive challenge in the estimation of structural equation models (SEMs), especially when sample sizes are small or measurement reliability is low. A range of methods have been proposed to improve finite-sample bias in the SEM literature, ranging from analytic bias corrections to resampling-based techniques, with each carrying trade-offs in scope, computational burden, and statistical performance. We apply the reduced-bias M-estimation framework (RBM, Kosmidis &amp; Lunardon, 2024, J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol.) to SEMs. The RBM framework is attractive as it requires only first- and second-order derivatives of the log-likelihood, which renders it both straightforward to implement, and computationally more efficient compared to resampling-based alternatives such as bootstrap and jackknife. It is also robust to departures from modelling assumptions. Using the same simulation setup as in Dhaene and Rosseel (2022), we illustrate that RBM estimators consistently reduce mean bias in the estimation of SEMs without inflating mean squared error. They also deliver improvements in both median bias and inference relative to maximum likelihood estimators, while maintaining robustness under non-normality. Our findings suggest that RBM offers a promising, practical, and broadly applicable tool for mitigating bias in the estimation of SEMs, particularly in small-sample research contexts.</description>
