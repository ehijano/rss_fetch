      <title>Bonus-malus Systems vs Delays in Claims Reporting and Settlement: Analysis of Ruin Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our paper explores a discrete-time risk model with time-varying premiums, investigating two types of correlated claims: main claims and by-claims. Settlement of the by-claims can be delayed for one time period, representing real-world insurance practices. We examine two premium principles based on reported and settled claims, using recursively computable finite-time ruin probabilities to evaluate the performance of time-varying premiums. Our findings suggest that, under specific assumptions, a higher probability of by-claim settlement delays leads to lower ruin probabilities. Moreover, a stronger correlation between main claims and their associated by-claims results in higher ruin probabilities. Lastly, the premium adjustment principles based on settled claims experience contribute to higher ruin probabilities compared to those based on reported claims experience, assuming all other factors remain constant. Notably, this difference becomes more pronounced when there is a high likelihood of by-claim delays.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Optimization as a Scalable Framework to Characterize Extreme Value Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop distributionally robust optimization (DRO) estimators, specifically for multidimensional Extreme Value Theory (EVT) statistics. EVT supports using semi-parametric models called max-stable distributions built from spatial Poisson point processes. While powerful, these models are only asymptotically valid for large samples. However, since extreme data is by definition scarce, the potential for model misspecification error is inherent to these applications, thus DRO estimators are natural. In order to mitigate over-conservative estimates while enhancing out-of-sample performance, we study DRO estimators informed by semi-parametric max-stable constraints in the space of point processes. We study both tractable convex formulations for some problems of interest (e.g. CVaR) and more general neural network based estimators. Both approaches are validated using synthetically generated data, recovering prescribed characteristics, and verifying the efficacy of the proposed techniques. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to a real data set of financial returns for comparison to a previous analysis. We established the proposed model as a novel formulation in the multivariate EVT domain, and innovative with respect to performance when compared to relevant alternate proposals.</description>

      <title>Spatial Weather, Socio-Economic and Political Risks in Probabilistic Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasts of the impact of spatial weather and pan-European socio-economic and political risks on hourly electricity demand for the mid-term horizon are crucial for strategic decision-making amidst the inherent uncertainty. Most importantly, these forecasts are essential for the operational management of power plants, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and in guiding energy trading and investment decisions. The primary challenge for this forecasting task lies in disentangling the multifaceted drivers of load, which include national deterministic (daily, weekly, annual, and holiday patterns) and national stochastic weather and autoregressive effects. Additionally, transnational stochastic socio-economic and political effects add further complexity, in particular, due to their non-stationarity. To address this challenge, we present an interpretable probabilistic mid-term forecasting model for the hourly load that captures, besides all deterministic effects, the various uncertainties in load. This model recognizes transnational dependencies across 24 European countries, with multivariate modeled socio-economic and political states and cross-country dependent forecasting. Built from interpretable Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), the model enables an analysis of the transmission of each incorporated effect to the hour-specific load. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of countries reliant on electric heating under extreme weather scenarios. This emphasizes the need for high-resolution forecasting of weather effects on pan-European electricity consumption especially in anticipation of widespread electric heating adoption.</description>

      <title>Multinomial Backtesting of Distortion Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06319v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the scope of risk measures for which backtesting models are available by proposing a multinomial backtesting method for general distortion risk measures. The method relies on a stratification and randomization of risk levels. We illustrate the performance of our methods in numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>Testing for the Asymmetric Optimal Hedge Ratios: With an Application to Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing financial risk is of paramount importance to investors, financial institutions, and corporations. Since the pioneering contribution of Johnson (1960), the optimal hedge ratio based on futures is regularly utilized. The current paper suggests an explicit and efficient method for testing the null hypothesis of a symmetric optimal hedge ratio against an asymmetric alternative one within a multivariate setting. If the null is rejected, the position dependent optimal hedge ratios can be estimated via the suggested model. This approach is expected to enhance the accuracy of the implemented hedging strategies compared to the standard methods since it accounts for the fact that the source of risk depends on whether the investor is a buyer or a seller of the risky asset. An application is provided using spot and futures prices of Bitcoin. The results strongly support the view that the optimal hedge ratio for this cryptocurrency is position dependent. The investor that is long in Bitcoin has a much higher conditional optimal hedge ratio compared to the one that is short in the asset. The difference between the two conditional optimal hedge ratios is statistically significant, which has important repercussions for implementing risk management strategies.</description>
