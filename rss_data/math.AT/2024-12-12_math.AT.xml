      <title>The distilled Vietoris Rips filtration for persistent homology and a new memory efficient algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long computational time and large memory requirements for computing Vietoris Rips persistent homology from point clouds remains a significant deterrent to its application to big data. This paper aims to reduce the memory footprint of these computations. It presents a new construction, the distilled Vietoris Rips filtration, and proves that its persistent homology is isomorphic to that of standard Vietoris Rips. The distilled complex is constructed using a discrete Morse vector field defined on the reduced Vietoris Rips complex. The algorithm for building and reducing the distilled filtration boundary matrix is highly parallelisable and memory efficient. It can be implemented for point clouds in any metric space given the pairwise distance matrix.</description>

      <title>Time-optimal persistent homology representatives for univariate time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main methods used in Topological Data Analysis. An active area of research in the field is the study of appropriate notions of PH representatives, which allow to interpret the meaning of the information provided by PH, making it an important problem in the application of PH, and in the study of its interpretability. Computing optimal PH representatives is a problem that is known to be NP-hard, and one is therefore interested in developing context-specific optimality notions that are computable in practice. Here we introduce time-optimal PH representatives for time-varying data, allowing one to extract representatives that are close in time in an appropriate sense. We illustrate our methods on quasi-periodic synthetic time series, as well as time series arising from climate models, and we show that our methods provide optimal PH representatives that are better suited for these types of problems than existing optimality notions, such as length-optimal PH representatives.</description>

      <title>Stolz positive scalar curvature structure groups, proper actions and equivariant 2-types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study equivariant versions of Stolz' R-groups, the positive scalar curvature structure groups $R_n(X)^G$, for proper actions of discrete groups $G$. We define the concept of a fundamental groupoid functor for a $G$-space, encapsulating all the fundamental group information of all the fixed point sets and their relations. We construct classifying spaces for fundamental groupoid functors. As a geometric result, we show that Stolz' equivariant R-group $R_n(X)^G$ depends only on the fundamental groupoid functor of the reference space $X$. The proof covers at the same time in a concise and clear way the classical non-equivariant case.</description>

      <title>Building monomial ideals with fixed betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that as the number of generators of an ideal grows so does the complexity of calculating relations among the generators, this paper identifies collections of monomial ideals with a growing number of generators which have predictable free resolutions. We use elementary collapses from discrete homotopy theory to construct infinitely many monomial ideals, with an arbitrary number of generators, which have similar or the same betti numbers. We show that the Cohen-Macaulay property in each unmixed (pure) component of the ideal is preserved as the ideal is expanded.</description>

      <title>Higher Hochschild homology and exponential functors</title>

      <description>arXiv:1802.07574v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study higher Hochschild homology evaluated on wedges of circles, viewed as a functor on the category of free groups. The main results use coefficients arising from square-zero extensions; this is motivated by work of Turchin and Willwacher in relation to hairy graph cohomology. The functorial point of view allows us to exploit tools such as the theory of polynomial functors and exponential functors. We also introduce and make essential use of the category of outer functors, the full subcategory of functors on free groups on which inner automorphisms act trivially. We give a description of higher Hochschild homology in terms of intrinsically defined polynomial outer functors; we also obtain several explicit computations of these outer functors, working over a field of characteristic zero. In particular, higher Hochschild homology gives a natural source of non-trivial polynomial outer functors.</description>

      <title>Traces for factorization homology in dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.01143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a circle-invariant trace from the factorization homology of the circle $ {\sf trace} \colon \int^\alpha_{{\mathbb S}^1} \\underline{\sf End}(V) \longrightarrow \uno $ associated to a dualizable object $V\in {\boldsymbol{\mathfrak X}}$ in a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category. This proves a conjecture of To\"en--Vezzosi on existence of circle-invariant traces. Underlying our construction is a calculation of the factorization homology over the circle of the walking adjunction in terms of the paracyclic category of Getzler--Jones: $ \int_{{\mathbb S}^1} {\sf Adj} ~\simeq~ {\bDelta_{\circlearrowleft}}^{\triangleleft\!\triangleright} ~. $ This calculation exhibits a form of Poincar\'e duality for 1-dimensional factorization homology.</description>

      <title>String topology on the space of paths with endpoints in a submanifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we consider algebraic structures on the homology of the space of paths in a manifold with endpoints in a submanifold. The Pontryagin-Chas-Sullivan product on the homology of this space had already been investigated by Hingston and Oancea for a particular example. We consider this product as a special case of a more general construction where we consider pullbacks of the path space of a manifold under arbitrary maps. The product on the homology of this space as well as the module structure over the Chas-Sullivan ring are shown to be invariant under homotopies of the respective maps. This in particular implies that the Pontryagin-Chas-Sullivan product as well as the module structure on the space of paths with endpoints in a submanifold are isomorphic for two homotopic embeddings of the submanifold. Moreover, for null-homotopic embeddings of the submanifold this yields nice formulas which we can be used to compute the product and the module structure explicitly. We show that in the case of a null-homotopic embedding the homology of the space of paths with endpoints in a submanifold is even an algebra over the Chas-Sullivan ring. This property does not hold in general as we show with a counterexample.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Laplacians -- a Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent topological Laplacians constitute a new class of tools in topological data analysis (TDA). They are motivated by the necessity to address challenges encountered in persistent homology when handling complex data. These Laplacians combines multiscale analysis with topological techniques to characterize the topological and geometrical features of functions and data. Their kernels fully retrieve the topological invariants of corresponding persistent homology, while their non-harmonic spectra provide supplementary information. Persistent topological Laplacians have demonstrated superior performance over persistent homology in analyzing large-scale protein engineering datasets. In this survey, we offer a pedagogical review of persistent topological Laplacians formulated in various mathematical settings, including simplicial complexes, path complexes, flag complexes, digraphs, hypergraphs, hyperdigraphs, cellular sheaves, as well as $N$-chain complexes.</description>

      <title>Intersection Multiplicity in Loop Spaces and the String Topology Coproduct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string topology coproduct is often perceived as a counterpart in string topology to the Chas-Sullivan product. However, in certain aspects the string topology coproduct is much harder to understand than the Chas-Sullivan product. In particular the coproduct is not homotopy-invariant and it seems much harder to compute. In this article we give an overview over the string topology coproduct and use the notion of intersection multiplicity of homology classes in loop spaces to show that the string topology coproduct and the based string topology coproduct are trivial for certain classes of manifolds. In particular we show that the string topology coproduct vanishes on product manifolds where both factors have vanishing Euler characteristic and we show that the based coproduct is trivial for total spaces of fiber bundles with sections. We also discuss implications of these results.</description>

      <title>On The Telescopic Picard Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for any prime $p$ and height $n \ge 1$, the telescopic Picard group $\mathrm{Pic}(\mathrm{Sp}_{Tn})$ contains a subgroup of the form $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}/a_p(p^n-1)$, where $a_p = 1$ if $p = 2$ and $a_p = 2$ if $p$ is odd. Using Kummer theory, we obtain an $(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}^\times \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/n)$-Galois extension of $\mathbb{S}_{T(n)}$, obtaining the first example of a lift of a non-Abelian Galois extension of the $K(n)$-local sphere to the telescopic world, at arbitrary positive height and prime. Our proof proceeds by setting up a higher categorical framework for the periodicity theorem, utilizing the symmetries of this framework to construct Picard elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that various combinatorial invariants of matroids such as Chow rings and Orlik--Solomon algebras may be assembled into "operad-like" structures. Specifically, one obtains several operads over a certain Feynman category which we introduce and study in detail. In addition, we establish a Koszul-type duality between Chow rings and Orlik--Solomon algebras, vastly generalizing a celebrated result of Getzler. This provides a new interpretation of combinatorial Leray models of Orlik--Solomon algebras.</description>

      <title>Local characterization of block-decomposability for multiparameter persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16624v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local conditions for the direct summands of a persistence module to belong to a certain class of indecomposables have been proposed in the 2-parameter setting, notably for the class of indecomposables called block modules, which plays a prominent role in levelset persistence. Here we generalize the local condition for decomposability into block modules to the n-parameter setting, and prove a corresponding structure theorem. Our result holds in the generality of pointwise finite-dimensional modules over finite products of arbitrary totally ordered sets. Our proof extends the one by Botnan and Crawley-Boevey from 2 to n parameters, which requires some crucial adaptations at places where their proof is fundamentally tied to the 2-parameter setting.</description>

      <title>Approaches to critical point theory via sequential and parametrized topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space was introduced to obtain a lower bound on the number of critical points of a $C^1$-function on a given manifold. Related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and motivated by topological robotics, the topological complexity (TC) of a space is a numerical homotopy invariant whose topological properties are an active field of research. The notions of sequential and parametrized topological complexity extend the ideas of topological complexity. While the definition of TC is closely related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, the connections of sequential and parametrized TC to critical point theory have not been fully explored yet. In this article we apply methods from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory to establish various lower bounds on numbers of critical points of functions in terms of sequential and parametrized TCs. We carry out several consequences and applications of these bounds, among them a computation of the parametrized TC of the unit tangent bundles of $(4m-1)$-spheres.</description>
