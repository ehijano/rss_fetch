      <title>Analytical Traces on Coulomb Branches of Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an explicit construction of twisted traces for quantum Coulomb branches of conical theories. We develop an operator representation of the Coulomb branch algebra and use it to derive integral formulas for the twisted trace. Our construction provides a concrete realization of twisted traces that arise as the correlation functions of a conformal field theory, particularly in the work of Beem, Peelaers, and Rastelli. This complements recent developments in the study of twisted traces on quantum Higgs branches and offers new mathematical insights into the structure of quantum Coulomb branches.</description>

      <title>Local characters of mod-$\ell$ representations of a $p$-adic reductive group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the ``lifted character'' of mod-$\ell$ representations of $p$-adic reductive groups where $\ell\not=p$, on compact elements with pro-orders not divisible by $\ell$. We generalize the local character expansion results of Howe, Harish-Chandra and DeBacker to such lifted characters. We show that the result of Moeglin-Waldspurger and Varma on degenerate Whittaker models is valid for the character expansion.</description>

      <title>Local character expansion for mod-$\ell$ representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a $p$-adic reductive group with $p$ ``very large.'' For any irreducible admissible representation $\pi$ of $G$ over an algebraically closed field $C$ of characteristic $\not=p$, we define a ``local character expansion'' of $\pi$ with coefficients $c_{\mathcal{O}}(\pi)\in\mathbb{Q}$, that does not use the character of $\pi$ directly but instead use the multiplicities of degenerate Moy-Prasad types. Note that the existence of local character expansion for mod-$\ell$ representations is shown by another paper of the author using a different and quicker method.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb categories with coloured regions and Jones-Wenzl projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalised Temperley-Lieb categories with regions labelled by elements of a commutative algebra were introduced by M. Khovanov and the second author in [Pure Appl. Math. Q. 19 (2023), no. 5]. We consider the case where the regions are labelled by colours, corresponding to a complete set of orthogonal idempotents of a semisimple commutative algebra. We determine when these generalised Temperley-Lieb categories are semisimple and find the direct sum decompositions of tensor products of simple objects. As the main tool we introduce two-variable versions of Chebychev polynomials and construct analogues of Jones-Wenzl projectors. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of M. Khovanov and the second author on Gram determinants and non-degeneracy of trace pairings for the associated Temperley-Lieb algebras with coloured regions.</description>

      <title>Serre functor and torsion pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ in an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ and its Happel-Reiten-Smal{\o} tilt $\mathcal{B}$, the equivalence of the realization functor $D^b({\mathcal B})\to D^b({\mathcal A})$ is determined by some properties of the torsion pair [9]. We call $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ satisfying such a property effaceable. If $\mathcal{A}$ is an Ext-finite abelian category with Serre duality, we prove that $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ is effaceable implies that $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal T}$ is closed under Serre functor. Conversely, when $\mathcal A$ is the module category of a finite-dimensional hereditary algebra, we prove that the torsion pair $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ is effaceable if and only if $\mathcal{U}_\mathcal{T}$ is closed under the Serre functor via a recollement of $D^b({\mathcal A})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the depth-zero supercuspidal $L$-packets of $\mathrm{SL}_2(F)$ where $F$ is a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. We compare the explicit endoscopic character identities for $\mathrm{SL}_2(F)$ with the classical character formulas of Sally-Shalika. Our main result concerns the supercuspidal $L$-packet of size $4$. For this $L$-packet, we show how the norm $1$ groups $H_1, H_2, H_3$ in the three quadratic extensions of $F$ play a crucial role in the endoscopic character identities for $\mathrm{SL}_2(F)$.</description>

      <title>A Construction of the Symmetric Monoidal Structure of the Geometric Whittaker Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ and let $\ell$ be a prime number different from $p$. Let $U \subseteq G$ be a maximal unipotent subgroup, $T$ a maximal torus normalizing $U$ and $W$ the Weyl group of $G$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a non-degenerate multiplicative $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell} $-local system on $U$. R. Bezrukavnikov and the second author have proved that the bi-Whittaker category, namely the triangulated monoidal category of $(U, \mathcal{L})$-biequivariant $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell}$-complexes on $G$ is monoidally equivalent to an explicit thick triangulated monoidal subcategory $\mathscr{D}_{W}^{\circ}(T) \subseteq \mathscr{D}_{W}(T)$ of "central sheaves" on the torus. In particular it has the structure of a symmetric monoidal category coming from the symmetric monoidal structure on $\mathscr{D}_W(T)$.
  In this paper, we give another construction of a symmetric monoidal structure on the above category and prove that it agrees with the one coming from the above construction. For this, among other things, we generalize a proof by Gelfand for finite groups to the geometric setup.</description>

      <title>The quiver with superpotentials of a $d$-angulation of a marked surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we associate a quiver with superpotential to each $d$-angulation of a (unpunctured) marked surface. We show that, under quasi-isomorphisms, the flip of a $d$-angulation is compatible with Oppermann's mutation of (the Ginzburg algebra of) the corresponding quiver with superpotential, thereby partially generalizing the result in [LF09]. Applying to the generalized $(d-2)$-cluster categories associated to this quiver with superpotential, we prove that some certain almost complete $(d-2)$-cluster tilting objects in the higher cluster category have exactly $d-1$ complements.</description>

      <title>Double Poisson (vertex) algebra cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A noncommutative (NC) version of Poisson geometry was initiated by Van den Bergh by introducing at the level of associative algebras the formalism of double Poisson brackets. Their key property is to induce (standard) Poisson brackets under each representation functor. Then, Pichereau and Van de Weyer developed and studied the corresponding cohomology theory under the assumption that there exists a NC bivector defining the double Poisson bracket. Our first main result is that one can remove this assumption by constructing a completed double Poisson cohomology valid in any situation, hence generalizing the approach of Pichereau-Van de Weyer. As an application, we show that the double Poisson cohomology complex associated to the path algebra of a quiver is acyclic. Furthermore, we show that this new double Poisson cohomology theory can be adapted to weaker forms of double Poisson brackets (called quasi-Poisson and gauged Poisson), and that it is compatible with representation functors. A second focus of this memoir concerns the formalism of double Poisson vertex algebras. These were introduced by De Sole, Kac and the second author, as NC versions of Poisson vertex algebras, which induce the latter structures under each representation functor. Our second main result is the development of cohomology theories for double Poisson vertex algebras. These are NC analogues of the basic, reduced and variational Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies. More importantly, we prove that under each representation functor these cohomology theories are compatible with their commutative counterparts. As an application, we compute the double Poisson vertex algebra cohomology of the generalized NC de Rham complex and of the generalized NC variational complex. Finally, we describe the relation between the double Poisson algebra and double Poisson vertex algebra cohomologies using jet and quotient functors.</description>

      <title>On RoCK blocks of double covers of symmetric and alternating groups and the refined Brou\'e conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02147v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that these RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for these RoCK blocks.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Descriptions of Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convex sets arising in a variety of applications are well-defined for every relevant dimension. Examples include the simplex and the spectraplex that correspond to probability distributions and to quantum states; combinatorial polytopes and their relaxations such as the cut polytope and the elliptope in integer programming; and unit balls of regularizers such as the $\ell_p$ and Schatten norms in inverse problems. Moreover, these sets are often specified using conic descriptions that can be obviously instantiated in any dimension. We develop a systematic framework to study such dimension-free descriptions of convex sets. We show that dimension-free descriptions arise from a recently-identified phenomenon in algebraic topology called representation stability, which relates invariants across dimensions in a sequence of group representations. Our framework yields structural results for dimension-free descriptions pertaining to the relations between the sets they describe across dimensions, extendability of a single set in a given dimension to a freely-described sequence, and continuous limits of such sequences. We also develop a procedure to obtain parametric families of freely-described convex sets whose structure is adapted to a given application; illustrations are provided via examples that arise in the literature as well as new families that are derived using our procedure. We demonstrate the utility of our framework in two contexts. First, we develop an algorithm for a dimension-free analog of the convex regression problem, where a convex function is fit to input-output data; by searching over our parametric families, we can fit a function to low-dimensional inputs and extend it to any other dimension. Second, we prove that many sequences of symmetric conic programs can be solved in constant time, which unifies and strengthens several results in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We develop a Gauss decomposition approach to establish a Drinfeld type current presentation for Olshanski's twisted Yangians associated to the orthogonal Lie algebras (also called twisted Yangians of type AI), settling a longstanding open problem.

      <title>Word Measures on Wreath Products II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every word $w$ in $F_r$, the free group of rank $r$, induces a probability measure (the $w$-measure) on every finite group $G$, by substitution of random $G$-elements in the letters. This measure is determined by its Fourier coefficients: the $w$-expectations $E_w[\chi]$ of the irreducible characters of $G$. For every finite group $G$, every stable character $\chi$ of $G\wr S_n$ (trace of a finitely generated $FI_G$-module), and every word $w\in F_r$, we approximate $E_w[\chi]$ up to an error term of $O(n^{-\pi(w)})$, where $\pi(w)$ is the primitivity rank of $w$. This generalizes previous works by Puder, Hanany, Magee and the author. As an application we show that random Schreier graphs of representation-stable actions of $G\wr S_n$ are close-to-optimal expanders. The paper reveals a surprising relation between stable representation theory of wreath products and not-necessarily connected Stallings core graphs.</description>
