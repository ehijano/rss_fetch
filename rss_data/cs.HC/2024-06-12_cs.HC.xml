      <title>Co-designing a Child-Robot Relational Norm Intervention to Regulate Children's Handwriting Posture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persuasive social robots employ their social influence to modulate children's behaviours in child-robot interaction. In this work, we introduce the Child-Robot Relational Norm Intervention (CRNI) model, leveraging the passive role of social robots and children's reluctance to inconvenience others to influence children's behaviours. Unlike traditional persuasive strategies that employ robots in active roles, CRNI utilizes an indirect approach by generating a disturbance for the robot in response to improper child behaviours, thereby motivating behaviour change through the avoidance of norm violations. The feasibility of CRNI is explored with a focus on improving children's handwriting posture. To this end, as a preliminary work, we conducted two participatory design workshops with 12 children and 1 teacher to identify effective disturbances that can promote posture correction.</description>

      <title>"It answers questions that I didn't know I had": Ph.D. Students' Evaluation of an Information Sharing Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary PhD programs can be challenging as the vital information needed by students may not be readily available, it is scattered across university's websites, while tacit knowledge can be obtained only by interacting with people. Hence, there is a need to develop a knowledge management model to create, query, and maintain a knowledge repository for interdisciplinary students. We propose a knowledge graph containing information on critical categories and their relationships, extracted from multiple sources, essential for interdisciplinary PhD students. This study evaluates the usability of a participatory designed knowledge graph intended to facilitate information exchange and decision-making. The usability findings demonstrate that interaction with this knowledge graph benefits PhD students by notably reducing uncertainty and academic stress, particularly among newcomers. Knowledge graph supported them in decision making, especially when choosing collaborators in an interdisciplinary setting. Key helpful features are related to exploring student faculty networks, milestones tracking, rapid access to aggregated data, and insights into crowdsourced fellow students' activities. The knowledge graph provides a solution to meet the personalized needs of doctoral researchers and has the potential to improve the information discovery and decision-making process substantially. It also includes the tacit knowledge exchange support missing from most current approaches, which is critical for this population and establishing interdisciplinary collaborations. This approach can be applied to other interdisciplinary programs and domains globally.</description>

      <title>Harnessing GenAI for Higher Education: A Study of a Retrieval Augmented Generation Chatbot's Impact on Human Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for enhancing human learning. This study introduces Professor Leodar, a custom-built, Singlish-speaking Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to enhance educational support for undergraduate engineering students. Deployed at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Professor Leodar offers a glimpse into the future of AI-assisted learning, offering personalized guidance, 24/7 availability, and contextually relevant information. Through a mixed-methods approach, we uncover the impact of Professor Leodar on student learning, engagement, and exam preparedness, with 97.1% of participants reporting positive experiences. These findings help define possible roles of AI in education and highlight the potential of custom GenAI chatbots. Our combination of chatbot development, in-class deployment and study of learning outcomes offers a benchmark for GenAI educational tools and serves as stepping stone for redefining the interplay between AI and human learning.</description>

      <title>Visual instrument co-design embracing the unique movement capabilities of a dancer with physical disability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the design of an expressive visual instrument that embraces the unique movement style of a dancer living with physical disability. Through a collaboration between the dancer and an interaction designer/visual artist, the creative qualities of wearable devices for motion tracking are investigated, with emphasis on integrating the dancer's specific movement capabilities with their creative goals. The affordances of this technology for imagining new forms of creative expression play a critical role in the design process. These themes are drawn together through an experiential performance which augments an improvised dance with an ephemeral real-time visualisation of the performer's movements. Through practice-based research, the design, development and presentation of this performance work is examined as a 'testbed' for new ideas, allowing for the exploration of HCI concepts within a creative context. This paper outlines the creative process behind the development of the work, the insights derived from the practice-based research enquiry, and the role of movement technology in encouraging new ways of moving through creative expression.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Imperceptible Threshold for Color Vibration Pairs Selected by using MacAdam Ellipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method for searching for color vibration pairs that are imperceptible to the human eye based on the MacAdam ellipse, an experimentally determined color-difference range that is indistinguishable to the human eye. We created color pairs by selecting eight colors within the sRGB color space specified by the ellipse, and conducted experiments to confirm the threshold of the amplitude of color vibration amplitude at which flicker becomes imperceptible to the human eye. The experimental results indicate a general guideline for acceptable amplitudes for pair selection.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI improves task performance in human-AI collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) provides considerable opportunities to assist human work. However, one crucial challenge of human-AI collaboration is that many AI algorithms operate in a black-box manner where the way how the AI makes predictions remains opaque. This makes it difficult for humans to validate a prediction made by AI against their own domain knowledge. For this reason, we hypothesize that augmenting humans with explainable AI as a decision aid improves task performance in human-AI collaboration. To test this hypothesis, we analyze the effect of augmenting domain experts with explainable AI in the form of visual heatmaps. We then compare participants that were either supported by (a) black-box AI or (b) explainable AI, where the latter supports them to follow AI predictions when the AI is accurate or overrule the AI when the AI predictions are wrong. We conducted two preregistered experiments with representative, real-world visual inspection tasks from manufacturing and medicine. The first experiment was conducted with factory workers from an electronics factory, who performed $N=9,600$ assessments of whether electronic products have defects. The second experiment was conducted with radiologists, who performed $N=5,650$ assessments of chest X-ray images to identify lung lesions. The results of our experiments with domain experts performing real-world tasks show that task performance improves when participants are supported by explainable AI instead of black-box AI. For example, in the manufacturing setting, we find that augmenting participants with explainable AI (as opposed to black-box AI) leads to a five-fold decrease in the median error rate of human decisions, which gives a significant improvement in task performance.</description>

      <title>SonicID: User Identification on Smart Glasses with Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart glasses have become more prevalent as they provide an increasing number of applications for users. They store various types of private information or can access it via connections established with other devices. Therefore, there is a growing need for user identification on smart glasses. In this paper, we introduce a low-power and minimally-obtrusive system called SonicID, designed to authenticate users on glasses. SonicID extracts unique biometric information from users by scanning their faces with ultrasonic waves and utilizes this information to distinguish between different users, powered by a customized binary classifier with the ResNet-18 architecture. SonicID can authenticate users within 0.12 seconds, with an energy consumption of 19.8 mAs per trial. A user study involving 24 participants confirms that SonicID achieves a true positive rate of 96.5%, a false positive rate of 4.1%, and a balanced accuracy of 96.2% using just 4 minutes of training data collected for each new user. This performance is relatively consistent across different remounting sessions and days. Given this promising performance, we further discuss the potential applications of SonicID and methods to improve its performance in the future.</description>

      <title>Designing Child-Centered Content Exposure and Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on children's online experience and computer interaction often overlooks the relationship children have with hidden algorithms that control the content they encounter. Furthermore, it is not only about how children interact with targeted content but also how their development and agency are largely affected by these. By engaging with the body of literature at the intersection of i) human-centered design approaches, ii) exclusion and discrimination in A.I., iii) privacy, transparency, and accountability, and iv) children's online citizenship, this article dives into the question of "How can we approach the design of a child-centered moderation process to (1) include aspects that families value for their children and (2) provide explanations for content appropriateness and removal so that we can scale (according to systems and human needs) the moderation process assisted by A.I.?".
  This article contributes a sociotechnical highlight of core challenges and opportunities of designing child-centered content control tools. The article concludes by grounding and characterizing design considerations for a child-centered, family-guided moderation system. We hope this work serves as a stepping stone for designers and researchers pursuing children's safety online with an eye on hidden agents controlling children's online experiences and, by extension, the values and opportunities children are exposed to.</description>

      <title>ORES-Inspect: A technology probe for machine learning audits on enwiki</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditing the machine learning (ML) models used on Wikipedia is important for ensuring that vandalism-detection processes remain fair and effective. However, conducting audits is challenging because stakeholders have diverse priorities and assembling evidence for a model's [in]efficacy is technically complex. We designed an interface to enable editors to learn about and audit the performance of the ORES edit quality model. ORES-Inspect is an open-source web tool and a provocative technology probe for researching how editors think about auditing the many ML models used on Wikipedia. We describe the design of ORES-Inspect and our plans for further research with this system.</description>

      <title>UICoder: Finetuning Large Language Models to Generate User Interface Code through Automated Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to consistently generate UI code that compiles and produces visually relevant designs. Existing approaches to improve generation rely on expensive human feedback or distilling a proprietary model. In this paper, we explore the use of automated feedback (compilers and multi-modal models) to guide LLMs to generate high-quality UI code. Our method starts with an existing LLM and iteratively produces improved models by self-generating a large synthetic dataset using an original model, applying automated tools to aggressively filter, score, and de-duplicate the data into a refined higher quality dataset. The original LLM is improved by finetuning on this refined dataset. We applied our approach to several open-source LLMs and compared the resulting performance to baseline models with both automated metrics and human preferences. Our evaluation shows the resulting models outperform all other downloadable baselines and approach the performance of larger proprietary models.</description>

      <title>Collective Constitutional AI: Aligning a Language Model with Public Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing consensus that language model (LM) developers should not be the sole deciders of LM behavior, creating a need for methods that enable the broader public to collectively shape the behavior of LM systems that affect them. To address this need, we present Collective Constitutional AI (CCAI): a multi-stage process for sourcing and integrating public input into LMs-from identifying a target population to sourcing principles to training and evaluating a model. We demonstrate the real-world practicality of this approach by creating what is, to our knowledge, the first LM fine-tuned with collectively sourced public input and evaluating this model against a baseline model trained with established principles from a LM developer. Our quantitative evaluations demonstrate several benefits of our approach: the CCAI-trained model shows lower bias across nine social dimensions compared to the baseline model, while maintaining equivalent performance on language, math, and helpful-harmless evaluations. Qualitative comparisons of the models suggest that the models differ on the basis of their respective constitutions, e.g., when prompted with contentious topics, the CCAI-trained model tends to generate responses that reframe the matter positively instead of a refusal. These results demonstrate a promising, tractable pathway toward publicly informed development of language models.</description>

      <title>Let's Go Real Talk: Spoken Dialogue Model for Face-to-Face Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel Face-to-Face spoken dialogue model. It processes audio-visual speech from user input and generates audio-visual speech as the response, marking the initial step towards creating an avatar chatbot system without relying on intermediate text. To this end, we newly introduce MultiDialog, the first large-scale multimodal (i.e., audio and visual) spoken dialogue corpus containing 340 hours of approximately 9,000 dialogues, recorded based on the open domain dialogue dataset, TopicalChat. The MultiDialog contains parallel audio-visual recordings of conversation partners acting according to the given script with emotion annotations, which we expect to open up research opportunities in multimodal synthesis. Our Face-to-Face spoken dialogue model incorporates a textually pretrained large language model and adapts it into the audio-visual spoken dialogue domain by incorporating speech-text joint pretraining. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our model in facilitating a face-to-face conversation. Demo and data are available at https://multidialog.github.io and https://huggingface.co/datasets/IVLLab/MultiDialog, respectively.</description>

      <title>Designing a Dashboard for Transparency and Control of Conversational AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational LLMs function as black box systems, leaving users guessing about why they see the output they do. This lack of transparency is potentially problematic, especially given concerns around bias and truthfulness. To address this issue, we present an end-to-end prototype-connecting interpretability techniques with user experience design-that seeks to make chatbots more transparent. We begin by showing evidence that a prominent open-source LLM has a "user model": examining the internal state of the system, we can extract data related to a user's age, gender, educational level, and socioeconomic status. Next, we describe the design of a dashboard that accompanies the chatbot interface, displaying this user model in real time. The dashboard can also be used to control the user model and the system's behavior. Finally, we discuss a study in which users conversed with the instrumented system. Our results suggest that users appreciate seeing internal states, which helped them expose biased behavior and increased their sense of control. Participants also made valuable suggestions that point to future directions for both design and machine learning research.

      <title>100 Drivers, 2200 km: A Natural Dataset of Driving Style toward Human-centered Intelligent Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective driving style analysis is critical to developing human-centered intelligent driving systems that consider drivers' preferences. However, the approaches and conclusions of most related studies are diverse and inconsistent because no unified datasets tagged with driving styles exist as a reliable benchmark. The absence of explicit driving style labels makes verifying different approaches and algorithms difficult. This paper provides a new benchmark by constructing a natural dataset of Driving Style (100-DrivingStyle) tagged with the subjective evaluation of 100 drivers' driving styles. In this dataset, the subjective quantification of each driver's driving style is from themselves and an expert according to the Likert-scale questionnaire. The testing routes are selected to cover various driving scenarios, including highways, urban, highway ramps, and signalized traffic. The collected driving data consists of lateral and longitudinal manipulation information, including steering angle, steering speed, lateral acceleration, throttle position, throttle rate, brake pressure, etc. This dataset is the first to provide detailed manipulation data with driving-style tags, and we demonstrate its benchmark function using six classifiers. The 100-DrivingStyle dataset is available via https://github.com/chaopengzhang/100-DrivingStyle-Dataset</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Realisation of an Information Need: An EEG Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the foundational goals of Information Retrieval (IR) is to satisfy searchers' Information Needs (IN). Understanding how INs physically manifest has long been a complex and elusive process. However, recent studies utilising Electroencephalography (EEG) data have provided real-time insights into the neural processes associated with INs. Unfortunately, they have yet to demonstrate how this insight can practically benefit the search experience. As such, within this study, we explore the ability to predict the realisation of IN within EEG data across 14 subjects whilst partaking in a Question-Answering (Q/A) task. Furthermore, we investigate the combinations of EEG features that yield optimal predictive performance, as well as identify regions within the Q/A queries where a subject's realisation of IN is more pronounced. The findings from this work demonstrate that EEG data is sufficient for the real-time prediction of the realisation of an IN across all subjects with an accuracy of 73.5\% (SD 2.6\%) and on a per-subject basis with an accuracy of 90.1\% (SD 22.1\%). This work helps to close the gap by bridging theoretical neuroscientific advancements with tangible improvements in information retrieval practices, paving the way for real-time prediction of the realisation of IN.</description>

      <title>MobileAgentBench: An Efficient and User-Friendly Benchmark for Mobile LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based mobile agents are increasingly popular due to their capability to interact directly with mobile phone Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) and their potential to autonomously manage daily tasks. Despite their promising prospects in both academic and industrial sectors, little research has focused on benchmarking the performance of existing mobile agents, due to the inexhaustible states of apps and the vague definition of feasible action sequences. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient and user-friendly benchmark, MobileAgentBench, designed to alleviate the burden of extensive manual testing. We initially define 100 tasks across 10 open-source apps, categorized by multiple levels of difficulty. Subsequently, we evaluate several existing mobile agents, including AppAgent and MobileAgent, to thoroughly and systematically compare their performance. All materials are accessible on our project webpage: https://MobileAgentBench.github.io, contributing to the advancement of both academic and industrial fields.</description>

      <title>A Sociotechnical Lens for Evaluating Computer Vision Models: A Case Study on Detecting and Reasoning about Gender and Emotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of computer vision (CV) technologies, the automatic detection and interpretation of gender and emotion in images is a critical area of study. This paper investigates social biases in CV models, emphasizing the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. These metrics often fall short in capturing the complexities of gender and emotion, which are fluid and culturally nuanced constructs. Our study proposes a sociotechnical framework for evaluating CV models, incorporating both technical performance measures and considerations of social fairness. Using a dataset of 5,570 images related to vaccination and climate change, we empirically compared the performance of various CV models, including traditional models like DeepFace and FER, and generative models like GPT-4 Vision. Our analysis involved manually validating the gender and emotional expressions in a subset of images to serve as benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while GPT-4 Vision outperforms other models in technical accuracy for gender classification, it exhibits discriminatory biases, particularly in response to transgender and non-binary personas. Furthermore, the model's emotion detection skew heavily towards positive emotions, with a notable bias towards associating female images with happiness, especially when prompted by male personas. These findings underscore the necessity of developing more comprehensive evaluation criteria that address both validity and discriminatory biases in CV models. Our proposed framework provides guidelines for researchers to critically assess CV tools, ensuring their application in communication research is both ethical and effective. The significant contribution of this study lies in its emphasis on a sociotechnical approach, advocating for CV technologies that support social good and mitigate biases rather than perpetuate them.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Generative AI Chatbots for Multiethnic Communities in Disaster Preparedness Communication: Extending the CASA Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is among the first to develop different prototypes of generative AI (GenAI) chatbots powered by GPT 4 to communicate hurricane preparedness information to diverse residents. Drawing from the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm and the literature on disaster vulnerability and cultural tailoring, this study conducted a between-subjects experiment with 441 Black, Hispanic, and Caucasian residents of Florida. A computational analysis of chat logs (N = 7,848) shows that anthropomorphism and personalization are key communication topics in GenAI chatbot-user interactions. SEM results (N = 441) suggest that GenAI chatbots varying in tone formality and cultural tailoring significantly predict bot perceptions and, subsequently, hurricane preparedness outcomes. These results highlight the potential of using GenAI chatbots to improve diverse communities' disaster preparedness.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Unravelling Local Government Data Sharing Barriers in Estonia and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estonia's digital government success has received global acclaim, yet its Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives, especially at the local level, encounter persistent challenges. Despite significant progress of national OGD initiative in OGD rankings, local governments lag in OGD provision. This study aims to examine barriers hindering municipalities from openly sharing OGD. Employing a qualitative approach through interviews with Estonian municipalities and drawing on the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model, the study sheds light on barriers impeding OGD sharing. Practical recommendations are proposed to bridge the gap between national policies and local implementation, including enhancing awareness, improving data governance frameworks, and fostering collaboration be-tween local and national authorities. By addressing overlooked weaknesses in the Estonian open data ecosystem and providing actionable recommendations, this research contributes to a more resilient and sustainable open data ecosystem. Additionally, by validating the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model and proposing a revised version tailored for local government contexts, the study advances theoretical frameworks for understanding data sharing resistance. Ultimately, this study serves as a call to action for policymakers and practitioners to prioritize local OGD initiatives.</description>

      <title>A TDM-based Analog Front-End for Ear-EEG Recording with 74.5-G{\Omega} Input Impedance, 384-mV DC Tolerance and 0.27-{\mu}Vrms Input-Referred Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the design of a time-division multiplexed capacitively-coupled chopper analog front-end (AFE) with a novel impedance boost loop (IBL) and a novel DC servo loop (DSL). The proposed IBL has two impedance booting loops for compensating leakage current due to parasitic capacitance from the ESD pad and external interconnections, and the chopper. By shifting the compensation node from the feedback pathway to the amplifier's inputs, this work realizes a higher-resolution compensation, boosting the input impedance of the AFE to several tens of G{\Omega}. The proposed DSL consists of a coarse DSL driven by DC supply voltages and a fine DSL driven by five phase-interleaving pulse-width modulated waveforms (PI-PWM). Avoiding the usage of delta-sigma CDAC, the energy efficiency is better than conventional DSLs. Designed in a 0.18-{\mu}m CMOS process, the AFE consumes 4.5 {\mu}A from a 1.2-V supply. The simulated input referred noise is 0.27 {\mu}Vrms from 0.5 to 100 Hz in the presence of a 384-mV EDO. With a 10-pF parasitic capacitance, the proposed AFE achieves an input impedance of more than 74.5 G{\Omega} at 1 Hz and 6.4 G{\Omega} at 50 Hz. The simulation results have been robust under 100 Monte-Carlo samples.</description>
