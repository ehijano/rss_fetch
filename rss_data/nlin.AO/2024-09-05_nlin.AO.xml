      <title>Power-grid modelling via gradual improvement of parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of electric power systems are widely studied through the phase synchronization of oscillators, typically with the use of the Kuramoto equation. While there are numerous well-known order parameters to characterize these dynamics, shortcoming of these metrics are also recognized. To capture all transitions from phase disordered states over phase locking to fully synchronized systems, new metrics were proposed and demonstrated on homogeneous models. In this paper we aim to address a gap in the literature, namely, to examine how gradual improvement of power grid models affect the goodness of certain metrics. To study how the details of models are perceived by the different metrics, 12 variations of a power grid model were created, introducing varying level of heterogeneity through the coupling strength, the nodal powers and the moment of inertia. The grid models were compared using a second-order Kuramoto equation and adaptive Runge-Kutta solver, measuring the values of the phase, the frequency and the universal order parameters. Finally, frequency results of the models were compared to grid measurements. We found that the universal order parameter was able to capture more details of the grid models, especially in cases of decreasing moment of inertia. The most heterogeneous models showed very low synchronization and thus suggest a limitation of the second-order Kuramoto equation. Finally, we show local frequency results related to the multi-peaks of static models, which implies that spatial heterogeneity can also induce such multi-peak behavior.</description>

      <title>Regulatory Functions from Cells to Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulatory functions are essential in both socioeconomic and biological systems, from corporate managers to regulatory genes in genomes. Regulatory functions come with substantial costs, but are often taken for granted. Here, we empirically examine regulatory costs across diverse systems -- biological organisms (bacteria and eukaryotic genomes), human organizations (companies, federal agencies, universities), and decentralized entities (Wikipedia, cities) -- using scaling analysis. We guide the empirical analysis with a conceptual model, which anticipates the scaling of regulatory costs to shift with the system's internal interaction structure -- well-mixed or modular. We find diverse systems exhibit consistent scaling patterns -- well-mixed systems exhibit superlinear scaling, while modular ones show sublinear or linear scaling. Further, we find that the socioeconomic systems containing more diverse occupational functions tend to have more regulatory costs than expected from their size, confirming the type of interactions also plays a role in regulatory costs. While many socioeconomic systems exhibit efficiencies of scale, regulatory costs in many social systems have grown disproportionally over time. Our finding suggests that the increasing complexity of functions may contribute to this trend. This cross-system comparison offers a framework for understanding regulatory costs and could guide future efforts to identify and mitigate regulatory inefficiencies.</description>

      <title>Pinning control of chimera states in systems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind synchronization phenomena is of paramount importance in nonlinear science. In particular, chimera states, patterns in which order and disorder coexist simultaneously, continue to puzzle scholars, due to their elusive nature. Recently, it has been shown that higher-order interactions greatly promote the onset of chimera states, which are easier to found and more resilient when the system units interact in group. In this work, we show that the higher-order framework is fertile not only for the emergence of chimera states, but also for their control. Via pinning control, a technique consisting in applying a forcing to a subset of the nodes, we are able to trigger the emergence of chimera states with only a small fraction of controlled nodes, at striking contrast with the case without higher-order interactions. We show that our setting is robust for different higher-order topologies and types of pinning control and, finally, we give a heuristic interpretation of the results via phase reduction theory. Our numerical and theoretical results provide further understanding on how higher-order interactions shape nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Segregation in binary mixture with differential contraction among active rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell cortex contraction is essential for shaping cells, enabling movement, ensuring proper division, maintaining tissue integrity, guiding development, and responding to mechanical signals - all critical for the life and health of multicellular organisms. Differential contractions in cell membranes, particularly when cells of different types interact, play a crucial role in the emergence of segregation. In this study, we introduce a model where rings composed of active particles interact through differential membrane contraction within a specified cutoff distance. We demonstrate that segregation arises solely from differential contraction, with the activity of the rings functioning similarly to an effective temperature. Additionally, we observed that segregation involves cluster fusion-diffusion process. However, the decay exponent of the segregation parameter we found is close to $\lambda \sim -1/3$, which differs from the $\lambda \sim -1/4$ predicted by previous theoretical approaches and simulations.</description>

      <title>Simple fusion-fission quantifies Israel-Palestine violence and suggests multi-adversary solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why humans fight has no easy answer. However, understanding better how humans fight could inform future interventions, hidden shifts and casualty risk. Fusion-fission describes the well-known grouping behavior of fish etc. fighting for survival in the face of strong opponents: they form clusters ('fusion') which provide collective benefits and a cluster scatters when it senses danger ('fission'). Here we show how similar clustering (fusion-fission) of human fighters provides a unified quantitative explanation for complex casualty patterns across decades of Israel-Palestine region violence, as well as the October 7 surprise attack -- and uncovers a hidden post-October 7 shift. State-of-the-art data shows this fighter fusion-fission in action. It also predicts future 'super-shock' attacks that will be more lethal than October 7 and will arrive earlier. It offers a multi-adversary solution. Our results -- which include testable formulae and a plug-and-play simulation -- enable concrete risk assessments of future casualties and policy-making grounded by fighter behavior.</description>
