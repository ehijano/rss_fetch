      <title>Kernel shape renormalization explains output-output correlations in finite Bayesian one-hidden-layer networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-width one hidden layer networks with multiple neurons in the readout layer display non-trivial output-output correlations that vanish in the lazy-training infinite-width limit. In this manuscript we leverage recent progress in the proportional limit of Bayesian deep learning (that is the limit where the size of the training set $P$ and the width of the hidden layers $N$ are taken to infinity keeping their ratio $\alpha = P/N$ finite) to rationalize this empirical evidence. In particular, we show that output-output correlations in finite fully-connected networks are taken into account by a kernel shape renormalization of the infinite-width NNGP kernel, which naturally arises in the proportional limit. We perform accurate numerical experiments both to assess the predictive power of the Bayesian framework in terms of generalization, and to quantify output-output correlations in finite-width networks. By quantitatively matching our predictions with the observed correlations, we provide additional evidence that kernel shape renormalization is instrumental to explain the phenomenology observed in finite Bayesian one hidden layer networks.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of directed networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed networks are essential for representing complex systems, capturing the asymmetry of interactions in fields such as neuroscience, transportation, and social networks. Directionality reveals how influence, information, or resources flow within a network, fundamentally shaping the behavior of dynamical processes and distinguishing directed networks from their undirected counterparts. Robust null models are crucial for identifying meaningful patterns in these representations, yet designing models that preserve key features remains a significant challenge. One such critical feature is reciprocity, which reflects the balance of bidirectional interactions in directed networks and provides insights into the underlying structural and dynamical principles that shape their connectivity. This paper introduces a statistical mechanics framework for directed networks, modeling them as ensembles of interacting fermions. By controlling reciprocity and other network properties, our formalism offers a principled approach to analyzing directed network structures and dynamics, introducing a new perspectives, and models and analytical tools for empirical studies.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory of fading ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Nickel-Doped Barium Titanate via Machine Learning-Accelerated Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocatalytic water splitting, which produces hydrogen and oxygen through water electrolysis, is a promising method for generating renewable, carbon-free alternative fuels. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by the high costs of Pt cathodes and IrO$_{x}$/RuO$_{x}$ anode catalysts. In the search for cost-effective alternatives, barium titanate (BaTiO$_{3}$) has emerged as a compelling candidate. This inexpensive, non-toxic perovskite oxide can be synthesized from earth-abundant precursors and has shown potential for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in recent studies. In this work, we explore the OER activity of pristine and Ni-doped BaTiO$_{3}$ at explicit water interfaces using metadynamics (MetaD) simulations. To enable efficient and practical MetaD for OER, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential based on artificial neural networks (ANN), achieving large-scale and long-time simulations with near-DFT accuracy. Our simulations reveal that Ni-doping enhances the catalytic activity of BaTiO$_{3}$ for OER, consistent with experimental observations, while providing mechanistic insights into this enhancement.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Extinction in Large Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the exploration-exploitation trade-off for large multiplayer coordination games where players strategise via Q-Learning, a common learning framework in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Q-Learning is known to have two shortcomings, namely non-convergence and potential equilibrium selection problems, when there are multiple fixed points, called Quantal Response Equilibria (QRE). Furthermore, whilst QRE have full support for finite games, it is not clear how Q-Learning behaves as the game becomes large. In this paper, we characterise the critical exploration rate that guarantees convergence to a unique fixed point, addressing the two shortcomings above. Using a generating-functional method, we show that this rate increases with the number of players and the alignment of their payoffs. For many-player coordination games with perfectly aligned payoffs, this exploration rate is roughly twice that of $p$-player zero-sum games. As for large games, we provide a structural result for QRE, which suggests that as the game size increases, Q-Learning converges to a QRE near the boundary of the simplex of the action space, a phenomenon we term asymptotic extinction, where a constant fraction of the actions are played with zero probability at a rate $o(1/N)$ for an $N$-action game.</description>

      <title>Synaptic plasticity alters the nature of chaos transition in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In realistic neural circuits, both neurons and synapses are coupled in dynamics with separate time scales. The circuit functions are intimately related to these coupled dynamics. However, it remains challenging to understand the intrinsic properties of the coupled dynamics. Here, we develop the neuron-synapse coupled quasi-potential method to demonstrate how learning induces the qualitative change in macroscopic behaviors of recurrent neural networks. We find that under the Hebbian learning, a large Hebbian strength will alter the nature of the chaos transition, from a continuous type to a discontinuous type, where the onset of chaos requires a smaller synaptic gain compared to the non-plastic counterpart network. In addition, our theory predicts that under feedback and homeostatic learning, the location and type of chaos transition are retained, and only the chaotic fluctuation is adjusted. Our theoretical calculations are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Does the brain behave like a (complex) network? I. Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15711v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph theory is now becoming a standard tool in system-level neuroscience. However, endowing observed brain anatomy and dynamics with a complex network structure does not entail that the brain actually works as a network. Asking whether the brain behaves as a network means asking whether network properties count. From the viewpoint of neurophysiology and, possibly, of brain physics, the most substantial issues a network structure may be instrumental in addressing relate to the influence of network properties on brain dynamics and to whether these properties ultimately explain some aspects of brain function. Here, we address the dynamical implications of complex network, examining which aspects and scales of brain activity may be understood to genuinely behave as a network. To do so, we first define the meaning of networkness, and analyse some of its implications. We then examine ways in which brain anatomy and dynamics can be endowed with a network structure and discuss possible ways in which network structure may be shown to represent a genuine organisational principle of brain activity, rather than just a convenient description of its anatomy and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic heterogeneity in the self-induced spin glass state of elemental neodymium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are magnetic materials exhibiting numerous magnetization patterns, that randomly vary both in real space and in time. To date, it is still not well understood what the nature of these spatiotemporal dynamics is, namely if they are completely random or if there are links between given time and length scales. Here we show the ubiquitous behavior of dynamic heterogeneity in the self-induced spin glass state of elemental neodymium. We used spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with atomistic spin dynamics simulations to image the locally ordered magnetic patterns in the glass state, and tracked the induced spatiotemporal dynamics in response to external perturbations. We observed that the real space magnetization exhibited a coexistence of slow and fast dynamics reminiscent of dynamic heterogeneity in structural glasses. Furthermore, we found that zero-field cooling imprints a specific set of metastable periodicities into the spin glass, which evolved during aging and could be thermally reinitialized. These results demonstrate the importance of local length scales for the understanding of aging dynamics in spin glasses and provide a link to the more general picture of true glasses.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and eigenstate correlations in strongly disordered quantum many-body systems</title>

Abstract: The many-body localised phase of quantum systems is an unusual dynamical phase wherein the system fails to thermalise and yet, entanglement grows unboundedly albeit very slowly in time. We present a microscopic theory of this ultraslow growth of entanglement in terms of dynamical eigenstate correlations of strongly disordered, interacting quantum systems in the many-body localised regime. These correlations involve sets of four or more eigenstates and hence, go beyond correlations involving pairs of eigenstates which are usually studied in the context of eigenstate thermalisation or lack thereof. We consider the minimal case, namely the second R\'enyi entropy of entanglement, of an initial product state as well as that of the time-evolution operator, wherein the correlations involve quartets of four eigenstates. We identify that the dynamics of the entanglement entropy is dominated by the spectral correlations within certain special quartets of eigenstates. We uncover the spatial structure of these special quartets and the ensuing statistics of the spectral correlations amongst the eigenstates therein, which reveals a hierarchy of timescales or equivalently, energyscales. We show that the hierarchy of these timescales along with their non-trivial distributions conspire to produce the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement, characteristic of the many-body localised regime. The underlying spatial structures in the set of special quartets also provides a microscopic understanding of the spacetime picture of the entanglement growth. The theory therefore provides a much richer perspective on entanglement growth in strongly disordered systems compared to the commonly employed phenomenological approach based on the $\ell$-bit picture.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box: predicting the trainability of deep neural networks with reconstruction entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important challenge in machine learning is to predict the initial conditions under which a given neural network will be trainable. We present a method for predicting the trainable regime in parameter space for deep feedforward neural networks (DNNs) based on reconstructing the input from subsequent activation layers via a cascade of single-layer auxiliary networks. We show that a single epoch of training of the shallow cascade networks is sufficient to predict the trainability of the deep feedforward network on a range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and white noise), thereby providing a significant reduction in overall training time. We achieve this by computing the relative entropy between reconstructed images and the original inputs, and show that this probe of information loss is sensitive to the phase behaviour of the network. We further demonstrate that this method generalizes to residual neural networks (ResNets) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Moreover, our method illustrates the network's decision making process by displaying the changes performed on the input data at each layer, which we demonstrate for both a DNN trained on MNIST and the vgg16 CNN trained on the ImageNet dataset. Our results provide a technique for significantly accelerating the training of large neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</description>
