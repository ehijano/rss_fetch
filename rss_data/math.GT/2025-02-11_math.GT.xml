      <title>Bounded ideal triangulations of infinite Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of a bounded ideal triangulation of an infinite Riemann surface and parametrize Teichm\"uller spaces of infinite surfaces which allow bounded triangulations. We prove that our parametrization is real-analytic. Riemann surfaces with bounded geometry and countably many punctures belong to the class of surfaces with bounded ideal triangulations. In comparison, the Fenchel-Nielsen parametrization for surfaces with bounded geometry is not known, while the Fenchel-Nielsen parametrization for surfaces with bounded pants decompositions is known as a homeomorphism but it is not known whether it is real-analytic</description>

      <title>The combinatorial transverse intersection algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs (with challenging obstacles) on the three torus with its cubical decomposition:
  Firstly, a combinatorial graded intersection algebra (graded by the codimension) which is commutative and associative defined by transversality on the usual chains which are in general position. This, (with extra elements added) on the entire $h$-cubulated three torus whose differential satisfies the product rule and which agrees with the set theoretic intersection product appropriately weighted. The construction is characterized given these properties (see Comprehensive Theorem below). The challenge is to minimally adjoin infinitesimal elements when the geometric elements have glancing but transversal intersections weighted in such a way that the associativity (and commutativity) is not destroyed and the Leibniz product rule for the boundary operator is restored.
  Secondly, there is a $2h$ subcomplex introduced in Sullivan arXiv:1811.00086 and discussed further in Lawrence-Sullivan-Ranade arXiv:2011.07505 which shares the above good properties when ideal elements are added AND which also has a star bijection between degree zero and degree three and between one and degree two. This is introduced for the purposes of computations of 3D fluid motion, incompressible, with or without viscosity. For the latter purposes one only needs the good properties in dimensions zero, one and two, where the situation is a bit better.
  It is a new feature that the three good properties are respected by the crumbling chain mappings from coarse to finer subdivisions. The star operator does not cooperate with crumbling and is the sole reason in this discrete approximation for the Kolmogorov cascade to finer scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem for the complete graph on six vertices was extended to the general complete graph on $n$ vertices by Kazakov--Korablev as a congruence modulo $2$, and its integral lift was given by Morishita--Nikkuni. However, the proof is complicated and long. In this paper, we provide a shorter proof of the generalized Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem over integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an estimate of the amenable category of oriented closed connected complete affine manifolds whose fundamental group contains an infinite amenable normal subgroup. As an application we show that all such manifolds have zero simplicial volume. This answers a question by L\"uck in the case of complete affine manifolds.
  Our construction also provides the vanishing of stable integral simplicial volume and minimal volume entropy. This means that such manifolds satisfy integral approximation.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Integral Homology Spheres and Binary Icosahedral Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the representations of hyperbolic integral homology spheres into the binary icosahedral group $2I$. We specifically give a geometric meaning to $2I$ representations by relating them to Larsen's notion of quotient dimension, which gives us a sense of the frequency of regular finite covers. Our main theorem shows that hyperbolic 3-manifolds can only have quotient dimension 2 or 3, and each case is obtained infinitely many times. More specifically, we show that those with no non-trivial $A_5$ representations have quotient dimension 3, and we find a family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on an infinite 2-bridge hyperbolic knot family with quotient dimension 2.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Ricci Flow and Thurston's Triangulation Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thurston's triangulation conjecture asserts that every hyperbolic 3-manifold admits a geometric decomposition into ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra, a result proven only for certain special 3-manifolds. This paper presents combinatorial Ricci flow as a systematic and general approach to addressing Thurston's triangulation conjecture, showing that the flow converges if and only if the triangulation is geometric. First, we prove the rigidity of the most general hyperbolic polyhedral 3-manifolds constructed by isometrically gluing partially truncated and decorated hyperbolic tetrahedra, demonstrating that the metrics are uniquely determined by cone angles modulo isometry and decoration changes. Then, we demonstrate that combinatorial Ricci flow evolves polyhedral metrics toward complete hyperbolic structures with geometric decompositions when convergent. Conversely, the existence of a geometric triangulation guarantees flow convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish new instances of the cutoff phenomenon for geodesic paths and for the Brownian motion on compact hyperbolic manifolds. We prove that for any fixed compact hyperbolic manifold, the geodesic path started on a spatially localized initial condition exhibits cutoff. Our work also extends results obtained by Golubev and Kamber on hyperbolic surfaces of large volume to any dimension. Our proof builds upon a spectral strategy introduced by Lubetzky and Peres for Ramanujan graphs and on a detailed spectral analysis of the spherical mean operator.</description>

      <title>The smooth classification of 4-dimensional complete intersections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.09216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the "Sullivan Conjecture" on the classification of 4-dimensional complete intersections up to diffeomorphism. Here an $n$-dimensional complete intersection is a smooth complex variety formed by the transverse intersection of $k$ hypersurfaces in $CP^{n+k}$.
  Previously Kreck and Traving proved the 4-dimensional Sullivan Conjecture when 64 divides the total degree (the product of the degrees of the defining hypersurfaces) and Fang and Klaus proved that the conjecture holds up to the action of the group of homotopy 8-spheres $\Theta_8 = Z/2$.
  Our proof involves several new ideas, including the use of the Hambleton-Madsen theory of degree-$d$ normal maps, which provide a fresh perspective on the Sullivan Conjecture in all dimensions. This leads to an unexpected connection between the Segal Conjecture for $S^1$ and the Sullivan Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conjecturally, a knot in the 3-sphere has only finitely many non-integer non-characterizing slopes. We verify this conjecture for all knots with knot Floer homology satisfying certain simplicity conditions. The class of knots satisfying our notion of simplicity includes alternating knots, $L$-space knots and the vast majority of knots with at most 12 crossings. For arbitrary knots in the 3-sphere we show that almost all slopes $p/q$ with $|q|\geq 3$ are characterizing. In addition, we show that all $L$-space knots and almost $L$-space knots have infinitely many integer characterizing slopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies knots in three dimensional projective space. Our technique is to associate a virtual link to a link in projective space so that equivalent projective links go to equivalent virtual links (modulo a special flype move). We apply techniques in virtual knot theory to obtain a Jones polynomial for projective links. We show that this is equivalent to the known Jones polynomial defined by Drobotukhina for them. We apply virtual Khovanov homology and the virtual Rasmussen invariant of Dye, Kaestner, and Kauffman to projective links. We compare this cohomology theory with the Khovanov type theory developed by Manolescu and Willis for projective knots. We show that these theories are essentially equivalent.</description>

Abstract: We study the local structure of the representation variety of a knot group into SL(n,C) at certain diagonal representations. In particular we determine the tangent cone of the representation variety at these diagonal representations, and show that the latter can be deformed into irreducible representations. Furthermore, we use Luna's slice theorem to analyze the local structure of the  character variety.</description>

Abstract: We extend the generalized Khovanov bracket to smooth link cobordisms in $\mathbb{R}^3\times I$ and prove that the resulting theory is functorial up to global invertible scalars. The generalized Khovanov bracket can be specialized to both even and odd Khovanov homology. Particularly by setting $\pi=-1$, we obtain that odd Khovanov homology is functorial up to sign. We end by showing that odd Khovanov homology is not functorial under smooth link cobordisms in $S^3\times I$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We produce the first examples relating non-orientable exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian links to cluster theory, showing that the ungraded augmentation variety of certain max-tb representatives of Legendrian $2$-bridge links is isomorphic to a product of $A_n$-type cluster varieties. As part of this construction, we describe a surjective map from the set of (possibly non-orientable) exact Lagrangian fillings to cluster seeds, producing a product of Catalan numbers of distinct fillings. We also relate the ruling stratification of the ungraded augmentation variety to Lam and Speyer's anticlique stratification of acyclic cluster varieties, showing that the two coincide in this context. As a corollary, we apply a result of Rutherford to show that the cluster-theoretic stratification encodes the information of the lowest $a$-degree term of the Kauffman polynomial of the smooth isotopy class of the $2$-bridge links we study.</description>

Abstract: This book provides a self-contained introduction to geometric group theory. The topics range from an introduction of Cayley and Schreier graphs to Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth and amenability. We discuss the ping-pong lemma, quasi-isometries, growth of groups, hyperbolicity, and other related notions. The book is based on graduate courses and can be used for such a course or for independent study.</description>

      <title>Manturov Projection for Virtual Legendrian Knots in $ST^*F$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kauffman virtual knots are knots in thickened surfaces $F\times R$ considered up to isotopy, stabilizations and destabilizations, and diffeomorphisms of $F\times R$ induced by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of $F$. Similarly, virtual Legendrian knots, introduced by Cahn and Levi~\cite{CahnLevi}, are Legendrian knots in $ST^*F$ with the natural contact structure. Virtual Legendrian knots are considered up to isotopy, stabilization and destabilization of the surface away from the front projection of the Legendrian knot, as well as up to contact isomorphisms of $ST^*F$ induced by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of $F$.
  We show that there is a projection operation $proj$ from the set of virtual isotopy classes of Legendrian knots to the set of isotopy classes of Legendrian knots in $ST^*S^2$. This projection is obtained by substituting some of the classical crossings of the front diagram for a virtual crossing. It restricts to the identity map on the set of virtual isotopy classes of classical Legendrian knots. In particular, the projection $proj$ extends invariants of Legendrian knots to invariants of virtual Legendrian knots. Using the projection $proj$, we show that the virtual crossing number of every classical Legendrian knot equals its crossing number. We also prove that the virtual canonical genus of a Legendrian knot is equal to the canonical genus.
  The construction of $proj$ is inspired by the work of Manturov.</description>
