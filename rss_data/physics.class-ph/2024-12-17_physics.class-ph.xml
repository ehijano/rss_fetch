      <title>Modeling of Electromagnetic Radiation using a Dual Four-Potential Representation: From Dipole Blade Radiators to Ribbon Loop-like Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore classical electromagnetic radiation using a dual four-dimensional potential $\Theta^\mu$ approach. Our focus is on the Planar Dipole Blade Antenna (PDBA), a system consisting of two flat conductive regions on the $xy$-plane, separated by a gap $\mathcal{G}$, with alternating potentials applied to the conductors. This method emphasizes the use of the scalar magnetic potential $\Psi(\boldsymbol{r},t)$ and the electric vector potential $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$, which generates the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}(\boldsymbol{r},t)=\nabla\times\boldsymbol{\Theta}(\boldsymbol{r},t)$ in free space. These potentials replace the standard magnetic vector potential $\boldsymbol{A}$ and the scalar electric potential $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ in our analysis. For harmonic radiation, the electromagnetic field can be expressed in terms of the electric vector potential $\boldsymbol{\Theta}(\boldsymbol{r},t)$. We derive a corresponding retarded vector potential for $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$ in terms of a two-dimensional vector field $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{W}}(\boldsymbol{r},t)$, which flows through the gap region $\mathcal{G}$. This dual analytical approach yields mathematically equivalent expressions for modeling Planar Blade Antennas, analogous to those used for ribbons in the region $\mathcal{G}$, simplifying the mathematical problem. In the gapless limit, this approach reduces the two-dimensional radiator (PDBA) to a one-dimensional wire-loop-like antenna, significantly simplifying the problem's dimensionality. This leads to a dual version of Jefimenko's equations for the electric field, where $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{W}}$ behaves like a surface current in the gap region and satisfies a continuity condition. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we provide an analytical solution for a PDBA with a thin annular gap at low frequency.</description>

      <title>Line shape of soft photon radiation generated at zero angle in an undulator with a dispersive medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of undulator radiation from a bunch of charged particles, taking into account a medium polarization, is considered. In a dispersive medium, at a zero angle, in addition to hard photons, soft photons are also generated. If the wavelength of the soft photons is greater than or equal to the longitudinal size of the microbunches formed during the FEL process, the microbunches radiate coherently. Consequently, the radiation of the bunch will be partially coherent. As a result, intense, quasi-monochromatic, and directed X-ray photon beams are produced, which can have wide practical applications.</description>

      <title>Contemporary Reaction to Gibbs's Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: J. Willard Gibbs published a book in 1902 on statistical mechanics that quickly received significant attention from his contemporaries because of the reputation that he had secured with his prior work on thermodynamics. People reading Gibbs's book were often familiar with Ludwig Boltzmann's work on the kinetic theory of gases. This article looks at the published response to Gibbs's book in the decade following its publication. What did these readers get from reading Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics? How did they put that to use? Was it fruitful? Samuel H. Burbury had been strongly critical of the assumptions on which Boltzmann's theory was built and had expressed a need for a theory without them. Burbury was pleased with the foundation and rigor of Gibbs's approach, since in his first three chapters he had built on analytical mechanics in the Hamiltonian formulation, a many-body dynamical system. Others found Gibbs hard to understand and some were critical. Hendrik A. Lorentz began teaching Gibbs's dynamical theory and supervised a thesis by Leonard Ornstein in which Orenstein developed applications built on grand canonical ensembles and correlations, which were contrary to Boltzmann's molecular disorder. Ornstein and Zernike expanded on material in that thesis to develop a theory of critical opalescence without infinities.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically, and they can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, -, -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimisation of the action by employing the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density, namely, $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha \phi_{a}\left(x\right))$, as the function of the symmetric fractional derivative of the field, e.g. in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>

      <title>Noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design and implement quantum circuits for the simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. The circuit depth of our approach scales as $O(n^{2})$ for $n$ qubits representing the solution on $2^{n}$ grid points, and leads to infidelities of $O(2^{-4n} t^{2})$ for simulation time $t$ assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetries, closed-form solutions, and conservation laws of a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lie-point symmetry method is used to find some closed-form solutions for a constitutive equation modeling stress in elastic materials. The partial differential equation (PDE), which involves a power law with arbitrary exponent n, was investigated by Mason and his collaborators (Magan et al., Wave Motion, 77, 156-185, 2018). The Lie algebra for the model is five-dimensional for the shearing exponent n &gt; 0, and it includes translations in time, space, and displacement, as well as time-dependent changes in displacement and a scaling symmetry. Applying Lie's symmetry method, we compute the optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras. Using the subalgebras, several reductions and closed-form solutions for the model are obtained both for general exponent n and special case n = 1. Furthermore, it is shown that for general n &gt; 0 the model has interesting conservation laws which are computed with symbolic software using the scaling symmetry of the given PDE.</description>
