      <title>Fast fitting of phylogenetic mixed effects models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed effects models are among the most commonly used statistical methods for the exploration of multispecies data. In recent years, also Joint Species Distribution Models and Generalized Linear Latent Variale Models have gained in popularity when the goal is to incorporate residual covariation between species that cannot be explained due to measured environmental covariates. Few software implementations of such models exist that can additionally incorporate phylogenetic information, and those that exist tend to utilize Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimation, so that model fitting takes a long time. In this article we develop new methods for quickly and flexibly fitting phylogenetic mixed models, potentially incorporating residual covariation between species using latent variables, with the possibility to estimate the strength of phylogenetic structuring in species responses per environmental covariate, and while incorporating correlation between different covariate effects. By combining Variational approximations with a reduced rank matrix normal covariance structure, Nearest Neighbours Gaussian Processes, and parallel computation, phylogenetic mixed models can be fitted much more quickly than the current state-of-the-art. Two simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed combination of approximations is not only fast, but also enjoys high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate use of the method with a real world dataset of wood-decaying fungi.</description>

      <title>Statistically Optimal Uncertainty Quantification for Expensive Black-Box Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification, by means of confidence interval (CI) construction, has been a fundamental problem in statistics and also important in risk-aware decision-making. In this paper, we revisit the basic problem of CI construction, but in the setting of expensive black-box models. This means we are confined to using a low number of model runs, and without the ability to obtain auxiliary model information such as gradients. In this case, there exist classical methods based on data splitting, and newer methods based on suitable resampling. However, while all these resulting CIs have similarly accurate coverage in large sample, their efficiencies in terms of interval length differ, and a systematic understanding of which method and configuration attains the shortest interval appears open. Motivated by this, we create a theoretical framework to study the statistical optimality on CI tightness under computation constraint. Our theory shows that standard batching, but also carefully constructed new formulas using uneven-size or overlapping batches, batched jackknife, and the so-called cheap bootstrap and its weighted generalizations, are statistically optimal. Our developments build on a new bridge of the classical notion of uniformly most accurate unbiasedness with batching and resampling, by viewing model runs as asymptotically Gaussian "data", as well as a suitable notion of homogeneity for CIs.</description>

      <title>Boosting Earth System Model Outputs And Saving PetaBytes in their Storage Using Exascale Climate Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and scalable implementation of an exascale climate emulator for addressing the escalating computational and storage requirements of high-resolution Earth System Model simulations. We utilize the spherical harmonic transform to stochastically model spatio-temporal variations in climate data. This provides tunable spatio-temporal resolution and significantly improves the fidelity and granularity of climate emulation, achieving an ultra-high spatial resolution of 0.034 (approximately 3.5 km) in space. Our emulator, trained on 318 billion hourly temperature data points from a 35-year and 31 billion daily data points from an 83-year global simulation ensemble, generates statistically consistent climate emulations. We extend linear solver software to mixed-precision arithmetic GPUs, applying different precisions within a single solver to adapt to different correlation strengths. The PaRSEC runtime system supports efficient parallel matrix operations by optimizing the dynamic balance between computation, communication, and memory requirements. Our BLAS3-rich code is optimized for systems equipped with four different families and generations of GPUs, scaling well to achieve 0.976 EFlop/s on 9,025 nodes (36,100 AMD MI250X multichip module (MCM) GPUs) of Frontier (nearly full system), 0.739 EFlop/s on 1,936 nodes (7,744 Grace-Hopper Superchips (GH200)) of Alps, 0.243 EFlop/s on 1,024 nodes (4,096 A100 GPUs) of Leonardo, and 0.375 EFlop/s on 3,072 nodes (18,432 V100 GPUs) of Summit.</description>

      <title>FDApy: a Python package for functional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.11003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FDApy, an open-source Python package for the analysis of functional data. The package provides tools for the representation of (multivariate) functional data defined on different dimensional domains and for functional data that is irregularly sampled. Additionally, dimension reduction techniques are implemented for multivariate and/or multidimensional functional data that are regularly or irregularly sampled. A toolbox for generating functional datasets is also provided. The documentation includes installation and usage instructions, examples on simulated and real datasets and a complete description of the API. FDApy is released under the MIT license. The code and documentation are available at https://github.com/StevenGolovkine/FDApy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scalability in Bayesian Nonparametric Factor Analysis of Spatiotemporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05802v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript puts forward novel practicable spatiotemporal Bayesian factor analysis frameworks computationally feasible for moderate to large data. Our models exhibit significantly enhanced computational scalability and storage efficiency, deliver high overall modeling performances, and possess powerful inferential capabilities for adequately predicting outcomes at future time points or new spatial locations and satisfactorily clustering spatial locations into regions with similar temporal trajectories, a frequently encountered crucial task. We integrate on top of a baseline separable factor model with temporally dependent latent factors and spatially dependent factor loadings under a probit stick breaking process (PSBP) prior a new slice sampling algorithm that permits unknown varying numbers of spatial mixture components across all factors and guarantees them to be non-increasing through the MCMC iterations, thus considerably enhancing model flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. We further introduce a novel spatial latent nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) prior and new sequential updating algorithms for the spatially varying latent variables in the PSBP prior, thereby attaining high spatial scalability. The markedly accelerated posterior sampling and spatial prediction as well as the great modeling and inferential performances of our models are substantiated by our simulation experiments.</description>
