      <title>Tumor microenvironment (Part I): Tissue integrity in a rat model of peripheral neural cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and MPZ (myelin protein zero) are thought to be a factor in the integrity of nerve tissues. In this report, we attempted to trace the expression of ICAM-1, responsible for cell-to-cell adhesion, and of MPZ, the main constituent of myelin sheath, in malignant tissues of the sciatic nerve (SN) in inbred male Copenhagen rats. AT-1 Cells (anaplastic tumor 1) were injected in the perineurial sheath, and tissues of the SNs were collected after 7, 14 and 21 days and compared to a sham-operated group of rats (n = 6 each). Tissues were sectioned and histologically examined, under light microscope, and stained for measuring the immunoreactivity of ICAM-1 and MPZ under laser scanning microscope. The cancer model was established, and the tumor growth was confirmed. ICAM-1 showed severe decreases, proportional to the growing anaplastic cells, as compared to the sham group. MPZ revealed, however, a distinct defensive pattern before substantially decreasing in a comparison with sham. These results support the notion that malignancies damage peripheral nerves and cause severe axonal injury and loss of neuronal integrity, and clearly define the role of ICAM-1 and MPZ in safeguarding the nerve tissues.</description>

      <title>Physical Principles of Quantum Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical monograph provides a comprehensive overview of the field of quantum biology. It approaches quantum biology from a physical perspective with core quantum mechanical concepts presented foremost to provide a theoretical foundation for the field. An extensive body of research is covered to clarify the significance of quantum biology as a scientific field, outlining the field's long-standing importance in the historical development of quantum theory. This lays the essential groundwork to enable further advances in nanomedicine and biotechnology. Written for academics, biological science researchers, physicists, biochemists, medical technologists, and students of quantum mechanics, this text brings clarity to fundamental advances being made in the emerging science of quantum biology.</description>

      <title>Phase changes of the flow rate in the vertebral artery caused by debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair: effects of flow path and local vessel stiffness on vertebral arterial pulsation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite numerous studies on cerebral arterial blood flow, there has not yet been a comprehensive description of hemodynamics in patients undergoing debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair (dTEVAR), a promising surgical option for aortic arch aneurysms. A phase delay of the flow rate in the left vertebral artery (LVA) in patients after dTEVAR compared to those before was experimentally observed, while the phase in the right vertebral artery (RVA) remained almost the same before and after surgery. Since this surgical intervention included stent graft implantation and extra-anatomical bypass, it was expected that the intracranial hemodynamic changes due to dTEVAR were coupled with fluid flow and pulse waves in cerebral arteries. To clarify this issue, A one-dimensional model (1D) was used to numerically investigate the relative contribution (i.e., local vessel stiffness and flow path changes) of the VA flow rate to the phase difference. The numerical results demonstrated a phase delay of flow rate in the LVA but not the RVA in postoperative patients undergoing dTEVAR relative to preoperative patients. The results further showed that the primary factor affecting the phase delay of the flow rate in the LVA after surgery compared to that before was the bypass, i.e., alteration of flow path, rather than stent grafting, i.e., the change in local vessel stiffness. The numerical results provide insights into hemodynamics in postoperative patients undergoing dTEVAR, as well as knowledge about therapeutic decisions.</description>
