      <title>Direct Measurement of the $^{59}$Cu$(p,\alpha)^{56}$Ni Excitation Function to Constrain the Ni--Cu Cycle Strength and Its Impact on Explosive Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new direct measurement of the $^{59}$Cu$(p,\alpha){}^{56}$Ni excitation function from 2.43 to 5.88~MeV in the center-of-mass frame was performed in inverse kinematics using the high-efficiency MUSIC active-target detector at FRIB. This reaction plays a critical role in constraining the strength of the Ni--Cu cycle in explosive astrophysical environments such as Type~I X-ray bursts and the $\nu$p-process in neutrino-driven winds following core-collapse supernovae. The newly derived stellar reaction rate is systematically lower than the REACLIB evaluation, resulting in less than 0.1\% recycling through the Ni--Cu cycle in X-ray bursts and an enhanced efficiency of the $\nu$p-process up to temperatures of $T_9 \approx 3.7$.</description>

      <title>Detailed Study of the $^{59}$Cu(p,$\alpha)^{56}$Ni Reaction and Constraints on Its Astrophysical Reaction Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{59}$Cu$(p,\alpha)^{56}$Ni reaction plays an important role in explosive astrophysical scenarios such as Type I X-ray bursts and the $\nu p$-process in neutrino-driven winds following a core-collapse supernova. In both cases, this reaction has been proposed to significantly affect the synthesis of heavier nuclei by regulating the flow of nucleosynthesis through the Ni--Cu cycle. In this work, we present a direct measurement of the $^{59}\mathrm{Cu}(p,\alpha)^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ excitation function from 2.43--5.88 MeV in the center-of-mass frame. The experiment was performed in inverse kinematics using the high-efficiency MUSIC active-target detector at FRIB. This measurement allowed tight constraints to be placed on the astrophysical reaction rate. The derived stellar rate is systematically lower than the REACLIB rate and remains below the competing $(p,\gamma)$ rate for $T_9 \lesssim 3$.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal angular entanglement between decaying particles in ultra-peripheral ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) involving relativistic heavy ions are a unique laboratory to study quantum correlations. The intense electromagnetic fields generate high rates of photonuclear interactions, including events involving multiple photon exchange. Multiple photon exchange can result in the production of multiple vector mesons and/or nuclear excitations. These interactions share a common impact parameter, so the photons have the same linear polarization. The shared polarization entangles the particles, leading to unique quantum correlations. The decays of these vector excitations are sensitive to this polarization, allowing for the study of these correlations.
  This letter will compare classical and quantum calculations of the correlations between these azimuthal directions. The two approaches predict vert different angular correlations. The differences are akin to those seen with polarized photons in tests of Bells inequality. Uniquely, UPC photoproduction can produce final states containing three or more particles, all entangled with the same polarization. These more complex states exhibit additional unique phenomenology, allowing new tests of multi-particle entanglement.</description>

      <title>Low energy elastic scattering of H, D and T on $^{3}$He and $^{4}$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the needs of atomic tritium sources for neutrino mass experiments, we present calculations of energy-dependent elastic scattering cross sections of hydrogen isotopes (H, D and T) on helium isotopes ($^3$He and $^4$He) in the temperature range 1~mK to 300~K. The tritium-on-helium cross sections are found to be enhanced over their hydrogen-on-helium counterparts by a near-threshold resonant s-wave bound state at low energy, similar to that predicted in the triplet T-T system. While the energy-dependent cross sections span a wide range at low energy due to this s-wave enhancement, they tend toward a common value at high energy where the scattering becomes effectively geometric in nature.</description>

      <title>$f_2(1270)\to\pi+\pi$ as a probe of spin and vorticity in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation between vorticity and spin alignment in heavy-ion collisions can be probed through polarization measurements of hadrons, whose total spin originates from both constituent-quark spins and orbital angular momentum in the quark-model framework. To motivate such experimental studies, we calculate the general angular distribution of produced pion in $f_2(1270)\to\pi+\pi$ using interaction Lagrangian and helicity formalism and check that both methods yield the same result. The distribution is given as a function of angle between pion and initial quantization axis of $f_2$ and the spin density matrix element of $f_2$. Its diagonal entries and $\rho_{20}$ component were computed assuming local thermal equilibrium and blast wave model for different centrality classes, hence given as a function of azimuthal angle with respect to the impact parameter.</description>

      <title>Simulation and optimization of the Active Magnetic Shield of the n2EDM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The n2EDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute aims to conduct a high-sensitivity search for the electric dipole moment of the neutron. Magnetic stability and control are achieved through a combination of passive shielding, provided by a magnetically shielded room (MSR), and a surrounding active field compensation system by an Active Magnetic Shield (AMS). The AMS is a feedback-controlled system of eight coils spanned on an irregular grid, designed to provide magnetic stability to the enclosed volume by actively suppressing external magnetic disturbances. It can compensate static and variable magnetic fields up to $\pm 50$ $\mu$T (homogeneous components) and $\pm 5$ $\mu$T/m (first-order gradients), suppressing them to a few $\mu$T in the sub-Hertz frequency range. We present a full finite element simulation of magnetic fields generated by the AMS in the presence of the MSR. This simulation is of sufficient accuracy to approach our measurements. We demonstrate how the simulation can be used with an example, obtaining an optimal number and placement of feedback sensors using genetic algorithms.</description>

      <title>High-bandwidth frequency domain multiplexed readout of transition-edge sensors for neutrinoless double beta decay searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next-generation of cryogenic neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments require increasingly fast readout in order to improve background discrimination. These experiments, operated as cryogenic calorimeters at $\sim$10 mK, are usually read out by high-impedance neutron transmutation doped (NTD) thermistors, which provide good energy resolution, but are limited by $\sim$1 ms response times. Superconducting detectors, such as transition-edge sensors (TESs) with a time resolution of $\sim$100 $\mu$s, offer superior timing performance over NTD semiconductor bolometers. To make this technology viable for an application to a thousand or more channels, multiplexed readout is necessary in order to minimize the thermal load and radioactive contamination induced by the readout. Frequency-domain multiplexing readout (fMux) for TESs, previously developed at Berkeley Lab and McGill University, is currently in use for mm-wave telescopes with detector sampling rates in the order of 100 Hz. We demonstrate a new readout system, based on the McGill/Berkeley digital fMux readout, to satisfy the higher bandwidth and noise requirements of the next generation of TES-instrumented cryogenic calorimeters. The new readout samples detectors at 156 kHz, three orders of magnitude faster than its cosmology-oriented predecessor. Each multiplexing readout module comprises ten superconducting resonators in the MHz range and a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), interfaced to high-bandwidth field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based electronics for digital signal processing and low-latency feedback.</description>

      <title>A Method to Constrain Preferential Emission and Spectator Dynamics in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal particle production in heavy-ion collisions is influenced both by preferential emission from participating nucleons and by the breakup of spectator matter, yet quantifying these effects experimentally remains challenging. We introduce a Pearson correlation between spectator and charged-particle forward-backward asymmetries as an experimental probe of these phenomena. Using Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV simulated with A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model, we validate that this correlator provides a robust, pseudorapidity-differential measure of the influence of preferential emission on the longitudinal structure of particle production. We further demonstrate that the correlation strength is sensitive to fluctuations in spectator number, which in experiments arise from evaporation and fragmentation of the spectator remnants. The proposed observable therefore offers a data-driven handle for constraining models of preferential emission and spectator breakup, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the final-state longitudinal distributions in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Towards First Detection of the Solar MSW Transition With JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-induced neutrino flavor mixing (the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, or MSW, effect) is a central prediction of the neutrino mixing framework, but it has not been conclusively observed. Direct observation of the energy-dependent MSW transition in the solar electron-neutrino survival probability would solve this, but backgrounds have been prohibitive. We show that our new technique for suppressing muon-induced spallation backgrounds will allow JUNO to measure the MSW transition at $&gt;$4$\sigma$ significance in 10 years. This would strongly support upcoming multi-\$1B next-generation long-baseline experiments and their goals in cementing the neutrino mixing framework.</description>
