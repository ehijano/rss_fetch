      <title>Analytical formulas of coherent-synchrotron-radiation induced microbunching gain and emittance growth in an arbitrary achromatic four-bend chicane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiations (CSR) emitted by a high-brightness electron beam during transport in a bending magnet is a double-edged sword in electron accelerators. While CSR contributes to a stronger radiation field than the incoherent radiation, it simultaneously leads to degradation of the electron beam quality. Specifically, CSR effects manifest in increases of the beam energy spread and the projected emittance, and amplification of the microbunching instability. This paper presents analytical formulas for the CSR-induced microbunching instability gain and for the induced emittance growth in an arbitrary achromatic four-bend chicane with inclusion of both the steady-state and transient CSR effects. The analytical formulas are compared and show good agreement with Vlasov calculations and particle tracking simulations. The obtained analytical formulas are then applied to evaluate the CSR effects in the design of a general achromatic four-bend bunch compressor chicane, providing a quick estimate on the microbunching gain and the induced emittance growth. From the widely adopted symmetric C-shape chicane to a non-symmetric S-shape chicane, our analytical formulas offer insight into the evolution of the microbunching gain and the emittance growth with the variations of design parameters. In comparison to particle tracking simulations currently employed for CSR effect analyses, the analytical formulas presented in this paper significantly reduce the evaluation time, enabling systematic study of parametric dependencies with inclusion of CSR effects within specified design parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>All-optical blast wave control of laser wakefield acceleration in near critical plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for changing the length of laser wakefield electron acceleration in a gas jet by a cylindrical blast wave created by a perpendicularly focused nanosecond laser pulse. The shock front destroys the wake thus stopping interaction between the laser pulse and accelerated electron bunch allowing one to directly control the interaction length and avoid dephasing. It also improves the electron beam quality through the plasma lensing effect between the two shock fronts. We demonstrated both experimentally and numerically how this approach can be used to form quasi-monoenergetic electron bunch with controlled energy and improved divergence as well as to track changes in the bunch parameters during acceleration.</description>
