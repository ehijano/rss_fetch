      <title>Isospectrality in Effective Field Theory Extensions of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two universal predictions of general relativity are the propagation of gravitational waves of large momentum along null geodesics and the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in many families of black holes. In extensions of general relativity, these properties are typically lost: quasinormal modes are no longer isospectral and gravitational wave propagation is no longer geodesic and it exhibits birefringence -- polarization-dependent speed. We study these effects in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with up to eight-derivative terms and show that there is a unique Lagrangian that has a non-birefringent dispersion relation for gravitational waves and isospectral quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit. We argue that both properties are related through a generalized correspondence between eikonal quasinormal modes and unstable photon-sphere orbits. These properties define a special class of theories that we denote as isospectral effective field theories. We note that the lowest-order isospectral correction to general relativity coincides with the quartic-curvature correction arising from type II string theory, suggesting that isospectrality might be a key feature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Starobinsky Inflation and the Species Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potentials in cosmological inflation often involve scalars with trans-Planckian ranges. As a result, towers of states become massless and their presence pushes the fundamental scale not to coincide with $M_{\rm P}$ but rather with the $species\, scale$, $\Lambda$. This scale transforms as an automorphic form of the theory's duality symmetries. We propose that the inflaton potential should be 1) an automorphic invariant form, non-singular over all moduli space, 2) depending only on $\Lambda$ and its field derivatives, and 3) approaching constant values in the large moduli to ensure a long period of inflation. These conditions lead to the proposal $V \sim \lambda(\phi, \phi^*)$, with $\lambda = G^{i\bar{j}} (\partial_i \Lambda)(\partial_{\bar{j}} \Lambda) / \Lambda^2$, determining the 'species scale convex hull'. For a single elliptic complex modulus with $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry, this results in an inflaton potential $V \simeq (\text{Im} \tau)^2 |\tilde{G}_2|^2 / N^2$, with $N \simeq -\log(\text{Im} \tau |\eta(\tau)|^4)$, where $\eta$ is the Dedekind function and $\tilde{G}_2$ the Eisenstein modular form of weight 2. Surprisingly, this potential at large modulus resembles that of the Starobinsky model. We compute inflation parameters yielding results similar to Starobinsky's, but extended to modular invariant expressions. Interestingly, the number of e-folds is proportional to the number of species in the tower, $N_e \simeq N$, and $\epsilon \simeq \Lambda^4$ at large moduli, suggesting that the tower of states plays an important role in the inflation process.</description>

      <title>Time-convolutionless cosmological master equations: Late-time resummations and decoherence for non-local kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a simple toy model of two scalar fields in de Sitter space, playing the roles of "system" and "environment" degrees of freedom, which interact with each other. We show that there are secular divergences in physically relevant observables which arise solely from the non-Markovian part of the memory kernel, contrary to popular belief that secular growth typically comes from local terms in evolution equations. Nevertheless, we show that these terms can still be non-perturbatively resummed, using the time-convolutionless master equation formalism, which improves upon previous approximations. At the same time, there are other physical quantities in the same model that are dominated by local terms in the memory kernel. Therefore, we conclude that, for cosmological backgrounds, either the dissipation or the noise kernel can end up being dominated by non-local terms depending on the nature of the system-environment coupling.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of fermions at local equilibrium: Second-order gradient expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the spin polarization of spin-1/2 fermions in a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the second order in the gradient expansion, including second-order derivatives. The second-order derivative terms vanish if the local equilibrium hypersurface is the hyperplane $t=const$ in the collision center-of-mass frame. However, since the freeze-out hypersurface has a non-trivial space-time structure, these terms may result in a non-vanishing contribution to the spin polarization, whose magnitude needs to be assessed with numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Bootstrap of Massive Inflation Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflation correlators with massive exchanges are central observables of cosmological collider physics, and are also important theoretical data for us to better understand quantum field theories in dS. However, they are difficult to compute directly due to many technical complications of the Schwinger-Keldysh integral. In this work, we initiate a new bootstrap program for massive inflation correlators with dispersion relations on complex momentum planes. We classify kinematic variables of a correlator into vertex energies and line energies, and develop two distinct types of dispersion relations for both of them, respectively called vertex dispersion and line dispersion relations. These dispersion methods allow us to obtain full analytical results of massive correlators from a knowledge of their oscillatory signals alone, while the oscillatory signal at the tree level can be related to simpler subgraphs via the cutting rule. We further apply this method to massive loop correlators, and obtain new analytical expressions for loop diagrams much simpler than existing results from spectral decomposition. In particular, we show that the analyticity demands the existence of an "irreducible background" in the loop correlator, which is unambiguously defined, free of UV divergence, and independent of renormalization schemes.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Godel Theorems on Third Quantized Theories Like String Field Theory and Group Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation that spacetime and quantum fields on it have to be dynamically produced in any theory of quantum gravity implies that quantum gravity should be defined on configuration space of fields rather than spacetime. Such a theory that is defined on the configuration space of fields rather than spacetime is a third quantized theory. So, both string theory and group field theory are third-quantized theories. Thus, using axioms of string field theory, we motivate similar axioms for group field theory. Then using the structure of these axioms for string field theory and group field theory, we identify general features of axioms for any such third quantized theory of quantum gravity. Thus, we show that such third-quantized theories of quantum gravity can be formulated as formal axiomatic systems. We then analyze the consequences of Godel theorems on such third quantized theories. We thus address problems of consistency and completeness of any third quantized theories of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Beyond Energy: Teleporting Current, Charge, and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an homage to Quantum Energy Teleportation, we generalize the idea to arbitrary physical observables, not limited to energy, and prove a rigorous upper bound on the activated ("teleported") quantity. The essence of this protocol is a quantum feedback control with respect to the entangled ground state of a quantum many-body system. To demonstrate the concept, we explore a (1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric current and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of long-range correlations across the system after applying control operations only to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge susceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model initially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral dynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally confirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Extremal fixed points and Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling constants of fixed points in the $\epsilon$ expansion at one loop are known to satisfy a quadratic bound due to Rychkov and Stergiou. We refer to fixed points that saturate this bound as extremal fixed points. The theories which contain such fixed points are those which undergo a saddle-node bifurcation, entailing the presence of a marginal operator. Among bifundamental theories, a few examples of infinite families of such theories are known. A necessary condition for extremality is that the sizes of the factors of the symmetry group of a given theory satisfy a specific Diophantine equation, given in terms of what we call the extremality polynomial. In this work we study such Diophantine equations and employ a combination of rigorous and probabilistic estimates to argue that these infinite families constitute rare exceptions. The Pell equation, Falting's theorem, Siegel's theorem, and elliptic curves figure prominently in our analysis. In the cases we study here, more generic classes of multi-fundamental theories saturate the Rychkov-Stergiou bound only in sporadic cases or in limits where they degenerate into simpler known examples.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Lightcones from Quantum SO(2,1) Conformal Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five new families of noncommutative lightcones in 2+1 dimensions are presented as the quantizations of the inequivalent Poisson homogeneous structures that emerge when the lightcone is constructed as a homogeneous space of the SO(2,1) conformal group. Each of these noncommutative lightcones maintains covariance under the action of the respective quantum deformation of the SO(2,1) conformal group. We discuss the role played by SO(2,1) automorphisms in the classification of inequivalent Poisson homogeneous lightcones, as well as the geometric aspects of this construction. The localization properties of the novel quantum lightcones are analyzed and shown to be deeply connected with the geometric features of the Poisson homogeneous spaces.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the set of classical polylogarithmic functions $\text{Li}_n$ with branching locus determined by the solution of $p_1\cdot p_2\cdot \ldots \cdot p_n=0$, where $p_1,\ldots, p_n$ are irreducible polynomials of several variables. We present an algorithm of constructing a complete set of possible arguments of $\text{Li}_n$ functions. The corresponding Mathematica code is included as ancillary file. Using this algorithm and the symbol map, we provide some examples of polylogarithmic identities.</description>

Abstract: One-dimensional quantum mechanical models obeying Smilga's weak supersymmetry are described in the matrix form. They are related to the parasupersymmetric and higher-order derivative deformations of the standard supersymmetric models discussed earlier. Their superconformal indices are computed and shown to be equivalent to the Witten indices for the second order supersymmetric quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Marginality from Leading Soft Gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marginal operators in a $d$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), those with conformal dimension $\Delta=d$, give us information about the space of related theories. This can be incredibly useful when trying to develop an intrinsic definition of a holographic CFT. Recent work has established that in the case of celestial CFTs, those dual to asymptotically flat spacetimes, marginal operators can be constructed as shadow transforms of soft scalars. In this work, rather than starting from a bulk theory of scalars, we start with Yang-Mills and construct marginal operators from soft gluons via light transforms and a new set of transformations called half-shadow transforms. We obtain the local metric and connections for the associated conformal manifold by studying the two- and three-point functions of these marginal operators. We then discuss the implications of this for broadening our understanding of operator product expansions of soft operators in celestial CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of linear gravitational perturbations on cosmological backgrounds of massive fermionic fields. We observe that, when gravitational and matter action are expanded to quadratic order in gravitational perturbations on cosmological backgrounds, the graviton appears to have an off-shell mass. We derive a consistent set of two equations for the evolution of linear classical and quantum gravitational perturbations on general cosmological backgrounds, and demonstrate that the graviton mass disappears at the level of equations of motion (on-shell). In the case we consider the expansion of the Universe is driven by the one-loop backreaction of fermions, and the dynamical gravitons evolve on the same background. These equations govern the evolution of linear gravitational perturbations on general cosmological matter backgrounds. A concrete one-loop calculation is performed for the simple case of massive Dirac fermions when the temperature of the cosmological fluid changes adiabatically when compared with the expansion rate of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Consistency conditions for O-plane unsmearing from second-order perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale-separated AdS compactifications of string theory can be constructed at the two-derivative supergravity level in the presence of smeared orientifold planes. The unsmearing corrections are known to leading order in the large volume, weak coupling limit. However, first-order perturbative approximations of non-linear problems can often produce spurious solutions, which are only weeded out by additional consistency conditions imposed at higher orders. In this work, we revisit the unsmearing procedure and present consistency conditions obtained from the second order warp factor and dilaton equations. This requires proper treatment of the near-source singularities. The resulting conditions appear as integral constraints on various non-linear combinations of the first order corrections, which we argue can generally be satisfied by appropriate choice of integration constants of the leading-order solutions. This provides a non-trivial consistency check for the perturbative unsmearing procedure and supports the existence of scale-separated AdS vacua in string theory.</description>

      <title>The BRST quantisation of chiral BMS-like field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BMS$_3$ Lie algebra belongs to a one-parameter family of Lie algebras obtained by centrally extending abelian extensions of the Witt algebra by a tensor density representation. In this paper we call such Lie algebras $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$, with BMS$_3$ corresponding to the universal central extension of $\lambda = -1$. We construct the BRST complex for $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ in two different ways: one in the language of semi-infinite cohomology and the other using the formalism of vertex operator algebras. We pay particular attention to the case of BMS$_3$ and discuss some natural field-theoretical realisations. We prove two theorems about the BRST cohomology of $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$. The first is the construction of a quasi-isomorphic embedding of the chiral sector of any Virasoro string as a $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ string. The second is the isomorphism (as Batalin--Vilkovisky algebras) of any $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_\lambda$ BRST cohomology and the chiral ring of a topologically twisted $N{=}2$ superconformal field theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-point correlators of conserved charges are argued to be perturbatively IR safe in QCD, which includes not only the density of energy, but also those of electric charge, isospin and baryon number. Theoretical and phenomenological aspects of the density matrix of one-point correlators are discussed in the context of the states produced by a chiral current, as in the decay of a polarized electroweak boson. Densities of some non-conserved charges such as energy with arbitrary non-negative powers, despite their incalculability, are shown to obey an infinite set of consistency constraints. QCD is observed to live near a kink in the allowed parameter space of one-point correlators.</description>

Abstract: We construct and explore the complex structures of boson stars, drawing inspiration from similar configurations of non-topological solitons in Minkowski space. These "molecular states" of boson stars have a multipolar structure and both positive and negative Noether charges within one star, and the opposite charges swap with time. Thanks to the gravitational attraction, they exist even in the case of a free scalar field. We also explore the effects of scalar self-interactions on these complex structures. We propose to use galactic-scale charge-swapping boson stars as a potential solution to the problem of the observed anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Crossing the desert: Towards predictions for SMEFT coefficients from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SMEFT provides a general framework to search for new physics beyond the current reach of direct detection. One such form of new physics is quantum gravity. Based on dimensional analysis, one would expect the prediction that the quantum-gravity contribution to the SMEFT coefficients is unmeasurably tiny at LHC scales. In this paper, we test this expectation in a specific framework for quantum gravity, namely the asymptotic safety framework. In this framework, Wilson coefficients can be calculated in relatively straightforward manner, making a connection between quantum gravity and LHC tests of the SMEFT achievable. We work in a toy model of the Standard Model fermion sector to investigate four-fermion couplings. We find three scenarios in this toy model, based on three distinct fixed points of the Renormalization Group flow. In the first scenario, the expectation from dimensional analysis is borne out and Wilson coefficients are Planck-scale suppressed. In the second and third scenarios, the Wilson coefficients are significantly larger than expected by dimensional analysis, due to interacting fixed points which generate an effective new-physics scale that lies between the LHC scale and the Planck scale. We comment on the implications of these results for the testability of asymptotically safe gravity within the SMEFT framework at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Black holes in effective loop quantum gravity: Covariant holonomy modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent modified gravity provides a covariant, effective framework for obtaining spherically symmetric black hole solutions in models of loop quantum gravity with scale-dependent holonomy modifications. Exact solutions for vacuum black holes in the presence of a cosmological constant are derived here and analyzed in four different gauges, explicitly related to one another by standard coordinate transformations. The global structure is obtained by gluing space-time regions corresponding to the gauge choices, reconstructing a non-singular wormhole space-time for an arbitrary scale-dependent holonomy parameter. This outcome demonstrates the robustness of black-hole models with covariant holonomy modifications under quantization ambiguities. Compared with previous constructions, full covariance of the resulting space-time models as derived here implies subtle new effects and leads to a novel understanding of the parameters in holonomy modifications, distinguishing a constant holonomy length from a possibly scale-dependent function that may change coefficients of holonomy terms. New physical results are obtained for instance in the context of a non-trivial zero-mass limit of holonomy-modified space-times. The existence of a consistent effective space-time structure implies various novel aspects of a net gravitational stress-energy and related thermodynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

      <title>Massive two-loop four-point Feynman integrals at high energies with AsyInt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytic techniques for parametric integrations of massive two-loop four-point Feynman integrals at high energies, and their implementation in the toolbox AsyInt. In the high-energy region, the Feynman integrals involving external and internal massive particles, such as the top quark, Higgs and vector bosons, can be asymptotically expanded and directly calculated in the small-mass limit. With this approach, analytic results for higher orders in the expansion parameter and the dimensional regulator can be obtained with AsyInt. These results are important ingredients for the two-loop electroweak and QCD corrections for $2 \to 2$ scattering processes in the large transverse momenta region, which is relevant to both precision collider phenomenology and new physics searches at the LHC. In this paper, analytic results of representative planar and non-planar Feynman integrals are presented.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theories after GW170817</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the inflationary framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories which produce a primordial gravitational wave speed that respects the constraint imposed by the GW170817 event, namely $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| &lt; 6 \times 10^{-15}$ in natural units. For these theories in general, the scalar Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi (\phi)$ is arbitrary and unrelated to the scalar potential. We develop the inflationary formalism of this theory, and present analytic forms for the slow-roll indices, the observational indices and the $e$-foldings number, assuming solely a slow-roll era and also that the constraints imposed by the GW170817 event hold true. We present in detail an interesting class of models that produces a viable inflationary era. Finally, we investigate the behavior of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet coupling function during the reheating era, in which case the evolution of the Hubble rate satisfies a constant-roll-like relation $\dot{H}=\delta H^2$. As we show, the behavior of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet coupling during the reheating is different from that of the inflationary era. This is due to the fact that the evolution governing the reheating is different compared to the inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Under the most favorable conditions, the upper limit may suggest $\omega_{\rm BD} &gt; 816$. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds arising from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, setting upper limits on scalar backgrounds expected to be two orders of magnitude lower than the total background contributed by both BBH and BNS in one year of observational data. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain Brans-Dicke gravity. However, the future detection of a potential scalar background within the AGWB could provide significant support for gravity theories beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a few recent manuscripts, we used the affine connection to introduce two massless scalar fields in the Einstein-Palatini action. These fields lead to non-metricity. In this article, we will discuss the significance of these fields in inflation and dark energy. We will construct a Lagrangian formalism to include these scalar fields in a theory of gravity coupled with ordinary matter and radiation. We will find that these fields need not to be included in the actions of interacting gauge theories coupled with conserved fermionic vector currents as a part of the connection. The same remains valid for ordinary scalar fields. We can couple the connection-scalars with ordinary matter by adding suitable interaction terms. In this context, we will find that Stokes' theorem leads us to include the right-handed neutrinos in the electroweak theory in curved spacetime even with the Levi-Civita connection. This is required to obtain consistent equations of motion and anomaly-free conserved vector current for the neutrinos. Axial vector currents for different Dirac fields may remain anomalous. The right-handed neutrinos can be useful to explain neutrino oscillation and dark matter. We will also discuss the possibility of introducing massless finite integer spin particles using second rank symmetric traceless tensors with reference to the corresponding little group in flat spacetime. We will show that we can use massless (A,A) type fields in Minkowski space to introduce massless finite integer spin particles.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Central Limit Theorem to Critical Systems: Revisiting Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Limit Theorem does not hold for strongly correlated stochastic variables, as is the case for statistical systems close to criticality. Recently, the calculation of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the magnetization mode has been performed with the functional renormalization group in the case of the three-dimensional Ising model [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)]. It has been shown in that article that there exists an entire family of universal PDFs parameterized by $\zeta=\lim_{L,\xi_\infty\rightarrow\infty} L/\xi_\infty$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed perturbatively in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion. We determine the whole family of universal PDFs and show that they are in good qualitative agreement with Monte Carlo data. Finally, we conjecture on how to significantly improve the quantitative agreement between the one-loop and the numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model is often employed to describe strongly-coupled baryonic and isospin-asymmetric matter, for example in the context of neutron stars. Here we consider the case of vanishing baryon chemical potential, where detailed comparisons to data from lattice QCD are possible. To this end, we extend previous works by including a realistic pion mass and pion condensation into the decompactified limit of the model and evaluate the system for arbitrary isospin chemical potentials and temperatures. After suitably fixing the 3 parameters of the model, we find that the overall phase structure is in excellent agreement with lattice results. This also holds for observables at low temperatures in the strongly coupled regime, while we discover and discuss some discrepancies at large temperatures. Our findings give reassurance for the validity of previous and future applications of this model and highlight the aspects where improvements are needed.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a new relation between the basic representation of split real simply-laced affine Kac-Moody algebras and finite dimensional representations of its maximal compact subalgebra $\mathfrak{k}$. We provide infinitely many $\mathfrak{k}$-subrepresentations of the basic representation and we prove that these are all the finite dimensional $\mathfrak{k}$-subrepresentations of the basic representation such that the quotient of the basic representation by the subrepresentation is a finite dimensional representation of a certain parabolic algebra and of the maximal compact subalgebra. By this result we provide an infinite composition series with a cosocle filtration of the basic representation. Finally, we present examples of the results and applications to supergravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the concept of symplectic computers, which have the potential to be more powerful than quantum computers. Unlike quantum computing, which consists of a sequence of unitary transformations (gates) and projectors (measurements), symplectic computation involves a sequence of symplectic transformations and measurements.
  The proposal to explore symplectic computers is based on the following quantum-symplectic duality. The Schr\"odinger equation in its standard complex form describes the unitary evolution of a quantum system, while its real form describes the symplectic evolution of a classical mechanical system. This quantum-symplectic duality can be leveraged to enhance the capabilities of quantum and symplectic computers. In this symplectic approach, the role of a quantum bit (qubit) is taken by a symplectic bit (symbit).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper sets up a perturbative treatment of the evolving quantum state of a gravitational system, in a Schr\"odinger-like picture, working about a general background. This connects gauge symmetry, the constraints, gravitational dressing, and evolution. Starting with a general time slicing, we give a simple derivation of the relation between the constraints, the hamiltonian, and its well-known boundary term. Among different approaches to quantization with constraints, we focus on a "gauge-invariant canonical quantization," which is developed perturbatively in the gravitational coupling. The leading-order solution of the constraints (including the Wheeler-DeWitt equation) for perturbations about the background is given in terms of an explicit construction of gravitational dressings built using certain generalized Green functions; different such dressings corresponding to adding propagating gravitational waves to a particular solution of the constraints. Dressed operators commute with the constraints, expressing their gauge invariance, and have an algebraic structure differing significantly from the undressed operators of the underlying field theory. These operators can act on the vacuum to create dressed states, and evolution of general such states is then generated by the boundary hamiltonian, and alternately may be characterized using other relational observables. This provides a concrete approach to studying perturbative time evolution, including the leading gravitational backreaction, of quantum states of black holes with flat or anti de Sitter asymptotics, for example on horizon-crossing slices. This description of evolution in turn provides a starting point for investigating possibly important corrections to quantum evolution, that go beyond quantized general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The butterfly velocity of four-dimensional rotating charged asymptotically AdS black hole is calculated to probe chaos using localized rotating shock waves. In this work, we obtain the angular momentum dependence of the butterfly velocity due to rotation in the shock wave probes. In general, the angular momentum $\mathcal{L}$ of the shock waves increases the butterfly velocity. The localized shocks also generate butterfly velocities which vanish when we approach extremality, indicating no entanglement spread near extremality. One of the butterfly velocity modes is well bounded by both the speed of light and the Schwarzschild-AdS result, while the other may become superluminal. Aside from the logarithmic behavior of the scrambling time which indicates chaos, the Lyapunov exponent is also positive and bounded by $\kappa=2\pi T_H/(1-\mu\mathcal{L})$. The Kerr-NUT-AdS and Kerr-Sen-AdS solutions and their ultraspinning versions are used as examples to attain a better understanding of the chaotic phenomena in rotating black holes, especially those with extra conserved charges.</description>

      <title>More on closed string effective actions at order $\alpha'^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in string theory has unveiled the discovery of NS-NS couplings in bosonic and heterotic effective actions at order $\alpha'^2$, which were achieved by imposing $O(1,1)$ symmetry on the circle reduction of classical effective actions. While the bosonic theory features 25 couplings, the heterotic theory encompasses 24 parity-even and 3 parity-odd couplings, excluding the pure gravity couplings. In this study, we redefine the even-parity couplings in the bosonic and heterotic theories through the application of appropriate field redefinitions, resulting in 10 and 8 couplings, respectively. To establish the validity of these couplings, a cosmological reduction is conducted, demonstrating that the cosmological couplings in the heterotic theory vanish, subject to one-dimensional field redefinitions that include the lapse function and total derivative terms. Additionally, it is observed that the cosmological couplings in the bosonic theory can be expressed as $\mathrm{tr}(\dS^6)$. These results are consistent with existing literature, where such behavior is attributed to the pure gravity component of the couplings. Furthermore, the consistency of the obtained couplings with 4-point string theory S-matrix elements is confirmed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behavior of entanglement properties in the QCD phase diagram using holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) models. We consider two representative holographic QCD models and examine various entanglement measures, including entanglement entropy, conditional mutual information, and entanglement of purification. We find that the entanglement entropy obtained using the direct UV-cutoff renormalization method shows significant dependence on the specific model being used. However, the outcomes of other non-divergent entanglement measures, such as cutoff-independent entanglement entropy, conditional mutual information, and entanglement of purification, exhibit congruence in our calculations. When we focus specifically on the temperature range below $300$ MeV, we observe a similar behavior among the three entanglement measures. This may suggests that within this temperature range, the entanglement of QCD matter decreases with increasing temperature. Additionally, we observe distinct phase transition behaviors of entanglement properties at the critical end point (CEP) and first-order phase transitions. This observation highlights the potential of entanglement properties as effective order parameters for QCD matter phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We consider higher-order derivative gauge field corrections that arise in the fundamental context of dimensional reduction of String Theory and Lovelock-inspired gravities and obtain an exact and asymptotically flat black-hole solution, in the presence of non-trivial dilaton configurations. Specifically, by considering the gravitational theory of Euler-Heisenberg non-linear electrodynamics coupled to a dilaton field with specific coupling functions, we perform an extensive analysis of the characteristics of the black hole, including its geodesics for massive particles, the energy conditions, thermodynamical and stability analysis. The inclusion of a dilaton scalar potential in the action can also give rise to asymptotically (A)dS spacetimes and an effective cosmological constant. Moreover, we find that the black hole can be thermodynamically favored when compared to the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black hole for those parameters of the model that lead to a larger black-hole horizon for the same mass. Finally, it is observed that the energy conditions of the obtained black hole are indeed satisfied, further validating the robustness of the solution within the theoretical framework, but also implying that this self-gravitating dilaton-non-linear-electrodynamics system constitutes another explicit example of bypassing modern versions of the no-hair theorem without any violation of the energy conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the first class constraints that describe the infinite spin irreducible $4D$ Poincar\'{e} group representation in flat space to new first class constraints in $AdS_4$ space. The constraints are realized as operators acting in Fock space spanned by the creation and annihilation operators with two-component spinor indices. As a result, we obtain a new closed gauge algebra on $AdS_4$ with the known flat space limit. Using this gauge algebra, we construct the BRST charge and derive the Lagrangian and gauge transformations for free bosonic infinite spin field theory in $AdS_4$ space.</description>

      <title>The semi-classical saddles in three-dimensional gravity via holography and mini-superspace approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the complex geometries dual to the semi-classical saddles in three-dimensional gravity with positive or negative cosmological constant. We examine the semi-classical saddles in Liouville field theory and interpret them in terms of gravity theory. For this, we describe the gravity theory by Chern Simons theory and classify the possible saddles based on homotopy group argument. We further realize the semi-classical saddles using the mini-superspace model of quantum gravity and explicitly determine the integral contour. In the case of positive cosmological constant, we recovered the geometry used for no-boundary proposal of Hartle and Hawking. In the case of negative cosmological constant, the geometry can be identified with Euclidean anti-de Sitter space attached with imaginary radius spheres. The geometry should be unphysical and several arguments on this issue are provided. Partial results were already presented in our earlier letter, and more detailed derivations and explanations on the results are given along with additional results. In particular, we reproduce the classical Liouville action from the Chern-Simons formulation of dual gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Axions in the Dark Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark dimension scenario, which is motivated from Swampland principles and predicts a single micron scale extra dimension, suggests a consistent framework for the dark sector of the universe. We consider the implications of this scenario for the QCD axion. We find that in the scenario in which the axion is localized on the standard model brane (which we will argue is natural), a combination of theoretical (being bounded by the 5D Planck mass) and observational constraints forces it to have decay constant in a narrow range $f \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$ GeV. This corresponds to a mass for the QCD axion of $m_a \sim (1 - 10)$ meV. The axion mass surprisingly coincides with the mass scale for the dark energy, the dark matter tower, and the neutrinos. In this scenario axions are not expected to form a large fraction of the dark matter but nevertheless this range of axion parameters is accessible to observations in near future experiments.</description>

      <title>Casimir energy on the sphere and 6D CFT trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the dependence of the Casimir energy on the trace anomaly coefficients for a six-dimensional CFT on $R\times S^5$. This extends the universal dependence on the central charge in 2D and the relation by Cappelli and Coste in 4D, unveiling the role of the trivial total derivatives in the anomaly that renders the Casimir energy scheme dependent. We obtain
  $$E_o=-\frac{15}{8}\,a_6 -\frac{5}{12}\,\left(g_5+\frac{1}{4}\,g_7+\frac{1}{2}\,g_8-10\, g_9+g_{10}\right),$$ with $a_6$ being the type A central charge and the $g$'s, the coefficients of five out of six terms that form a basis for trivial total derivatives. The derivation is based on the Polyakov formulas (conformal primitive) resulting from the integration of the trace anomaly.
  Alternatively, on a 6D conformally flat background the above basis is redundant and one can simplify further to get, in terms of the Schouten scalar $J$ and the Schouten tensor $V$, Branson's basis for trivial total derivatives $\nabla^2\nabla^2 J$, $\nabla^2J^2$ and $\nabla^2|V|^2+2\nabla\cdot(V\cdot\nabla\,J)$ with coefficients $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$, respectively, \begin{equation} \nonumber
  E_o=-\frac{15}{8}a_6-\frac{1}{24}\left(\gamma_1-\gamma_2 -\frac{1}{8}\gamma_3\right)~. \end{equation}</description>

      <title>Four loop renormalization in six dimensions using Forcer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the Forcer algorithm to renormalize a variety of six dimensional field theories to four loops. In order to achieve this we construct the Forcer master integrals in six dimensions from their four dimensional counterparts by using the Tarasov method. The $\epsilon$ expansion of the six dimensional masters are determined up to weight $9$ where $d$ $=$ $6$ $-$ $2\epsilon$. By applying the Forcer routine the four loop MSbar renormalization of $\phi^3$ theory is reproduced before gauge theories are considered. The renormalization of these theories is also determined in the MOMt scheme. For instance the absence of $\zeta_4$ and $\zeta_6$ is confirmed to five loops in the MOMt renormalization of $\phi^3$ theory. We also evaluate the three loop $\beta$-function of the gauge coupling in six dimensional QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field theoretical tools are developed so that one can analyze quantum phenomena such as transition radiation that must have occurred during the Higgs condensate bubble expansion through plasma in the early universe. Integral representations of Bosonic and Fermionic propagators are presented for the case that particle masses are varied continuously during the passage through the bubble wall interface between symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken regions. The construction of propagators is based on the so-called eigenfunction expansion method associated with self-adjoint differential operators, developed by Weyl, Stone, Titchmarsh, Kodaira and several others. A novel method of field quantization in the presence of the bubble wall is proposed by using the spectral functions introduced in constructing the two-point Green's functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quantization of Carrollian conformal scalar theories, including two-dimensional(2D) magnetic scalar and three-dimensional(3D) electric and magnetic scalars. We discuss two different quantization schemes, depending on the choice of the vacuum. We show that the standard canonical quantization corresponding to the induced vacuum yields a unitary Hilbert space and the 2-point correlation functions in this scheme match exactly with the ones computed from the path integral. In the canonical quantization, the BMS symmetry can be realized without anomaly. On the other hand, for the quantization based on the highest-weight vacuum, it does not have a unitary Hilbert space. In 2D, the correlators in the highest-weight vacuum agree with the ones obtained by taking the $c\to 0$ limit of the 2D CFT, and there is an anomalous term in the commutation relations between the Virasoso generators, whose form is similar to the one in 2D CFT. In 3D, there is no good definition of the highest-weight vacuum without breaking the rotational symmetry. In our study, we find that the usual state-operator correspondence in CFT does not hold in the Carrollian case.</description>

Abstract: The moduli space of covariantly constant gauge fields is infinite-dimensional and describes non-perturbative solutions of the Yang-Mills equation of superposed chromomagnetic flux tubes (vortices) of opposite magnetic charges. These gauge field configurations are stretched along the potential valleys of a constant energy density and are separated by potential barriers between classically degenerate vacua that are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of dense chromomagnetic vortices representing a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. The solutions represent exact non-perturbative solutions of the YM equation in the background chromomagnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantization of the canonical unshifted Poisson structure on the derived cotangent stack $T^\ast[X/G]$ of a quotient stack, where $X$ is a smooth affine scheme with an action of a (reductive) smooth affine group scheme $G$. This is achieved through an {\'e}tale resolution of $T^\ast[X/G]$ by stacky CDGAs that allows for an explicit description of the canonical Poisson structure on $T^\ast[X/G]$ and of the dg-category of modules quantizing it. These techniques are applied to construct a dg-category-valued prefactorization algebra that quantizes a gauge theory on directed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A study of strongly curved graphene magnetization and magnetic susceptibility is carried out. Through a Dirac model complemented with a tight-binding model analysis, we are able to show that mechanical deformations solve the long-standing problem of graphene's theoretically calculated diamagnetic divergence at low temperatures. This suggests that corrugations and mechanical defects in graphene are the cause of finite experimentally measurable magnetic susceptibility. Furthermore, a mechanical effect is also found due to an electronic contribution, which produces a pseudo-de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) effect. This effect is related to oscillating (electronic) forces that oppose deformations; these forces are divergent in flat graphene, indicating that graphene (without substrate) achieves mechanical equilibrium by corrugations. In addition, paramagnetism is predicted for graphene with negative curvature under strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate cosmological perturbation theory around the spatially curved FLRW background in the context of metric-affine gauge theory of gravity which includes torsion and nonmetricity. Performing scalar-vector-tensor decomposition of the spatial perturbations, we find that the theory displays a rich perturbation spectrum with helicities 0, 1, 2 and 3, on top of the usual scalar, vector and tensor metric perturbations arising from Riemannian geometry. Accordingly, the theory provides a diverse phenomenology, e.g. the helicity-2 modes of the torsion and/or nonmetricity tensors source helicity-2 metric tensor perturbation at the linear level leading to the production of gravitational waves. As an immediate application, we study linear perturbation of the nonmetricity helicity-3 modes for a general parity-preserving action of metric-affine gravity which includes quadratic terms in curvature, torsion, and nonmetricity. We then find the conditions to avoid possible instabilities in the helicity-3 modes of the spin-3 field.</description>

Abstract: We compute the two-loop master integrals for leading-color QCD scattering amplitudes including a closed light-quark loop in $t\bar{t}H$ production at hadron colliders. Exploiting numerical evaluations in modular arithmetic, we construct a basis of master integrals satisfying a system of differential equations in $\epsilon$-factorized form. We present the analytic form of the differential equations in terms of a minimal set of differential one-forms. We explore properties of the function space of analytic solutions to the differential equations in terms of iterative integrals which can be exploited for studying the analytic form of related scattering amplitudes. Finally, we solve the differential equations using generalized series expansions to numerically evaluate the master integrals in physical phase space. As the first computation of a set of two-loop seven-scale master integrals, our results provide valuable input for analytic studies of scattering amplitudes in processes involving massive particles and a large number of kinematic scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation and absorption of plasma waves in the context of the Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw (MCFJ) electrodynamics with a purely spacelike background playing the role of the anomalous Hall conductivity, concerning the anomalous Hall current. Such a current is also found in an axion field which increases linearly with a space coordinate. The Maxwell equations are rewritten for a cold, uniform, and collisionless fluid plasma model, allowing us to determine the new refractive indices and propagating modes. The analysis begins for propagation along the magnetic axis, examined in the cases of chiral vectors parallel and orthogonal to the magnetic field. Two distinct refractive indices (associated with right-handed circularly polarized [RCP] and left-handed circularly polarized [LCP] waves) are obtained and the associated propagation and absorption zones are determined. The low-frequency regime is discussed and we obtain RCP and LCP helicons. We scrutinize optical effects, such as birefringence and dichroism, and observe rotatory power sign reversion, a property of chiral MCFJ plasmas. We also examine the case of transversal propagation in the direction orthogonal to the magnetic field, providing much more involved results.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark energy with the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, by now detectable at $\sim 5\sigma$ within the context of $\Lambda{}$CDM cosmologies, to place strong constraints on dynamical dark energy theories. Working within an effective field theory framework for dark energy we find that including ISW constraints from galaxy-CMB cross-correlations significantly strengthens existing large-scale structure constraints, yielding bounds consistent with $\Lambda{}$CDM and approximately reducing the viable parameter space by $\sim 70\%$. This is a direct consequence of ${\cal O}(1)$ changes induced in these cross-correlations by otherwise viable dark energy models, which we discuss in detail. We compute constraints by adapting the $\Lambda{}$CDM ISW likelihood from [1] for dynamical dark energy models using galaxy data from 2MASS, WISE $\times$ SuperCOSMOS, SDSS-DR12, QSOs and NVSS, CMB data from Planck 18, and BAO and RSD large scale structure measurements from BOSS and 6dF. We show constraints both in terms of EFT-inspired $\alpha_i$ and phenomenological $\mu/\Sigma$ parametrisations. Furthermore we discuss the approximations involved and related aspects of bias modelling in detail and highlight what these constraints imply for the underlying dark energy theories.</description>

Abstract: Early observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed the existence of an unexpectedly large abundance of extremely massive galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$: these observations are in tension with the predictions not only of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, but also with those of a wide class of dynamical dark energy (DE) models, and are generally in better agreement with models characterized by a phantom behaviour. Here we consider a model, inspired by string theory and the ubiquity of anti-de Sitter vacua therein, featuring an evolving DE component with positive energy density on top of a negative cosmological constant, argued in an earlier exploratory analysis to potentially be able to explain the JWST observations. We perform a robust comparison of this model against JWST data, considering both photometric observations from the CEERS program, and spectroscopic observations from the FRESCO survey. We show that the model is able to accommodate the JWST observations, with a consistency probability of up to $98\%$, even in the presence of an evolving component with a quintessence-like behaviour (easier to accommodate theoretically compared to phantom DE), while remaining consistent with standard low-redshift probes. Our results showcase the tremendous potential of measurements of high-redshift galaxy abundances in tests of fundamental physics, and their valuable complementarity with standard cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Infinite Order Hydrodynamics: An Analytical Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a kinetic model for matter-radiation interactions whose hydrodynamic gradient expansion can be computed analytically up to infinite order in derivatives, in the fully nonlinear regime, and for arbitrary flows. The frequency dependence of the opacity of matter is chosen to mimic the relaxation time of a self-interacting scalar field. In this way, the transient sector simulates that of a realistic quantum field theory. The gradient series is found to diverge for most flows, in agreement with previous findings. We identify, for the model at hand, the mechanism at the origin of the divergence, and we provide a successful regularization scheme. Additionally, we propose a universal qualitative framework for predicting the breakdown of the gradient expansion of an arbitrary microscopic system undergoing a given flow. This framework correctly recovers all previously known instances of gradient expansion divergence. As a new prediction, we show that the gradient expansion diverges when the energy-dependent mean free path is unbounded above.</description>

      <title>Unitarity implications of \( \tilde{F}_{\mu\nu} \) and \( F_{\mu\nu} \) models with LIV in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18157v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied two different models that included LIV coupling in the scattering processes of \( e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-\). We found that using the model with the dual electromagnetic tensor \( \tilde{F}_{\mu\nu} \) resulted in violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. On the other hand, using the model with nonminimal coupling with \( F_{\mu\nu} \) preserved unitarity in both vector and axial cases. As a result, this could have significant implications, given that the nonminimal coupling model with the dual electromagnetic tensor \( \tilde{F}_{\mu\nu} \) appeared to be potentially superior to the electromagnetic tensor \( F_{\mu\nu} \). Therefore, we believe that these findings could provide a valuable guide for further exploration into the study of CPT and Lorentz breaking phenomena, with significant implications that are certainly nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretation of a nonlinear extension of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Scattering amplitudes in the Randall-Sundrum model with brane-localized curvature terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the scattering amplitudes of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in Randall-Sundrum models with brane-localized curvature terms. We show that the presence of brane-localized curvature interactions modifies the properties of (4D) scalar fluctuations of the metric, resulting in scattering amplitudes of the massive spin-2 KK states which grow as ${\cal O}(s^3)$ instead of ${\cal O}(s)$. We discuss the constraints on the size of the brane-localized curvature interactions based on the consistency of the Sturm-Liouville mode systems of the spin-2 and spin-0 metric fluctuations. We connect the properties of the scattering amplitudes to the diffeomorphism invariance of the compactified KK theory with brane-localized curvature interactions. We verify that the scattering amplitudes involving brane-localized external sources (matter) are diffeomorphism-invariant, but show that those for matter localized at an arbitrary point in the bulk are not. We demonstrate that, in Feynman gauge, the spin-0 Goldstone bosons corresponding to helicity-0 states of the massive spin-2 KK bosons behave as a tower of Galileons, and that it is their interactions that produce the high-energy behavior of the scattering amplitudes. We also outline the correspondence between our results and those in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model. In an appendix we discuss the analogous issue in extra-dimensional gauge theory, and show that the presence of a brane-localized gauge kinetic-energy term does not change the high-energy behavior of corresponding KK vector boson scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation in quantum Hall system with an expanding edge: application of anomaly method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between gravitational anomalies and Hawking radiation of black holes was revealed by Wilczek and Robinson. In this study, we apply their method to an analogue de Sitter spacetime in the quantum Hall system with an expanding edge. Because this system is chiral, there is no need to impose the condition of ingoing modes near the horizon, which was assumed in the original method. Moreover, this system is structured so that the de Sitter space is sandwiched between two flat spaces, and although the effects of the anomaly would not appear in an ordinal de Sitter spacetime, they manifest themselves as boundary conditions between the de Sitter and the flat regions. By performing calculations under these boundary conditions, we obtain the flux of Hawking radiation in the outer flat region with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the de Sitter horizon.</description>
