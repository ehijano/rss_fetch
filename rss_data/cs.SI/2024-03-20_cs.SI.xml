      <title>What makes a small-world network? Leveraging machine learning for the robust prediction and classification of networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to simulate realistic networks based on empirical data is an important task across scientific disciplines, from epidemiology to computer science. Often simulation approaches involve selecting a suitable network generative model such as Erd\"os-R\'enyi or small-world. However, few tools are available to quantify if a particular generative model is suitable for capturing a given network structure or organization. We utilize advances in interpretable machine learning to classify simulated networks by our generative models based on various network attributes, using both primary features and their interactions. Our study underscores the significance of specific network features and their interactions in distinguishing generative models, comprehending complex network structures, and forming real-world networks</description>

      <title>Dynamic Information Dissemination Model Incorporating Non-Adjacent Node Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing the dynamics of information dissemination within social networks poses a formidable challenge. Despite multiple endeavors aimed at addressing this issue, only a limited number of studies have effectively replicated and forecasted the evolving course of information dissemination. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DM-NAI, which not only considers the information transfer between adjacent users but also takes into account the information transfer between non-adjacent users to comprehensively depict the information dissemination process. Extensive experiments are conducted on six datasets to predict the information dissemination range and the dissemination trend of the social network. The experimental results demonstrate an average prediction accuracy range of 94.62% to 96.71%, respectively, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art solutions. This finding illustrates that considering information transmission between non-adjacent users helps DM-NAI achieve more accurate information dissemination predictions.</description>

      <title>USE: Dynamic User Modeling with Stateful Sequence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User embeddings play a crucial role in user engagement forecasting and personalized services. Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked interest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based user embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As users continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be periodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior patterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack memory of historical behavior. They have to either discard historical data and use only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both cases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we introduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and reflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing by storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior prediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting a broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors. By combining it with the Same User Prediction, a contrastive learning-based objective that predicts whether different segments of behavior sequences belong to the same user, we further improve the embeddings' distinctiveness and representativeness. We conducted experiments on 8 downstream tasks using Snapchat users' behavioral logs in both static (i.e., fixed user behavior sequences) and dynamic (i.e., periodically updated user behavior sequences) settings. We demonstrate USE's superior performance over established baselines. The results underscore USE's effectiveness and efficiency in integrating historical and recent user behavior sequences into user embeddings in dynamic user modeling.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing News Consumption on Social Media Platforms Using Large Language Models and Realistic Bot Accounts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization, declining trust, and wavering support for democratic norms are pressing threats to U.S. democracy. Exposure to verified and quality news may lower individual susceptibility to these threats and make citizens more resilient to misinformation, populism, and hyperpartisan rhetoric. This project examines how to enhance users' exposure to and engagement with verified and ideologically balanced news in an ecologically valid setting. We rely on a large-scale two-week long field experiment (from 1/19/2023 to 2/3/2023) on 28,457 Twitter users. We created 28 bots utilizing GPT-2 that replied to users tweeting about sports, entertainment, or lifestyle with a contextual reply containing two hardcoded elements: a URL to the topic-relevant section of quality news organization and an encouragement to follow its Twitter account. To further test differential effects by gender of the bots, treated users were randomly assigned to receive responses by bots presented as female or male. We examine whether our over-time intervention enhances the following of news media organization, the sharing and the liking of news content and the tweeting about politics and the liking of political content. We find that the treated users followed more news accounts and the users in the female bot treatment were more likely to like news content than the control. Most of these results, however, were small in magnitude and confined to the already politically interested Twitter users, as indicated by their pre-treatment tweeting about politics. These findings have implications for social media and news organizations, and also offer direction for future work on how Large Language Models and other computational interventions can effectively enhance individual on-platform engagement with quality news and public affairs.</description>

      <title>NELA-PS: A Dataset of Pink Slime News Articles for the Study of Local News Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pink slime news outlets automatically produce low-quality, often partisan content that is framed as authentic local news. Given that local news is trusted by Americans and is increasingly shutting down due to financial distress, pink slime news outlets have the potential to exploit local information voids. Yet, there are gaps in understanding of pink slime production practices and tactics, particularly over time. Hence, to support future research in this area, we built a dataset of over 7.9M articles from 1093 pink slime sources over 2.5 years.</description>

      <title>Community Needs and Assets: A Computational Analysis of Community Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A community needs assessment is a tool used by non-profits and government agencies to quantify the strengths and issues of a community, allowing them to allocate their resources better. Such approaches are transitioning towards leveraging social media conversations to analyze the needs of communities and the assets already present within them. However, manual analysis of exponentially increasing social media conversations is challenging. There is a gap in the present literature in computationally analyzing how community members discuss the strengths and needs of the community. To address this gap, we introduce the task of identifying, extracting, and categorizing community needs and assets from conversational data using sophisticated natural language processing methods. To facilitate this task, we introduce the first dataset about community needs and assets consisting of 3,511 conversations from Reddit, annotated using crowdsourced workers. Using this dataset, we evaluate an utterance-level classification model compared to sentiment classification and a popular large language model (in a zero-shot setting), where we find that our model outperforms both baselines at an F1 score of 94% compared to 49% and 61% respectively. Furthermore, we observe through our study that conversations about needs have negative sentiments and emotions, while conversations about assets focus on location and entities. The dataset is available at https://github.com/towhidabsar/CommunityNeeds.</description>

      <title>The Tribal Theater Model: Social Regulation for Dynamic User Adaptation in Virtual Interactive Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a social regulation model for dynamic adaptation according to user characteristics in virtual interactive environments, namely the tribal theater model. The model focuses on organizational regulation and builds an interaction scheme with more resilient user performance by improving the subjectivity of the user. This paper discusses the sociological theoretical basis of this model and how it was migrated to an engineering implementation of a virtual interactive environment. The model defines user interactions within a field that are regulated by a matrix through the allocation of resources. To verify the effectiveness of the tribal theater model, we designed an experimental scene using a chatroom as an example. We trained the matrix as an AI model using a temporal transformer and compared it with an interaction field with different levels of control. The experimental results showed that the tribal theater model can improve users' interactive experience, enhance resilient user performance, and effectively complete environmental interaction tasks under rule-based interaction.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Law Enforcement Training: A Gamified Approach to Detecting Terrorism Financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tools for fighting cyber-criminal activities using new technologies are promoted and deployed every day. However, too often, they are unnecessarily complex and hard to use, requiring deep domain and technical knowledge. These characteristics often limit the engagement of law enforcement and end-users in these technologies that, despite their potential, remain misunderstood. For this reason, in this study, we describe our experience in combining learning and training methods and the potential benefits of gamification to enhance technology transfer and increase adult learning. In fact, in this case, participants are experienced practitioners in professions/industries that are exposed to terrorism financing (such as Law Enforcement Officers, Financial Investigation Officers, private investigators, etc.) We define training activities on different levels for increasing the exchange of information about new trends and criminal modus operandi among and within law enforcement agencies, intensifying cross-border cooperation and supporting efforts to combat and prevent terrorism funding activities. On the other hand, a game (hackathon) is designed to address realistic challenges related to the dark net, crypto assets, new payment systems and dark web marketplaces that could be used for terrorist activities. The entire methodology was evaluated using quizzes, contest results, and engagement metrics. In particular, training events show about 60% of participants complete the 11-week training course, while the Hackathon results, gathered in two pilot studies (Madrid and The Hague), show increasing expertise among the participants (progression in the achieved points on average). At the same time, more than 70% of participants positively evaluate the use of the gamification approach, and more than 85% of them consider the implemented Use Cases suitable for their investigations.</description>

      <title>Sparsification of the regularized magnetic Laplacian with multi-type spanning forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a ${\rm U}(1)$-connection graph, that is, a graph where each oriented edge is endowed with a unit modulus complex number that is conjugated under orientation flip. A natural replacement for the combinatorial Laplacian is then the magnetic Laplacian, an Hermitian matrix that includes information about the graph's connection. Magnetic Laplacians appear, e.g., in the problem of angular synchronization. In the context of large and dense graphs, we study here sparsifiers of the magnetic Laplacian $\Delta$, i.e., spectral approximations based on subgraphs with few edges. Our approach relies on sampling multi-type spanning forests (MTSFs) using a custom determinantal point process, a probability distribution over edges that favours diversity. In a word, an MTSF is a spanning subgraph whose connected components are either trees or cycle-rooted trees. The latter partially capture the angular inconsistencies of the connection graph, and thus provide a way to compress the information contained in the connection. Interestingly, when the connection graph has weakly inconsistent cycles, samples from the determinantal point process under consideration can be obtained \`a la Wilson, using a random walk with cycle popping. We provide statistical guarantees for a choice of natural estimators of the connection Laplacian, and investigate two practical applications of our sparsifiers: ranking with angular synchronization and graph-based semi-supervised learning. From a statistical perspective, a side result of this paper of independent interest is a matrix Chernoff bound with intrinsic dimension, which allows considering the influence of a regularization -- of the form $\Delta + q \mathbb{I}$ with $q&gt;0$ -- on sparsification guarantees.</description>

      <title>FairSNA: Algorithmic Fairness in Social Network Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, designing fairness-aware methods has received much attention in various domains, including machine learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval. However, understanding structural bias and inequalities in social networks and designing fairness-aware methods for various research problems in social network analysis (SNA) have not received much attention. In this work, we highlight how the structural bias of social networks impacts the fairness of different SNA methods. We further discuss fairness aspects that should be considered while proposing network structure-based solutions for different SNA problems, such as link prediction, influence maximization, centrality ranking, and community detection. This paper clearly highlights that very few works have considered fairness and bias while proposing solutions; even these works are mainly focused on some research topics, such as link prediction, influence maximization, and PageRank. However, fairness has not yet been addressed for other research topics, such as influence blocking and community detection. We review state-of-the-art for different research topics in SNA, including the considered fairness constraints, their limitations, and our vision. This paper also covers evaluation metrics, available datasets, and synthetic network generating models used in such studies. Finally, we highlight various open research directions that require researchers' attention to bridge the gap between fairness and SNA.</description>

      <title>Analyzing User Engagement with TikTok's Short Format Video Recommendations using Data Donations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-format videos have exploded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Despite this, the research community lacks large-scale empirical studies into how people engage with short-format videos and the role of recommendation systems that offer endless streams of such content. In this work, we analyze user engagement on TikTok using data we collect via a data donation system that allows TikTok users to donate their data. We recruited 347 TikTok users and collected 9.2M TikTok video recommendations they received. By analyzing user engagement, we find that the average daily usage time increases over the users' lifetime while the user attention remains stable at around 45%. We also find that users like more videos uploaded by people they follow than those recommended by people they do not follow. Our study offers valuable insights into how users engage with short-format videos on TikTok and lessons learned from designing a data donation system.</description>

      <title>PAGE: Prototype-Based Model-Level Explanations for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aside from graph neural networks (GNNs) attracting significant attention as a powerful framework revolutionizing graph representation learning, there has been an increasing demand for explaining GNN models. Although various explanation methods for GNNs have been developed, most studies have focused on instance-level explanations, which produce explanations tailored to a given graph instance. In our study, we propose Prototype-bAsed GNN-Explainer (PAGE), a novel model-level GNN explanation method that explains what the underlying GNN model has learned for graph classification by discovering human-interpretable prototype graphs. Our method produces explanations for a given class, thus being capable of offering more concise and comprehensive explanations than those of instance-level explanations. First, PAGE selects embeddings of class-discriminative input graphs on the graph-level embedding space after clustering them. Then, PAGE discovers a common subgraph pattern by iteratively searching for high matching node tuples using node-level embeddings via a prototype scoring function, thereby yielding a prototype graph as our explanation. Using six graph classification datasets, we demonstrate that PAGE qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art model-level explanation method. We also carry out systematic experimental studies by demonstrating the relationship between PAGE and instance-level explanation methods, the robustness of PAGE to input data scarce environments, and the computational efficiency of the proposed prototype scoring function in PAGE.</description>

      <title>Machine-Made Media: Monitoring the Mobilization of Machine-Generated Articles on Misinformation and Mainstream News Websites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09820v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have gained traction, an increasing number of news websites have begun utilizing them to generate articles. However, not only can these language models produce factually inaccurate articles on reputable websites but disreputable news sites can utilize LLMs to mass produce misinformation. To begin to understand this phenomenon, we present one of the first large-scale studies of the prevalence of synthetic articles within online news media. To do this, we train a DeBERTa-based synthetic news detector and classify over 15.46 million articles from 3,074 misinformation and mainstream news websites. We find that between January 1, 2022, and May 1, 2023, the relative number of synthetic news articles increased by 57.3% on mainstream websites while increasing by 474% on misinformation sites. We find that this increase is largely driven by smaller less popular websites. Analyzing the impact of the release of ChatGPT using an interrupted-time-series, we show that while its release resulted in a marked increase in synthetic articles on small sites as well as misinformation news websites, there was not a corresponding increase on large mainstream news websites.</description>

      <title>NetInfoF Framework: Measuring and Exploiting Network Usable Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a node-attributed graph, and a graph task (link prediction or node classification), can we tell if a graph neural network (GNN) will perform well? More specifically, do the graph structure and the node features carry enough usable information for the task? Our goals are (1) to develop a fast tool to measure how much information is in the graph structure and in the node features, and (2) to exploit the information to solve the task, if there is enough. We propose NetInfoF, a framework including NetInfoF_Probe and NetInfoF_Act, for the measurement and the exploitation of network usable information (NUI), respectively. Given a graph data, NetInfoF_Probe measures NUI without any model training, and NetInfoF_Act solves link prediction and node classification, while two modules share the same backbone. In summary, NetInfoF has following notable advantages: (a) General, handling both link prediction and node classification; (b) Principled, with theoretical guarantee and closed-form solution; (c) Effective, thanks to the proposed adjustment to node similarity; (d) Scalable, scaling linearly with the input size. In our carefully designed synthetic datasets, NetInfoF correctly identifies the ground truth of NUI and is the only method being robust to all graph scenarios. Applied on real-world datasets, NetInfoF wins in 11 out of 12 times on link prediction compared to general GNN baselines.</description>
