      <title>Algebraic Structures in Microtonal Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will discuss how certain group theory structures are found in music theory. Western music splits the octave into 12 equal tones called half-steps. We can take this division further and split the octave into 24 equal tones by splitting each half-step in two, called a quarter-step. By assigning each of these 24 notes a number, we can discuss musical actions mathematically. In this paper, we analyze 24-tone microtonal music and explore how musical and harmonic structures in this system can be interpreted in terms of group-theoretic structures. This work extends the study by Crans, Fiore, and Satyendra.</description>

      <title>Advanced linear algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to advanced linear algebra, with emphasis on geometric aspects, and with some applications included too. We first review basic linear algebra, notably with the spectral theorem in its general form, and with the theory of the resultant and discriminant. Then we discuss the Jordan form and its basic applications to physics, and other advanced decomposition results for the matrices. We then go into positivity topics, involving matrices and bilinear forms, and with a look into curved space-time, and discrete Laplacians. Finally, we discuss the various groups of matrices, with a look at reflection groups, Lie groups, spin matrices, and random matrices.</description>

      <title>An old number theory problem related to the Legendre symbol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is using a very simple constructive method to study an old number theory problem related to the Legendre symbol modulo p, and completely solved it. The proving method of the result is purely elementary and has been desired in the literature at least since 1927.</description>

      <title>Meaning as Use, Application, Employment, Purpose, Usefulness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arising from the whole body of Wittgenstein's writings is a picture of a (not necessarily straight, linear, but admittedly tireless) journey to come to terms with the mechanics of language as an instrument to conceive `reality' and to communicate an acquired conception of the `world'. The journey passes through mathematics, psychology, color perception, certainty, aesthetic, but, looking at it from a sort of birdview, it seems reasonable to say that these are all used as `test beds' for his reflections and `experimentations' towards an all encompassing perspective of such a fundamental gateway to human reasoning and life-revealing as language. Whatever labelling of Wittgenstein as a mystic, a logicist, a conventionalist, a skeptic, an anti-metaphysics, an anti-realist, a verificationist, a pragmatist, a behaviorist, and many others, does not seem to do justice to his absolute obsession with being a persistent `deep diver' into the nature of language. Working with an open and searchable account of the Nachlass has allowed us to identify important aspects of the philosopher's possible common line of thinking, in spite of changes of directions, some of them acknowledged by Wittgenstein himself. One of those aspects is the association of meaning with use, application, purpose, usefulness of symbols in language, which happens to show itself from the very beginning through to the very late writings. The German terms Gebrauch, Anwendung, \emph{Verwendung}, Zweck in relation to meaning, sense of signs, words, sentences, appear in several texts since the WW1 Notebooks (1914--1916) up until very late manuscripts from 1950--51.</description>
