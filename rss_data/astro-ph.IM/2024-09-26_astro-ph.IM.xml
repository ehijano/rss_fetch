      <title>Beyond CCDs: Characterization of sCMOS detectors for optical astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) detectors provide a highly competitive alternative to charge-coupled devices (CCDs), the latter of which have historically been dominant in optical imaging. sCMOS boast comparable performances to CCDs with faster frame rates, lower read noise, and a higher dynamic range. Furthermore, their lower production costs are shifting the industry to abandon CCD support and production in favour of CMOS, making their characterization urgent. In this work, we characterized a variety of high-end commercially available sCMOS detectors to gauge the state of this technology in the context of applications in optical astronomy. We evaluated a range of sCMOS detectors, including larger pixel models such as the Teledyne Prime 95B and the Andor Sona-11, which are similar to CCDs in pixel size and suitable for wide-field astronomy. Additionally, we assessed smaller pixel detectors like the Ximea xiJ and Andor Sona-6, which are better suited for deep-sky imaging. Furthermore, high-sensitivity quantitative sCMOS detectors such as the Hamamatsu Orca-Quest C15550-20UP, capable of resolving individual photoelectrons, were also tested. In-lab testing showed low levels of dark current, read noise, faulty pixels, and fixed pattern noise, as well as linearity levels above $98\%$ across all detectors. The Orca-Quest had particularly low noise levels with a dark current of $0.0067 \pm 0.0003$ e$^-$/s (at $-20^\circ$C with air cooling) and a read noise of $0.37 \pm 0.09$ e$^-$ using its standard readout mode. Our tests revealed that the latest generation of sCMOS detectors excels in optical imaging performance, offering a more accessible alternative to CCDs for future optical astronomy instruments.</description>

      <title>Novel understanding of Cosmological Phenomena using Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer unique probes of diverse cosmological phenomena due to their characteristic properties, including short duration timescale and high dispersion measure. This study investigates two distinct theoretical frameworks: the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) mechanism for ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) and fraction of dark matter in primordial mass black holes. We explore the hypothesis that ultra-high-frequency GWs could be responsible for FRB generation. Consequently, the detection of continuous GWs signal from the vicinity of an FRB by current or future detectors would disfavour merger-based FRB formation models and lend significant credence to the GZ theory, which postulates the existence of high-frequency GWs. Moreover, we examine the effects of modified gravity on the gravitational lensing of FRBs and thereby put constraints on the fraction of primordial mass black holes made up of dark matter. Our analysis suggests that modified gravity introduces a screening effect on lensing, analogous to the scattering effect by plasma on light rays. We further discuss the expected detection rates of FRBs as well as lensed FRBs with upcoming radio telescopes, primarily HIRAX.</description>

      <title>High Spectral Resolution Observations of Propynal (HCCCHO) towards TMC-1 from the GOTHAM Large Program on the Green Bank Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used new high spectral resolution observations of propynal (HCCCHO) towards TMC-1 and in the laboratory to update the spectral line catalog available for transitions of HCCCHO - specifically at frequencies lower than 30 GHz which were previously discrepant in a publicly available catalog. The observed astronomical frequencies provided high enough spectral resolution that, when combined with high-resolution (~2 kHz) measurements taken in the laboratory, a new, consistent fit to both the laboratory and astronomical data was achieved. Now with a nearly exact (&lt;1 kHz) frequency match to the J=2-1 and 3-2 transitions in the astronomical data, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, a best fit to the total HCCCHO column density of 7.28+4.08/-1.94 x 10^12 cm^-2 was found with a surprisingly low excitation temperature of just over 3 K. This column density is around a factor of 5 times larger than reported in previous studies. Finally, this work highlights that care is needed when using publicly available spectral catalogs to characterize astronomical spectra. The availability of these catalogs is essential to the success of modern astronomical facilities and will only become more important as the next generation of facilities come online.</description>

      <title>Calibration Measurements of the BICEP3 and BICEP Array CMB Polarimeters from 2017 to 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BICEP3 and BICEP Array polarimeters are small-aperture refracting telescopes located at the South Pole designed to measure primordial gravitational wave signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization, predicted by inflation. Constraining the inflationary signal requires not only excellent sensitivity, but also careful control of instrumental systematics. Both instruments use antenna-coupled orthogonally polarized detector pairs, and the polarized sky signal is reconstructed by taking the difference in each detector pair. As a result, the differential response between detectors within a pair becomes an important systematic effect we must control. Additionally, mapping the intensity and polarization response in regions away from the main beam can inform how sidelobe levels affect CMB measurements. Extensive calibration measurements are taken in situ every austral summer for control of instrumental systematics and instrument characterisation. In this work, we detail the set of beam calibration measurements that we conduct on the BICEP receivers, from deep measurements of main beam response to polarized beam response and sidelobe mapping. We discuss the impact of these measurements for instrumental systematics studies and design choices for future CMB receivers.</description>

      <title>A PyTorch Benchmark for High-Contrast Imaging Post Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets is a challenging task that involves distinguishing faint planetary signals from the overpowering glare of their host stars, often obscured by time-varying stellar noise known as "speckles". The predominant algorithms for speckle noise subtraction employ principal-based point spread function (PSF) fitting techniques to discern planetary signals from stellar speckle noise. We introduce torchKLIP, a benchmark package developed within the machine learning (ML) framework PyTorch. This work enables ML techniques to utilize extensive PSF libraries to enhance direct imaging post-processing. Such advancements promise to improve the post-processing of high-contrast images from leading-edge astronomical instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope and extreme adaptive optics systems.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. I. Introducing the GaiaPMEX tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia mission is expected to yield the detection of several thousands of exoplanets, perhaps at least doubling the number of known exoplanets. Although the harvest is expected to occur when the astrometric time series will be published with DR4 at the eve of 2026, the DR3 is already a precious database to search for exoplanet beyond 1 au. With this objective, we characterized multiple systems by exploiting two astrometric signatures derived from the DR3 astrometric solution of bright sources (G&lt;16). We have the proper motion anomaly, or PMa, for sources also observed with Hipparcos, and the excess of residuals in the RUWE and the astrometric excess noise (AEN). Those astrometric signatures give an accurate measurement of the astrometric motion of a source seen with Gaia, even in the presence of calibration and measurement noises. We found that they can allow identifying stellar binaries and hint to companions with a mass in the planetary domain. We introduce a tool called GaiaPMEX, that is able, for a given source, to model its astrometric signatures, by a photocenter orbit due to a companion with certain mass and semi-major axis (sma). Comparing to their actual measurements from the DR3 and Hipparcos, GaiaPMEX calculates a confidence map of the possible companion's mass and sma. The constraints on mass are, as expected, degenerate, but when allowed, coupling the use of PMa and RUWE, may significantly narrow the space of solutions. Thanks to combining Gaia and Hipparcos, planets are expected to be most frequently found within 1-10 au from their star, at the scale of Earth-to-Saturn orbits. In this range, exoplanets with mass down to 0.1 MJup are more favorably detected around M-dwarfs closer than 10 pc. Some fraction, if not all, of companions identified with GaiaPMEX may be characterized in the future using the astrometric time series that will be published with the DR4.</description>

      <title>Searching for substellar companion candidates with Gaia. II. A catalog of 9,698 planet candidate solar-type hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced a new tool called GaiaPMEX. It characterizes the mass and semi-major axis relative to the central star (sma) of a possible companion around any source observed with Gaia. It uses the value of RUWE, or, with both Gaia and Hipparcos, the value of proper motion anomaly (PMa), alone or combined with the RUWE. Our goal is to exploit the large volume of sources in Gaia's DR3 and find new exoplanet candidates. We wish to create a new input catalog of planet-candidate hosting systems to the disposal of future follow-up projects. Beyond G=14, this catalog would prepare the arrival of powerful instruments on the ELTs, that could include RV follow-up of faint stars and direct imaging of planets around main sequence Gyr-old stars. We used the mass-sma degenerate set of solutions obtained by GaiaPMEX from any value of RUWE to select a sample of bright (G&lt;16) Gaia sources whose companions could be planetary, with a mass &lt;13.5 MJup. It led us to identify a sample of 9,698 planet candidate hosting sources, whose companion may have a mass &lt;13.5 MJup in the range of 1-3-au sma. We identified 19 systems that are also reported in the Nasa exoplanet archive. We detected 8 substellar companions with a 1-3-au sma, initially discovered and characterised with RV and astrometry. Moreover, we found 6 transiting-planet systems and 2 wide-orbit systems for whom we predict the existence of supplementary companions. Focusing on the subsample of sources observed with Hipparcos, combining RUWE and PMa, we confirmed the identification of 4 new planetary candidate systems HD 187129, HD 81697, CD-42 883, and HD 105330. Given the degeneracy of mass-sma, many of the candidates in this 9,698 sources catalog might have a larger mass, in the brown-dwarf and stellar domain, if their sma departs from the 1-3-au range. The vetting of this large catalog will be the subject of future studies.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRISS and HST: Exploring the improved ability to characterise exoplanet atmospheres in the JWST era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble Space Telescope has been a pioneering instrument for studying the atmospheres of exoplanets, specifically its WFC3 and STIS instruments. With the launch of JWST, we are able to observe larger spectral ranges at higher precision. NIRISS/SOSS covers the range 0.6--2.8 microns, and thus can serve as a direct comparison to WFC3 (0.8--1.7 microns). We perform atmospheric retrievals of WFC3 and NIRISS transmission spectra of WASP-39 b in order to compare their constraining power. We find that NIRISS is able to retrieve precise H2O abundances that do not suffer a degeneracy with the continuum level, due to the coverage of multiple spectral features. We also combine these datasets with spectra from STIS, and find that challenges associated with fitting the steep optical slope can bias the retrieval results. In an effort to diagnose the differences between the WFC3 and NIRISS retrievals, we perform the analysis again on the NIRISS data cut to the same wavelength range as WFC3. We find that the water abundance is in strong disagreement with both the WFC3 and full NIRISS retrievals, highlighting the importance of wide wavelength coverage. Finally, we carry out mock retrievals on the different instruments, which shows further evidence of the challenges in constraining water abundance from the WFC3 data alone. Our study demonstrates the vast information gain of JWST's NIRISS instrument over WFC3, highlighting the insights to be obtained from our new era of space-based instruments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint observations in electromagnetic and gravitational waves shed light on the physics of objects and surrounding environments with extreme gravity that are otherwise unreachable via siloed observations in each messenger. However, such detections remain challenging due to the rapid and faint nature of counterparts. Protocols for discovery and inference still rely on human experts manually inspecting survey alert streams and intuiting optimal usage of limited follow-up resources. Strategizing an optimal follow-up program requires adaptive sequential decision-making given evolving light curve data that (i) maximizes a global objective despite incomplete information and (ii) is robust to stochasticity introduced by detectors/observing conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches allow agents to implicitly learn the physics/detector dynamics and the behavior policy that maximize a designated objective through experience. To demonstrate the utility of such an approach for the kilonova follow-up problem, we train a toy RL agent for the goal of maximizing follow-up photometry for the true kilonova among several contaminant transient light curves. In a simulated environment where the agent learns online, it achieves 3x higher accuracy compared to a random strategy. However, it is surpassed by human agents by up to a factor of 2. This is likely because our hypothesis function (Q that is linear in state-action features) is an insufficient representation of the optimal behavior policy. More complex agents could perform at par or surpass human experts. Agents like these could pave the way for machine-directed software infrastructure to efficiently respond to next generation detectors, for conducting science inference and optimally planning expensive follow-up observations, scalably and with demonstrable performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Experimental end-to-end demonstration of intersatellite absolute ranging for LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a gravitational wave detector in space. It relies on a post-processing technique named time-delay interferometry (TDI) to suppress the overwhelming laser frequency noise by several orders of magnitude. This algorithm requires intersatellite-ranging monitors to provide information on spacecraft separations. To fulfill this requirement, we will use on-ground observatories, optical sideband-sideband beatnotes, pseudo-random noise ranging (PRNR), and time-delay interferometric ranging (TDIR). This article reports on the experimental end-to-end demonstration of a hexagonal optical testbed used to extract absolute ranges via the optical sidebands, PRNR, and TDIR. These were applied for clock synchronization of optical beatnote signals sampled at independent phasemeters. We set up two possible PRNR processing schemes: Scheme 1 extracts pseudoranges from PRNR via a calibration relying on TDIR; Scheme 2 synchronizes all beatnote signals without TDIR calibration. The schemes rely on newly implemented monitors of local PRNR biases. After the necessary PRNR treatments (unwrapping, ambiguity resolution, bias correction, in-band jitter reduction, and/or calibration), Scheme 1 and 2 achieved ranging accuracies of 2.0 cm to 8.1 cm and 5.8 cm to 41.1 cm, respectively, below the classical 1 m mark with margins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Polstar small explorer concept is for an ultraviolet (UV) spectropolarimetry space telescope mission with a focus on massive star astrophysics. The instrument waveband will be from 115 nm - 286 nm for spectroscopy and 122 nm - 286 nm for polarimetry. All 4 Stokes parameters, IQUV, will be measured at a resolving power of R=20,000 (15 km/s velocity resolution). The telescope aperture will be 40 cm with an effective area of about 22 cm^2 at a reference wavelength of 150 nm. The thrust of the science goals will be to determine the astrophysics of angular momentum exchange and transport, and consequences for massive star properties and evolution. This includes the effects of rapid to critical rotation for individual stars (magnetic and non-magnetic), and the effects of mass transfer for massive binaries, including identification of stripped core stars. If selected by the NASA/SMEX program, Polstar would launch around 2031 and observe ~300 stars to achieve science goals. The mission will include a Guest Observer program to advance discovery in other areas of astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: Short-duration noise transients in LIGO and Virgo detectors significantly affect the search sensitivity of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, especially in the high mass region. In a previous work by the authors \cite{Joshi_2021}, a $\chi^2$ statistic was proposed to distinguish them, when modeled as sine-Gaussians, from non-spinning CBCs. The present work is an extension where we demonstrate the better noise-discrimination of an improved $\chi^2$ statistic -- called the optimized sine-Gaussian $\chi^2$ -- in real LIGO data. The extension includes accounting for the initial phase of the noise transients and use of a well-informed choice of sine-Gaussian basis vectors selected to discern how CBC signals and some of the most worrisome noise-transients project differently on them~\cite{sunil_2022}. To demonstrate this improvement, we use data with blip glitches from the third observational run (O3) of LIGO-Hanford and LIGO-Livingston detectors. Blips are a type of short-duration non-Gaussian noise disturbance known to adversely affect high-mass CBC searches. For CBCs, spin-aligned binary black hole signals were simulated using the \textsc{IMRPhenomPv2} waveform and injected into real LIGO data from the same run. We show that in comparison to the sine-Gaussian $\chi^2$, the optimized sine-Gaussian $\chi^2$ improves the overall true positive rate by around 6\% in a lower-mass bin ($m_1,m_2 \in [20,40]M_{\odot}$) and by more than 3\% in a higher-mass bin ($m_1,m_2 \in [60,80]M_{\odot}$). On the other hand, we see a larger improvement -- of more than 20\% -- in both mass bins in comparison to the traditional $\chi^2$.</description>

      <title>Minimally implicit methods for the numerical integration of the neutrino transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of many astrophysical systems is dominated by the interaction between matter and radiation such as photons or neutrinos. The dynamics can be described by the evolution equations of radiation hydrodynamics in which reactions between matter particles and radiation quanta couples the hydrodynamic equations to those of radiative transfer (see Munier &amp; Weaver (1986a) and Munier &amp; Weaver (1986b)). The numerical treatment has to account for their potential stiffness (e.g., in optically thick environments). In this article, we will present a new method to numerically integrate these equations in a stable way by using minimally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. With these methods, the inversion of the implicit operator can be done analytically, so the computational cost is equivalent to that of an explicit method. We strongly take into account the physical behavior of the evolved variables in the limit of the stiff regime in the derivation of the methods. We will show the results of applying these methods to the reactions between neutrinos and matter in some tests and also in realistic core-collapse supernovae simulations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 118 New Ultracool Dwarf Candidates Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 118 new ultracool dwarf candidates, discovered using a new machine learning tool, named \texttt{SMDET}, applied to time series images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We gathered photometric and astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and tangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class distribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T subdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young ultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any estimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were collected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5) and T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning tools as a new large-scale discovery technique.</description>
