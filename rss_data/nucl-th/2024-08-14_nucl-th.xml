      <title>Renormalized critical dynamics and fluctuations in model A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, we explore the stochastic and dissipative relaxational dynamics of a non-conserved order parameter in a $\lambda\varphi^4$ interaction. The cutoff of the theory is provided by the lattice spacing chosen for our numerical simulations. As a consequence, observables become dependent on that scale. We consider a possible first-order phase transition and an evolution close to a critical point. We demonstrate that using a lattice counterterm restores the expected behavior of the mean, variance and kurtosis: the mean and the variance become lattice spacing independent, and we recover the correct expectation value of the mean, the growth of the variance with the correlation length and the expected minimum in the kurtosis. Our findings hold true in equilibrium and during the dynamical relaxation, and therefore mark an important step towards a fully fluctuating fluid dynamical setup.</description>

      <title>Chemical freeze-out curve in heavy-ion collisions and the QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical freeze-out curve in heavy-ion collisions is investigated in the context of QCD critical point (CP) search at finite baryon densities. Taking the hadron resonance gas picture at face value, chemical freeze-out points at a given baryochemical potential provide a lower bound on the possible temperature of the QCD CP. We first verify that the freeze-out data in heavy-ion collisions are well described by a constant energy per particle curve, $E/N = \rm const$, under strangeness neutrality conditions ($\mu_S \neq 0$, $\mu_Q \neq 0$). We then evaluate the hypothetical freeze-out curve based on this criterion in the absence of strangeness neutrality ($\mu_S = 0$, $\mu_Q = 0$) and confront it with recent predictions on the CP location. We find that recent estimates based on Yang-Lee edge singularities from lattice QCD data on coarse lattices place the CP significantly below the freeze-out curve and are thus disfavored by the heavy-ion data. On the other hand, predictions based on functional methods and holography place the CP slightly above the freeze-out curve, indicating that the QCD CP may be located very close to the chemical freeze-out in A+A collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.5 \div 5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Application of the shift-invert Lanczos algorithm to a non-equilibrium Green function for transport problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Green's function theory and related methods are widely used to describe transport phenomena in many-body systems, but they often require a costly inversion of a large matrix. We show here that the shift-invert Lanczos method can dramatically reduce the computational effort. We apply the method to two test problems, namely a simple model Hamiltonian and to a more realistic Hamiltonian for nuclear fission. For a Hamiltonian of dimension 66103 we find that the computation time is reduced by a factor of 33 compared to the direct calculation of the Green's function.</description>

      <title>Radial oscillations of proto-neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate radial oscillations of proto-neutron stars, employing equations of state described by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory or the relativistic mean field model, and assuming isentropy and fixed lepton fractions for the internal structure. We calculate the eigenfrequencies and corresponding oscillation functions, which show different characteristics in different mass regions. In the low-mass region around 1.4 solar mass, the radial oscillation frequencies are lowered by large entropy and neutrino trapping, along with a reduction of the average adiabatic index. In the region close to the maximum mass, the fundamental oscillation frequency drops rapidly and vanishes at the maximum mass, in accordance with the critical stability criterion $\partial M /\partial \rho_c = 0$, as for cold neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The triton lifetime from nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a calculation of the triton $\beta$-decay lifetime using Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in the chiral expansion. By incorporating a non-perturbative treatment of the higher-order corrections, we achieve consistent predictions for the Fermi and Gamow-Teller matrix elements, which are crucial for determining the triton lifetime. Our results are consistent with earlier theoretical calculations, confirming the robustness of our approach. This study marks a significant advancement in the systematic application of NLEFT to nuclear $\beta$-decay processes, paving the way for future high-precision calculations in more complex nuclear systems. Additionally, we discuss potential improvements to our approach, including the explicit inclusion of two-pion exchange mechanisms and the refinement of three-nucleon forces. These developments are essential for extending the applicability of NLEFT to a broader range of nuclear phenomena, including neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Multiboson Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations for partially coherent sources in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multi-pion and multi-kaon Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) correlations for the partially coherent particle-emitting sources in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. A density-dependent longitudinal coherent emission length as well as a density-dependent transverse coherent emission length are introduced in calculating the multi-boson HBT correlation functions of the partially coherent sources. We compare the model results of three- and four-pion HBT correlation functions with experimental data in Pb-Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV, and investigate the influences of boson coherent emission on the multi-boson correlation functions of pion and kaon. We find that all of the three- and four-pion correlation functions of the partially coherent sources are consistent with experimental data. Coherent emission leads to the intercept decreases of the multi-boson correlation functions. The intercepts of the multi-kaon correlation functions of the partially coherent source are higher than those of the multi-pion correlation functions because the low kaon densities lead to smaller coherent emission lengths of kaon than those of pion. The intercepts of multi-boson correlation functions of partially coherent sources in high transverse momentum intervals are higher than those in low transverse momentum intervals because particle de Broglie wavelengths are small at high momenta.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification of optical models in fission fragment de-excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take the first step towards incorporating compound nuclear observables at astrophysically-relevant energies into the experimental evidence used to constrain optical models, by propagating the uncertainty in two global optical potentials, one phenomenological and one microscopic, to correlated fission observables using the Monte Carlo Hauser-Feshbach formalism. We compare to historic and recent experimental data, and find that the parametric optical model uncertainty in neutron-fragment correlated observables is significant in observables involving neutron energies and multiplicities. Different phenomenological and microscopic potentials disagree, both with experiment and with eachcother, which we attribute to the extrapolation of the phenomenological models away from stability, and to the limitations of the nuclear matter folding approach for the microscopic model. We comment on the role of the optical model in future efforts to globally optimize fission models.</description>

      <title>Production characteristics of light nuclei, hypertritons and $\Omega$-hypernuclei in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend an analytical nucleon coalescence model with hyperons to study productions of light nuclei, hypertritons and $\Omega$-hypernuclei in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. We derive the formula of the momentum distribution of two bodies coalescing into dibaryon states and that of three bodies coalescing into tribaryon states. We explain the available data of the coalescence factors $B_2$ and $B_3$, the transverse momentum spectra, the averaged transverse momenta, the yield rapidity densities, yield ratios of the deuteron, antihelium-3, antitriton, hypertriton measured by the ALICE collaboration, and give predictions of different $\Omega$-hypernuclei, e.g., $H(p\Omega^-)$, $H(n\Omega^-)$ and $H(pn\Omega^-)$. We find two groups of interesting observables, the averaged transverse momentum ratios of light (hyper-)nuclei to protons (hyperons) and the centrality-dependent yield ratios of theirs. The former group exhibits a reverse-hierarchy of the nucleus size, and the latter is helpful for the judgements of the nucleus production mechanism as well as the nucleus own size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Mathematica package AmpRed for the semi-automatic calculations of multi-loop Feynman amplitudes with high efficiency and precision. AmpRed implements the methods of integration by parts and differential equations in the Feynman-parameter representation. It allows for the calculations of general parametric integrals (which may not have momentum-space correspondences). Various user-friendly tools for multi-loop calculations, such as those to construct and solve differential equations for Feynman integrals, are provided. It can also deal with tensor algebras in non-relativistic field theories. Interfaces to some packages, like QGRAF and FOMR, are also provided.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group consistent treatment of color superconductivity in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is a popular effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff artifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order of the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et al. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of renormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and color-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we analyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate counterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the RG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional regularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities by the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called dSC phase within the melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical potentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Excitation by Near-Resonant Electron Transition in $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations are made for the nuclear excitation from the ground state to the 8 eV $^{229m}$Th isomer via near-resonant electron transitions in Sb-like ($q=39+$) thorium ions. The energy of the first excited atomic state ($J=7/2$) in the $^{229}$Th$^{39+}$ ion is estimated to be 8.308$\pm$0.011 eV, which is very close to the new reference value for the $^{229m}$Th nuclear isomer energy, 8.338$\pm$0.024 eV [Kraemer et al., Nature 617, 706 (2023)]. It was found that within the uncertainty range of both atomic and nuclear excitation energies, the rate of nuclear excitation by electron transition can vary by more than 20 orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that the upper theoretical limit for the $^{229m}$Th isomer excitation rate reaches an enormous value of $1.05\times10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$ at resonance ($\Delta=0$ meV). Additionally, it was shown that using an electron beam ion trap (EBIT), the production of the $^{229}$Th isomer can reach rates ranging from tenths to approximately $6\times10^{19}$ s$^{-1}$. Thus, EBIT experimental studies could serve as an extremely sensitive tool for the independent verification of the excitation energy of the isomeric state in the $^{229}$Th nucleus.</description>

      <title>Pion to photon transition form factor: Beyond valence quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the singly virtual transition form factor (TFF) for the $\pi^0\to\gamma^*\gamma$ process in the space-like region using the hard-scattering formalism within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework. This form factor is expressed in terms of the perturbatively calculable hard-scattering amplitudes (HSAs) and the light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion. We obtain the pion LFWFs by diagonalizing the light-front QCD Hamiltonian, which is determined for its constituent quark-antiquark and quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sectors with a three-dimensional confinement. We employ the HSAs up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the quark-antiquark Fock sector and leading order (LO) in the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sector. The NLO correction to the TFF in the quark-antiquark Fock sector is of the same order as the LO contribution to the TFF in the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sector. We find that while the quark-antiquark-gluon Fock sector has minimal effect in the large momentum transfer ($Q^2$) region, it has a noteworthy impact in the low-$Q^2$ region. Our results show that, after accounting for both Fock sectors, the TFF within the BLFQ framework aligns well with existing experimental data, particularly in the low $Q^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Spherical-oblate shape coexistence in $^{94}$Zr from a model-independent analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-lying states of $^{94}$Zr were investigated via low-energy multi-step Coulomb excitation. From the measured $\gamma$-ray yields, 13 reduced transition probabilities between low-spin states were determined, together with the spectroscopic quadrupole moments of the $2_{1,2}^+$ states. Based on this information, for the first time in the Zr isotopic chain, the shapes of the $0_{1,2}^+$ states including their deformation softness were inferred in a model-independent way using the quadrupole sum rules approach. The ground state of $^{94}$Zr possesses a rather diffuse shape associated with a spherical configuration, while the $0_2^+$ state is oblate and more strongly deformed. The observed features of shape coexistence in $^{94}$Zr are in agreement with Monte-Carlo shell-model predictions, and the present results are vital to refine the IBM-CM description of the Zr isotopes around $A\approx 100$ in terms of an intertwined quantum phase transition.</description>

Abstract: The Cd puzzle implies that the phonon excitation of a spherical nucleus should be questioned and refuted. For understanding this spherical-like $\gamma$-soft mode newly found experimentally, a possible answer was proposed recently in the SU3-IBM. In this paper, the evolutions of the normal states in $^{108-120}$Cd are investigated and compared with the experimental results. For better explaining the nearly zero B(E2) values between the $0_{2}^{+}$ state and the $2_{1}^{+}$ state, except for the SU(3) second-order and third-order Casimir operators, other SU(3) higher-order interactions are also considered in detail. It can be found that the results of theoretical fitting and experimental data agree well with simple parameter selection. The spherical-like spectra really exist. The deficiency may come from the lack of configuration mixing. The realistic spectra characteristics of the spherical-like spectra are found for $^{118,120}$Cd and the electric quadrupole moments of the $2_{1}^{+}$ state are predicted. The $Q_{2_{1}^{+}}$ anomaly in $^{108-116}$Cd are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Two-center harmonic oscillator basis for Skyrme-DFT calculations (I): formalism and Proof of Principle</title>

Abstract: We present a new method to solve the nuclear density functional theory (DFT) equations using a two-center harmonic oscillator basis, incorporating pairing and Coulomb interactions. The goal is to efficiently determine the fission and fusion configurations in nuclei. The Coulomb exchange terms are evaluated exactly, allowing for a novel approach to neck formation without the Slater approximation, which has been commonly used in space coordinate-based approaches. The new method has been implemented in the code {\sc hfodd}, enabling direct comparison with standard one-center solutions. This first paper focuses on deriving and implementing a methodology based on stable, precise, and exact applications of harmonic oscillator bases for the two fragments, which can either overlap or be separated by arbitrarily large distances. The implementation is tested on two proof-of-principle examples using light nuclei, specifically $^8$Be and $^{24}$Mg.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of Asymptotically Hot and Dense QCD Matter: AMY Formalism vs. A Modified Relaxation Time Approximation in 0-flavor SU(3) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the "modified" $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures associated with collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>

      <title>Investigating the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger observations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Diffusion model approach to simulating electron-proton scattering events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is a fast-growing area of research offering various avenues for exploration in high-energy nuclear physics. In this work, we explore the use of generative models for simulating electron-proton collisions relevant to experiments like CEBAF and the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). These experiments play a critical role in advancing our understanding of nucleons and nuclei in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom. The use of generative models for simulating collider events faces several challenges such as the sparsity of the data, the presence of global or event-wide constraints, and steeply falling particle distributions. In this work, we focus on the implementation of diffusion models for the simulation of electron-proton scattering events at EIC energies. Our results demonstrate that diffusion models can accurately reproduce relevant observables such as momentum distributions and correlations of particles, momentum sum rules, and the leading electron kinematics, all of which are of particular interest in electron-proton collisions. Although the sampling process is relatively slow compared to other machine learning architectures, we find diffusion models can generate high-quality samples. We foresee various applications of our work including inference for nuclear structure, interpretable generative machine learning, and searches of physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Small-$x$ Evolution: Exact Results in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05508v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the revised small-$x$ orbital angular momentum (OAM) evolution equations derived recently, based on an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant and $x$ the Bjorken $x$ variable) and the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. From our solution, we extract the small-$x$, large-$N_c$ expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions. Additionally, we determine the large-$N_c$ small-$x$ asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be
  \begin{align}
  \notag
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h},
  \end{align} with the intercept $\alpha_h$ the same as obtained in the small-$x$ helicity evolution, which can be approximated as $\alpha_h \approx 3.66074 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}$. This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally, we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Spatially oscillating correlation functions in $\left(2+1\right)$-dimensional four-fermion models: The mixing of scalar and vector modes at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the mixing of scalar and vector condensates produces spatially oscillating, but exponentially damped correlation functions in fermionic theories at finite density and temperature. We find a regime exhibiting this oscillatory behavior in a Gross-Neveu-type model that also features vector interactions within the mean-field approximation. The existence of this regime aligns with expectations based on symmetry arguments, that are also applicable to QCD at finite baryon density. We compute the phase diagram including both homogeneous phases and regions with spatially oscillating, exponentially damped correlation functions at finite temperature and chemical potential for different strengths of the vector coupling. Furthermore, we find that inhomogeneous condensates are disfavored compared to homogeneous ones akin to previous findings without vector interactions. We show that our results are valid for a broad class of $\left(2+1\right)$-dimensional models with local four-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>A machine learning-based study of open-charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: n proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions, the study of charm hadrons plays a pivotal role in understanding the QCD medium and provides an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interaction, as they are mostly produced in the early stages of collisions via hard partonic interactions. The lightest open-charm, $D^{0}$ meson ($c\Bar{u}$), can originate from two separate sources. The prompt $D^{0}$ originates from either direct charm production or the decay of excited open charm states, while the nonprompt stems from the decay of beauty hadrons. In this paper, using different machine learning (ML) algorithms such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest, an attempt has been made to segregate the prompt and nonprompt production modes of $D^{0}$ meson signal from its background. The ML models are trained using the invariant mass through its hadronic decay channel, i.e., $D^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+} K^{-}$, pseudoproper time, pseudoproper decay length, and distance of closest approach of $D^{0}$ meson, using PYTHIA8 simulated $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\rm{TeV}$. The ML models used in this analysis are found to retain the pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, and collision energy dependence. In addition, we report the ratio of nonprompt to prompt $D^{0}$ yield, the self-normalized yield of prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$ and explore the charmonium, $J/\psi$ to open-charm, $D^{0}$ yield ratio as a function of transverse momenta and normalized multiplicity. The observables studied in this manuscript are well predicted by all the ML models compared to the simulation.</description>
