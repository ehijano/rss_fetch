      <title>Eratosthenes sieve supports the $k$-tuple conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viewing Eratosthenes sieve as a discrete dynamic system, we show that every admissible instance of every admissible constellation of gaps arises and persists in Eratosthenes sieve. For an admissible constellation of length J, we show that its population across stages of the sieve is consistent with the Hardy and Littlewood estimates from 1923. This work strongly connects Eratosthenes sieve to the k-tuple conjecture, and it provides a compact notation, primorial coordinates, for tracking the locations of admissible instances for a constellation.</description>

      <title>Pair correlation: Variations on a theme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his groundbreaking work on pair correlation, Montgomery analyzed the distribution of the differences $\gamma'-\gamma$ between ordinates $\gamma$ of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis. In this paper, we extend his ideas along two distinct directions. First, we introduce an infinite two-parameter family of real weighting functions that generalize Montgomery's original weight $w$. Although these new weights give rise to pair correlation functions with different asymptotic behavior, they do not yield any new information about the simplicity of the zeros of the zeta function. Second, we extend Montgomery's approach to study the distribution of ordinate sums of the form $\Sigma\gamma=\gamma_1+\cdots+\gamma_\mu$. Our results suggest a natural generalization of the pair correlation conjecture for any integer $\mu\ge 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genestier--Lafforgue and Fargues--Scholze have constructed a semisimple local Langlands paramterization for reductive groups over equicharacteristic local fields. Assuming a version of the stable twisted trace formula for function fields, we prove the surjectivity of this parameterization for split groups in sufficiently large characteristic.</description>

      <title>Modularity theorems for abelian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the modularity of a positive proportion of abelian surfaces over $\mathbf{Q}$. More precisely, we prove the modularity of abelian surfaces which are ordinary at $3$ and are $3$-distinguished, subject to some assumptions on the $3$-torsion representation (a "big image" hypothesis, and a technical hypothesis on the action of a decomposition group at $2$). We employ a 2-3 switch and a new classicality theorem (in the style of Lue Pan) for ordinary $p$-adic Siegel modular forms.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ the ring of $p$-adic integers. Let $G$ denote the simple group of order 168, 504 or 360. In this paper, we study the structure of the $\chi$-part of a $\mathbb{Z}_p[\mathrm{Im}(\chi)][G]$-module come from ideal class groups, Artin $L$-functions and Iwasawa theory.</description>

      <title>On Diophantine properties for values of Dedekind zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Northcott and Bogomolov property for special values of Dedekind $\zeta$-functions at real values $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove, in particular, that the Bogomolov property is not satisfied when $\sigma \geq \frac{1}{2}$. If $\sigma &gt; 1$, we produce certain families of number fields having arbitrarily large degrees, whose Dedekind $\zeta$-functions $\zeta_K(s)$ attain arbitrarily small values at $s = \sigma$. On the other hand, if $\frac{1}{2} \leq \sigma \leq 1$, we construct suitable families of quadratic number fields, employing either Soundararajan's resonance method, which works when $\frac{1}{2} \leq \sigma &lt; 1$, or results on random Euler products by Granville and Soundararajan, and by Lamzouri, which work when $\frac{1}{2} &lt; \sigma \leq 1$. We complete the study by proving that the Dedekind $\zeta$ function together with the degree satisfies the Northcott property for every complex $s\in{\mathbb{C}}$ such that $\mathrm{Re}(s) &lt;0$, generalizing previous work of G\'en\'ereux and Lal\'in.</description>

      <title>Partial Resolution of the Erd\"os-Straus, Sierpinski, and Generalized Erd\"os-Straus Conjectures Using New Analytical Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a unified analytical approach leading to a partial resolution of the Erdos-Straus, Sierpinski conjectures, and their generalization. We introduce two new analytical formulas under specific conditions of divisibility and the existence of perfect squares. Under these conditions, the formulas verify the conjectures even for very large numerical values. Moreover, our method reduces the problem to the search for a suitable perfect square, thereby opening the way to a complete proof of these conjectures. Notably, our second formula significantly improves upon Mordell's work by demonstrating analytically the conjecture in the majority of cases where Mordell's approach fails. Furthermore, these formulas are highly versatile, as they provide, under the established conditions, a systematic method to decompose any fraction a/n into a sum of three Egyptian fractions. In conclusion, we present open questions and conjectures to the mathematical community regarding the generalization of these formulas.</description>

      <title>A Division Algorithm for the Gaussian Integers' Minimal Euclidean Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual division algorithms on $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ measure the size of remainders using the norm function. These rings are Euclidean with respect to several functions. The pointwise minimum of all Euclidean functions $f: R \setminus 0 \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ on a Euclidean domain $R$ is itself a Euclidean function, called the minimal Euclidean function and denoted by $\phi_R$. The integers, $\mathbb{Z}$, and the Gaussians, $\mathbb{Z}[i]$, are the only rings of integers of number fields for which we have a formula to compute their minimal Euclidean functions, $\phi_{\mathbb{Z}}$ and $\phi_{\mathbb{Z}[i]}$. This paper presents the first division algorithm for $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ relative to $\phi_{\mathbb{Z}[i]}$, empowering readers to perform the Euclidean algorithm on $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ using its minimal Euclidean function.</description>

      <title>Topologies on abelian groups and a topological five-lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we establish some results that involve topologizing exact sequences of abelian groups and derive, in particular, a new topological version of the classical Five-Lemma. These results will be applied in a forthcoming paper to generalizing Lichtenbaum-van Hamel's duality \cite{vH04} to (proper) singular varieties over a $p$-adic field. In such a topological-arithmetical context Pontryagin duality plays a central role and it becomes necessary to topologize hypercohomology groups of complexes of abelian sheaves so that certain long exact sequences of abelian groups become strict exact, i.e., exact in a topological sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue to study the relationship between the size of the sum of a set and the common energy of its subsets. We find a rather sharp subexponential dependence between the doubling constant of a set $A$ and the minimal common energy taken over all partitions of $A$ into two disjoint subsets. As an application, we give a proof of the well--known arithmetic regularity lemma with better dependence on parameters.</description>

      <title>Moment generating functions and moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Aistleitner, Gantert, Kabluchko, Prochno and Ramanan studied large deviation principles (LDPs) for lacunary trigonometric sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2 \pi n_k x)$, where the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ satisfies the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1} / n_k \geq q &gt; 1$ for $k \geq 1$. A crucial ingredient in their work were asymptotic estimates for the moment generating function (MGF) of such sums, which turned out to depend on the fine arithmetic structure of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ in an intricate way. In the present paper we carry out a detailed study of the MGF for lacunary trigonometric sums (without any structural assumptions on the underlying sequence, other than lacunarity), and we determine the sharp threshold where arithmetic effects start to play a role. As an application, we prove moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums, and show that the tail probabilities are in accordance with Gaussian behavior throughout the whole range between the central limit theorem and the LDP regime.</description>

Abstract: Let $K = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Associated to every $n$-element $B_h$ set $A = \{a_1,\ldots, a_n\}$ in $K$ is the $B_h$-vector $\mathbf{a} = (a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ in $K^n$. This paper proves that ``almost all'' $n$-element subsets of $K$ are $B_h$-sets in the sense that the set of all $B_h$-vectors is an open and dense subset of $K^n$.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of arithmetic billiards from a new perspective. We first raise a similar problem about reflecting lights inside grids. For the solution to this problem, we will give three proofs. Next, we consider a similar problem in plane grids and give its solution. Moreover, we extend this two problems to $p$-dimensional space, where $p\geq2$. In this process, we introduce two mappings about finite discrete sets, and get two finite abelian groups. In addition, we give the definition of circular sequences and consider some combinatorial properties of circular sequences.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete discretely valued field of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ with perfect residue field, and let $E$ be a finite extension of $\mathbf{Q}_p$ contained in $K$. We show that the category of prismatic $F$-crystals on $\mathcal{O}_K$ (relative to $E$ in a suitable sense) is equivalent to the category of $\mathcal{O}_E$-lattices in $E$-crystalline representations defined by Kisin--Ren, extending the main result of \cite{arxiv:2106.14735} in the case $E=\mathbf{Q}_p$. As a key ingredient in the proof, by adapting a lemma of Du--Liu, we prove a general full faithfulness result for certain vector bundles on the prismatic site, which simplifies and refines the key descent step in the approach of Bhatt--Scholze without invoking the Beilinson fibre sequence.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for $p$-adic Heights on Hyperelliptic Curves of Arbitrary Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an algorithm for computing Coleman--Gross (and hence Nekov\'a\v{r}) $p$-adic heights on hyperelliptic curves over number fields with arbitrary reduction type above $p$. This height is defined as a sum of local heights at each finite place and we use algorithms for Vologodsky integrals, developed by Katz and the second-named author, to compute the local heights above $p$. We also discuss an alternative method to compute these for odd degree genus 2 curves via $p$-adic sigma functions, via work of the first-named author. For both approaches one needs to choose a splitting of the Hodge filtration. A canonical choice for this is due to Blakestad in the case of an odd degree curve of genus $2$ that has semistable ordinary reduction at $p$. We provide an algorithm to compute Blakestad's splitting, which is conjecturally the unit root splitting for the action of Frobenius. We give several numerical examples, including the first worked quadratic Chabauty example in the literature for a curve with bad reduction.</description>

      <title>Artin-Schreier towers of finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a prime number $p$, we consider the tower of finite fields $F_p=L_{-1}\subset L_0\subset L_1\subset\cdots$, where each step corresponds to an Artin-Schreier extension of degree $p$, so that for $i\geq 0$, $L_{i}=L_{i-1}[c_{i}]$, where $c_i$ is a root of $X^p-X-a_{i-1}$ and $a_{i-1}=(c_{-1}\cdots c_{i-1})^{p-1}$, with $c_{-1}=1$. We extend and strengthen to arbitrary primes prior work of Popovych for $p=2$ on the multiplicative order of the given generator $c_i$ for $L_i$ over $L_{i-1}$. In particular, for $i\geq 0$, we show that $O(c_i)=O(a_i)$, except only when $p=2$ and $i=1$, and that $O(c_i)$ is equal to the product of the orders of $c_j$ modulo $L_{j-1}^\times$, where $0\leq j\leq i$ if $p$ is odd, and $i\geq 2$ and $1\leq j\leq i$ if $p=2$. We also show that for $i\geq 0$, the $\mathrm{Gal}(L_i/L_{i-1})$-conjugates of $a_i$ form a normal basis of $L_i$ over $L_{i-1}$. In addition, we obtain the minimal polynomial of $c_1$ over $F_p$ in explicit form.</description>

      <title>On the Grothendieck resolution for a certain finite flat commutative group scheme of order $p^{n}$ over an $\Bbb{F}_{p}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any commutative finite flat group scheme, Grothendieck constructed an embedding into some smooth group scheme. This embedding is called the Grothendieck resolution. Let $p$ be a prime number and $n$ a positive integer. In connection with the normal basis problems in the framework of group schemes proposed by Suwa and the author, we consider the Grothendieck resolution for a certain finite flat commutative group scheme of order $p^{n}$ over an $\Bbb{F}_{p}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Twisted triple product root numbers and a cycle of Darmon-Rotger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an algebraic cycle on the triple product of the prime level modular curve $X_0(p)$ with origins in work of Darmon and Rotger. It is defined over the quadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ ramified only at $p$ whose associated quadratic character $\chi$ is the Legendre symbol at $p$. We prove that it is null-homologous and describe actions of various groups on it. For any three normalised cuspidal eigenforms $f_1, f_2, f_3$ of weight $2$ and level $\Gamma_0(p)$, we prove that the global root number of the twisted triple product $L$-function $L(f_1\otimes f_2\otimes f_3\otimes \chi, s)$ is $-1$. Assuming conjectures of Beilinson and Bloch, and guided by the Gross-Zagier philosophy, this suggests that the Darmon-Rotger cycle could be non-torsion, although we do not currently have a proof of this.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of integral fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we inspect a surprising relationship between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $d &gt; 2$ is an integer. Inspired greatly by the elegance of the counting problems along with the very striking results of Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators in arithmetic statistics and by an interesting point-counting result of Narkiewicz on rational periodic points of $\varphi_{d, c}$ for any odd degree $d&gt;2$ in arithmetic dynamics, we prove that for any given prime integer $p\geq 3$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p, c}$ modulo $p$ is 3 or 0, as $p$ tends to infinity. Moreover, we also show that a density of $0\%$ of integer polynomials $\varphi_{p, c}(x)$ have three fixed points modulo $p$, as $c$ tends to infinity. Consequently, a density of $100\%$ of integer polynomials $f(x): = x^p -x + c$ induces odd prime degree-$p$ number fields $K_{f}:=\mathbb{Q}[x]\slash (f(x))$. Since every number field $K_{f}$ comes naturally with the ring $\mathcal{O}_{K_{f}}$ of integers, applying a density result of Bhargava-Shankar-Wang on our irreducible integer polynomials $f(x)$ yields that a density equal to $\zeta(2)^{-1}$ of monic polynomials $f(x)$ is such that $\mathbb{Z}[x]\slash (f(x))$ is the ring $\mathcal{O}_{K_{f}}$ of integers. Motivated by a conjecture of Hutz on rational periodic points of $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any given prime $p\geq 5$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove unconditionally that the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity. We again use the same counting machinery as in odd prime degree setting to then also deduce several statistical results.</description>

      <title>Modular Exercises for Four-Point Blocks -- I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.11125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known modular property of the torus characters and torus partition functions of (rational) vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) has been an invaluable tool for studying this class of theories. In this work we prove that sphere four-point chiral blocks of rational VOAs are vector-valued modular forms for the groups $\Gamma(2)$, $\Gamma_0(2)$, or $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. Moreover, we prove that the four-point correlators, combining the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic chiral blocks, are modular invariant. In particular, in this language the crossing symmetries are simply modular symmetries. This gives the possibility of exploiting the available techniques and knowledge about modular forms to determine or constrain the physically interesting quantities such as chiral blocks and fusion coefficients, which we illustrate with a few examples. We also highlight the existence of a sphere-torus correspondence equating the sphere quantities of certain theories ${\mathcal T}_s$ with the torus quantities of another family of theories ${\mathcal T}_t$. A companion paper will delve into more examples and explore more systematically this sphere-torus duality.</description>

      <title>Hyodo-Kato theory with syntomic coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.05694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to establish theories concerning $p$-adic analogues of Hodge cohomology and Deligne-Beilinson cohomology with coefficients in variations of mixed Hodge structures. We first study log overconvergent $F$-isocrystals as coefficients of Hyodo-Kato cohomology. In particular, we prove a rigidity property of Hain-Zucker type for mixed log overconvergent $F$-isocrystals. In the latter half of the article, we give a new definition of syntomic coefficients as coefficients of $p$-adic Hodge cohomology and syntomic cohomology, and prove some fundamental properties concerning base change and admissibility. In particular, we see that our framework of syntomic coefficients depends only on the choice of a branch of the $p$-adic logarithm, but not on the choice of a uniformizer of the base ring. The rigid analytic reconstruction of Hyodo-Kato map studied by Ertl and the author plays a key role throughout this article.</description>

      <title>Jumps of Jacobians via orthogonal canonical forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth, proper curve $C$ over a discretely valued field $k$, we equip the $k$-vector space $H^{0}(C,\omega_{C/k})$ with a canonical discrete valuation $v_{\mathrm{can}}$ which measures how canonical forms degenerate on regular integral models of $C$. More precisely, $v_{\mathrm{can}}$ maps a canonical form to the minimal value of its associated weight function, as introduced by Musta\c{t}\u{a}--Nicaise. Our main result states that $v_{\mathrm{can}}$ computes Edixhoven's jumps of the Jacobian of $C$ when evaluated in an orthogonal basis. As a byproduct, we deduce a short proof for the rationality of the jumps of Jacobians. We also show how $v_{\mathrm{can}}$ and the jumps can be computed efficiently for the class of $\Delta_v$-regular curves introduced by Dokchitser.</description>

      <title>Bordifications of the moduli spaces of tropical curves and abelian varieties, and unstable cohomology of $\mathrm{GL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\mathrm{SL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct bordifications of the moduli spaces of tropical curves and of tropical abelian varieties, and show that the tropical Torelli map extends to their bordifications. We prove that the classical bi-invariant differential forms studied by Cartan and others extend to these bordifications by studying their behaviour at infinity, and consequently deduce infinitely many new non-zero unstable cohomology classes in the cohomology of the general and special linear groups $\mathrm{GL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\mathrm{SL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$. In particular, we obtain a new and geometric proof of Borel's theorem on the stable cohomology of these groups.
  In addition, we completely determine the cohomology of the link of the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties within a certain range, and show that it contains the stable cohomology of the general linear group.
  In the process, we define new transcendental invariants associated to the minimal vectors of quadratic forms, and also show that a certain part of the cohomology of the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}_g(\mathbb{Z})$ admits the structure of a motive.
  In an appendix, we give an algebraic construction of the Borel-Serre compactification by embedding it in the real points of an iterated blow-up of a projective space along linear subspaces, which may have independent applications.</description>
