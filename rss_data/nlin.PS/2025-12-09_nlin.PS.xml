      <title>Isotropic extension of first-order wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropy of many one-dimensional and first-order-in-time (T$^1$) scalar wave equations (e.g., Korteweg-de Vries and Camassa-Holm) limits their physical completeness and applicability to bidirectional/high-dimensional systems. We define the T$^n\Lambda^m$ isotropic extension consisting of temporal order elevation and spatial tensorization, which is the only possible approach to eliminate anisotropy while preserving original solutions. Our analysis finds that the Burgers equation exhibits T$^{\mathbb{N}_+}\Lambda^{2\mathbb{N}+1}$ extensibility and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation exhibits the T$^{2\mathbb{N}_+}\Lambda^{2\mathbb{N}}$ extensibility. The T$^2\Lambda^0$ extension of the KdV equation leads to the corresponding isotropic T$^2$ equation (KdV$^2$) for shallow water dynamics, which is physically more complete and suitable for 2D generalization. In addition to inheriting all KdV solutions and conservation laws, the KdV$^2$ equation also provides linearly stable corrections to the Boussinesq equation. In contrast, the KdV-Burgers equation is inherently anisotropic as it fails to exhibit any T$^n\Lambda^m$ extensibility.</description>

      <title>Varied Branches of Nondegenerate Vector Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study on nondegenerate dark-bright-bright solitons in a three-component Manakov model with repulsive interactions reveals the existence of diverse branches of nondegenerate vector solitons. For fixed bright component particle numbers and a given soliton velocity, the nondegenerate dark-bright-bright solitons exhibit four distinct branches with different density profiles and phase distributions, comprising two positive mass branches and two negative mass branches. The energy-velocity dispersion relation of each pair of positive- and one negative-mass branches form a closed loop, resulting in two mutually independent loops for the soliton's overall dispersion. All soliton branches share a common maximal velocity, which is determined by the larger bright soliton particle number. Linear stability analysis shows that all these branches are stable against weak perturbations. Extending to an $N$-component Manakov system, the nondegenerate solitons have $2^{N-1}$ distinct branches, of which $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is positive mass and $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is negative mass. Each pair of positive- and negative-mass branches form a closed dispersion relation loop, so that the vector solitons have $2^{N-2}$ disjoint loops. These results uncover the rich branches and interesting dispersion relations of nondegenerate vector solitons in multi-component models.</description>

      <title>Solitons in Quasi-Neutral non-Equilibrated Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an experiment performed in November 2022 at the one-petawatt (PW) laser facility Vega III in Salamanca, Spain, we studied the production of several radioisotopes using the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) method (M. Rodrigues et al. [1], K. Batani et al. [12]). Using the experimental proton energy distribution recorded on a shot-by-shot basis and confirmed on average in a follow-up experiment, we derive the number of nuclear reactions on different targets for a single shot. From this single-shot analysis, we obtain an effective plasma temperature per shot from the yield ratio 11C/7Be. This gives strong limits to the yields of the reaction p + 11B -&gt; 3 alpha, which may reach (1.6 +/- 0.5) x 10^9 as in 2pi. From the fluctuations of the proton spectra and the fusion yields, we derive the TNSA Equation of State (EOS). The deviation of this EOS from the classical ideal gas limit indicates that the plasma is non-neutral and well described by the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Solitons drive the system toward charge neutrality. We derive an effective soliton mass of ms = (26 +/- 1) meV and a soliton speed on the order of vs/c ~ 0.06. Understanding the soliton dynamics is crucial for applications and basic science.</description>

      <title>Surface energy-driven crumpling transition in a thin sheet under compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our common experience, crumpling a sheet requires external compressive force and leads to a random network of folds. However, thin sheets have been theoretically predicted to spontaneously transition from a flat to a crumpled state driven by thermal fluctuations, a phenomenon that has been elusive in experiments. We report the first observation of a similar crumpling transition driven instead by surface energy. Using a sensitive experimental protocol, when we gently compress a thin polymer sheet weakly adhered to a hydrogel substrate it transitions to a self-crumpling state at a well defined critical compression independent of system details. The transition is marked by the percolation of a fold network, and a power law increase in fold density. Most remarkably, the crumpled state shows a tunable order of folds establishing the phenomenon's potential as a simple and scalable technique to do origami with extremely thin sheets.</description>

      <title>Floquet states on disclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that periodic longitudinal modulation of waveguide arrays with disclination can result in the appearance of previously unexplored Floquet modes bound to the disclination core. Such modes arise due to oscillations of the waveguides in the array, periodically switching the structure between topological and trivial phases on each modulation period, so that on average it seems trivial. Localization of such modes depends on the amplitude of waveguide oscillations. Depending on the discrete rotational symmetry of the arrays with disclinations, these modes exhibit distinct spatial profiles unattainable in periodic lattices. Propagation in a medium with focusing cubic nonlinearity reveals that these Floquet states remain localized below a critical power threshold, indicating the possibility of the formation of disclination-bound Floquet solitons. Our results unveil a new regime of localization in photonic systems, bridging disclination topology, Floquet engineering, and nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent condensates: a flexible platform for soliton physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a series of experimental investigations on binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates. Our focus lies on the regime where the interaction parameters place the system at the threshold of miscibility. We demonstrate that the dynamics of such mixtures can be effectively reduced to a single nonlinear equation. This framework is illustrated through the discussion of stable solitonic solutions in one and two dimensions. Furthermore, we show that employing a binary mixture enables exploration beyond the dynamics governed by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, allowing us to address other fundamental equations in nonlinear physics, such as the Landau-Lifshitz equation describing the motion of spin chains in ferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review progress on questions related to front propagation into unstable states and point out open problems in the area. We strive to highlight different theoretical perspectives and challenges while also addressing more practical questions with examples and guides to computational methods. Throughout we take a dynamical systems point of view that focuses on the ability of invasion processes to act as a selection mechanism in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Space-time resonances in the spatiotemporal spectrum of nonlinear dispersive waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In weakly nonlinear dispersive wave systems, long-time dynamics are typically governed by time resonances, where wave phases evolve coherently due to exact frequency matching. Recent advances in spatio-temporal spectrum measurements, however, reveal prominent features that go beyond the predictions of time resonance theory. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to interpret these signatures by identifying and characterizing an alternative mechanism: space resonances. These arise when wave packets share the same group velocity and remain co-located, leading to long-lived interactions. We further show that gauge-breaking terms in the Hamiltonian give rise to space resonances supported on negative frequencies. By combining sea-surface elevation data, numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we derive the leading-order spatio-temporal spectrum for weakly interacting water waves, providing a unified explanation for its observed features.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Variability Alters Macroscopic Rotation Speed in Stochastic Spiral Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general theory for noise-induced corrections to the angular velocity of spiral waves. Stochasticity produces two second-order effects: an instantaneous term from heterogeneity that always slows rotation, and an orbital-drift term from temporal fluctuations that can either accelerate or decelerate it. For our parameters, orbital drift is weaker, producing a net slowdown. Analytical predictions match Barkley-model simulations with temporal noise. Examination of additional noise types in silico confirms angular velocity slowing. This mechanism provides a robust route by which stochasticity reshapes spiral dynamics in excitable media, with direct implications for arrhythmias and neural wave propagation.</description>
