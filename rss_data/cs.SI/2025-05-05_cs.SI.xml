      <title>Drilling into Erasmus learning mobility flows between countries 2014-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing the Erasmus mobility network, we illustrate typical problems and approaches in analyzing weighted networks. We propose alternative exploratory views on the network "Erasmus+ learning mobility flows since 2014". The network has 35 nodes (countries), is very dense, and the range of link weights (number of visits) is huge (from 1 to 217003). An increasing transformation is used to reduce the range. The traditional graph-based visualization is unreadable. To gain insight into the structure of a dense network, it can be reduced to a skeleton by removing less essential links and/or nodes. We have determined the 1-neighbors and 2-neighbors subnetworks. The 1-neighbors skeleton highlights Spain as the main attractor in the network. The 2-neighbors skeleton shows the dominant role of Spain, Germany, France, and Italy. The hubs and authorities, Pathfinder and Ps cores methods confirm these observations.
  Using the "right" order of the nodes in a matrix representation can reveal the network structure as block patterns in the displayed matrix. The clustering of network nodes based on corrected Salton dissimilarity again shows the dominant role of Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, but also two main clusters of the division into developed/less developed countries. The Balassa normalization (log(measured/expected) visits) matrix shows that most visits within the two main clusters are above expected, while most visits between them are below expected; within the clusters of Balkan countries, Baltic countries, {SK, CZ, HU}, {IS, DK, NO} visits are much above expected, etc.</description>

      <title>Towards a format for describing networks / 1. Networks and knowledge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between the concepts of network and knowledge graph is explored. A knowledge graph can be considered a special type of network. When using a knowledge graph, various networks can be obtained from it, and network analysis procedures can be applied to them. RDF is a formalization of the knowledge graph concept for the Semantic Web, but some of its solutions are also extensible to a format for describing general networks.</description>

      <title>Extended Persistent Homology Distinguishes Simple and Complex Contagions with High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The social contagion literature makes a distinction between simple (independent cascade or bond percolation processes that pass infections through edges) and complex contagions (bootstrap percolation or threshold processes that require local reinforcement to spread). However, distinguishing simple and complex contagions using observational data poses a significant challenge in practice. Estimating population-level activation functions from observed contagion dynamics is hindered by confounding factors that influence adoptions (other than neighborhood interactions), as well as heterogeneity in individual behaviors and modeling variations that make it difficult to design appropriate null models for inferring contagion types. Here, we show that a new tool from topological data analysis (TDA), called extended persistent homology (EPH), when applied to contagion processes over networks, can effectively detect simple and complex contagion processes, as well as predict their parameters. We train classification and regression models using EPH-based topological summaries computed on simulated simple and complex contagion dynamics on three real-world network datasets and obtain high predictive performance over a wide range of contagion parameters and under a variety of informational constraints, including uncertainty in model parameters, noise, and partial observability of contagion dynamics. EPH captures the role of cycles of varying lengths in the observed contagion dynamics and offers a useful metric to classify contagion models and predict their parameters. Analyzing geometrical features of network contagion using TDA tools such as EPH can find applications in other network problems such as seeding, vaccination, and quarantine optimization, as well as network inference and reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>Self-moderation in the decentralized era: decoding blocking behavior on Bluesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moderation and blocking behavior, both closely related to the mitigation of abuse and misinformation on social platforms, are fundamental mechanisms for maintaining healthy online communities. However, while centralized platforms typically employ top-down moderation, decentralized networks rely on users to self-regulate through mechanisms like blocking actions to safeguard their online experience. Given the novelty of the decentralized paradigm, addressing self-moderation is critical for understanding how community safety and user autonomy can be effectively balanced. This study examines user blocking on Bluesky, a decentralized social networking platform, providing a comprehensive analysis of over three months of user activity through the lens of blocking behaviour. We define profiles based on 86 features that describe user activity, content characteristics, and network interactions, addressing two primary questions: (1) Is the likelihood of a user being blocked inferable from their online behavior? and (2) What behavioral features are associated with an increased likelihood of being blocked? Our findings offer valuable insights and contribute with a robust analytical framework to advance research in moderation on decentralized social networks.</description>

      <title>Tell me who its founders are and I'll tell you what your online community looks like: Online community founders' personality and community attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communities are an increasingly important stakeholder for firms, and despite the growing body of research on them, much remains to be learned about them and about the factors that determine their attributes and sustainability. Whereas most of the literature focuses on predictors such as community activity, network structure, and platform interface, there is little research about behavioral and psychological aspects of community members and leaders. In the present study we focus on the personality traits of community founders as predictors of community attributes and sustainability. We develop a tool to estimate community members' Big Five personality traits from their social media text and use it to estimate the traits of 35,164 founders in 8,625 Reddit communities. We find support for most of our predictions about the relationships between founder traits and community sustainability and attributes, including the level of engagement within the community, aspects of its social network structure, and whether the founders themselves remain active in it.</description>

      <title>SMSAT: A Multimodal Acoustic Dataset and Deep Contrastive Learning Framework for Affective and Physiological Modeling of Spiritual Meditation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how auditory stimuli influence emotional and physiological states is fundamental to advancing affective computing and mental health technologies. In this paper, we present a multimodal evaluation of the affective and physiological impacts of three auditory conditions, that is, spiritual meditation (SM), music (M), and natural silence (NS), using a comprehensive suite of biometric signal measures. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce the Spiritual, Music, Silence Acoustic Time Series (SMSAT) dataset, a novel benchmark comprising acoustic time series (ATS) signals recorded under controlled exposure protocols, with careful attention to demographic diversity and experimental consistency. To model the auditory induced states, we develop a contrastive learning based SMSAT audio encoder that extracts highly discriminative embeddings from ATS data, achieving 99.99% classification accuracy in interclass and intraclass evaluations. Furthermore, we propose the Calmness Analysis Model (CAM), a deep learning framework integrating 25 handcrafted and learned features for affective state classification across auditory conditions, attaining robust 99.99% classification accuracy. In contrast, pairwise t tests reveal significant deviations in cardiac response characteristics (CRC) between SM analysis via ANOVA inducing more significant physiological fluctuations. Compared to existing state of the art methods reporting accuracies up to 90%, the proposed model demonstrates substantial performance gains (up to 99%). This work contributes a validated multimodal dataset and a scalable deep learning framework for affective computing applications in stress monitoring, mental well-being, and therapeutic audio-based interventions.</description>

      <title>Toward Data-centric Directed Graph Learning: An Entropy-driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directed graph (digraph), as a generalization of undirected graphs, exhibits superior representation capability in modeling complex topology systems and has garnered considerable attention in recent years. Despite the notable efforts made by existing DiGraph Neural Networks (DiGNNs) to leverage directed edges, they still fail to comprehensively delve into the abundant data knowledge concealed in the digraphs. This data-level limitation results in model-level sub-optimal predictive performance and underscores the necessity of further exploring the potential correlations between the directed edges (topology) and node profiles (feature and labels) from a data-centric perspective, thereby empowering model-centric neural networks with stronger encoding capabilities.
  In this paper, we propose \textbf{E}ntropy-driven \textbf{D}igraph knowl\textbf{E}dge distillatio\textbf{N} (EDEN), which can serve as a data-centric digraph learning paradigm or a model-agnostic hot-and-plug data-centric Knowledge Distillation (KD) module. The core idea is to achieve data-centric ML, guided by our proposed hierarchical encoding theory for structured data. Specifically, EDEN first utilizes directed structural measurements from a topology perspective to construct a coarse-grained Hierarchical Knowledge Tree (HKT). Subsequently, EDEN quantifies the mutual information of node profiles to refine knowledge flow in the HKT, enabling data-centric KD supervision within model training. As a general framework, EDEN can also naturally extend to undirected scenarios and demonstrate satisfactory performance. In our experiments, EDEN has been widely evaluated on 14 (di)graph datasets (homophily and heterophily) and across 4 downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that EDEN attains SOTA performance and exhibits strong improvement for prevalent (Di)GNNs.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Conversation-Based Multimodal Abuse Detection Through Text and Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abusive behavior is common on online social networks, and forces the hosts of such platforms to find new solutions to address this problem. Various methods have been proposed to automate this task in the past decade. Most of them rely on the exchanged content, but ignore the structure and dynamics of the conversation, which could provide some relevant information. In this article, we propose to use representation learning methods to automatically produce embeddings of this textual content and of the conversational graphs depicting message exchanges. While the latter could be enhanced by including additional information on top of the raw conversational structure, no method currently exists to learn wholegraph representations using simultaneously edge directions, weights, signs, and vertex attributes. We propose two such methods to fill this gap in the literature. We experiment with 5 textual and 13 graph embedding methods, and apply them to a dataset of online messages annotated for abuse detection. Our best results achieve an F -measure of 81.02 using text alone and 80.61 using graphs alone. We also combine both modalities of information (text and graphs) through three fusion strategies, and show that this strongly improves abuse detection performance, increasing the F -measure to 87.06. Finally, we identify which specific engineered features are captured by the embedding methods under consideration. These features have clear interpretations and help explain what information the representation learning methods deem discriminative.</description>

      <title>Network Sampling: An Overview and Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives.</description>

      <title>Sentiment and Social Signals in the Climate Crisis: A Survey on Analyzing Social Media Responses to Extreme Weather Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme weather events driven by climate change, such as wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, prompt significant public reactions on social media platforms. Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</description>

      <title>Mining and Intervention of Social Networks Information Cocoon Based on Multi-Layer Network Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of information technology and the widespread utilization of recommendation algorithms, users are able to access information more conveniently, while the content they receive tends to be homogeneous. Homogeneous viewpoints and preferences tend to cluster users into sub-networks, leading to group polarization and increasing the likelihood of forming information cocoons. This paper aims to handle information cocoon phenomena in debates on social media. In order to investigate potential user connections, we construct a double-layer network that incorporates two dimensions: relational ties and feature-based similarity between users. Based on the structure of the multi-layer network, we promote two graph auto-encoder (GAE) based community detection algorithms, which can be applied to the partition and determination of information cocoons. This paper tests these two algorithms on Cora, Citeseer, and synthetic datasets, comparing them with existing multi-layer network unsupervised community detection algorithms. Numerical experiments illustrate that the algorithms proposed in this paper significantly improve prediction accuracy indicator NMI (normalized mutual information) and network topology indicator Q. Additionally, an influence-based intervention measure on which algorithms can operate is proposed. Through the Markov states transition model, we simulate the intervention effects, which illustrate that our community detection algorithms play a vital role in partitioning and determining information cocoons. Simultaneously, our intervention strategy alleviates the polarization of viewpoints and the formation of information cocoons with minimal intervention effort.</description>
