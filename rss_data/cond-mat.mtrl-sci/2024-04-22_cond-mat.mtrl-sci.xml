      <title>Investigation of phonons and magnons in [Ni80Fe20/Au/Co/Au]N multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between phonons and magnons is a widely developing topic, especially in the field of acoustic spintronics. To discuss this interaction, it is necessary to observe two different waves (acoustic and spin waves) with the same frequency and wavelength. In the Ni80Fe20/Au/Co/Au system deposited on a silicon substrate, we observe the interaction between spin waves and surface acoustic waves using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. As a result, we can selectively control (activate or deactivate) the magnetoelastic interaction between the fundamental spin wave mode and surface acoustic waves by adjusting the magnetostrictive layer thickness in the multilayer. We demonstrate that by adjusting the number of layers in a multilayer structure, we can precisely control the dispersion of surface acoustic waves, with minimal impact on the fundamental spin wave mode</description>

      <title>Harnessing Large Language Model to collect and analyze Metal-organic framework property dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research was focused on the efficient collection of experimental Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) data from scientific literature to address the challenges of accessing hard-to-find data and improving the quality of information available for machine learning studies in materials science. Utilizing a chain of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), we developed a systematic approach to extract and organize MOF data into a structured format. Our methodology successfully compiled information from more than 40,000 research articles, creating a comprehensive and ready-to-use dataset. The findings highlight the significant advantage of incorporating experimental data over relying solely on simulated data for enhancing the accuracy of machine learning predictions in the field of MOF research.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional graphene-based and amorphous magnetic materials: synthesis, characterization, and applications in electromagnetic shielding and advanced gas sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis thoroughly investigates the production, characterization, and applications of graphene-based materials (GBMs) and amorphous magnetic materials, particularly in electromagnetic shielding and gas sensing. Four main research lines are pursued: GBM production, GBMs and amorphous magnetic materials in shielding applications, GBMs in gas sensors, and amorphous magnetic materials in magnetoelastic resonance-based sensors. Scalable methods for GBM production are explored, including ball milling, yielding few-layered mesoporous graphene (FLMG). FLMG enhances electromagnetic shielding when combined with amorphous magnetic microwires (MW), showing synergistic effects. FLMG also demonstrates effective NO2 detection in gas sensors, with UV irradiation improving sensor performance. Amorphous magnetic materials show promise in magnetoelastic resonance-based sensors for biomedical applications. Overall, this thesis addresses current limitations in electromagnetic shielding and gas detection, supported by patents and scientific publications.</description>

      <title>Particle pinning during grain growth -- A new analytical model for predicting the mean limiting grain size but also grain size heterogeneity in a 2D polycrystalline context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new analytical model for grain boundary pinning by second phase particles in two-dimensional polycrystals. This approach not only considers how particles impede grain growth, but also elucidates their role in preventing grain disappearance, thereby leading to stabilised microstructures characterised by heterogeneous grain size distribution comprising a mixture of small and large grains. By quantifying the number of particles intercepted by grain boundaries during grain growth or shrinkage, we are able to calculate the respective sizes and fractions of large and small grains. Furthermore, we identify ranges of particle surface fractions and particle sizes that maximise the heterogeneity in grain size. Additionally, we demonstrate the significant influence of initial grain size on the limiting grain size in pinned microstructures. Our analytical model's results are compared with those obtained from full-field level-set simulations conducted in this study and from phase-field calculations reported in the literature, revealing very good agreement. Finally, the differences between the proposed model and existing ones in the literature are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sonication-assisted liquid phase exfoliation of two-dimensional CrTe$_3$ under inert conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) has been used for the successful fabrication of nanosheets from a large number of van der Waals materials. While this allows to study fundamental changes of material properties' associated with reduced dimensions, it also changes the chemistry of many materials due to a significant increase of the effective surface area, often accompanied with enhanced reactivity and accelerated oxidation. To prevent material decomposition, LPE and processing in inert atmosphere have been developed, which enables the preparation of pristine nanomaterials, and to systematically study compositional changes over time for different storage conditions. Here, we demonstrate the inert exfoliation of the oxidation-sensitive van der Waals crystal, CrTe$_3$. The pristine nanomaterial was purified and size-selected by centrifugation, nanosheet dimensions in the fractions quantified by atomic force microscopy and studied by Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and photo spectroscopic measurements. We find a dependence of the relative intensities of the CrTe$_3$ Raman modes on the propagation direction of the incident light, which prevents a correlation of the Raman spectral profile to the nanosheet dimensions. XPS and EDX reveal that the contribution of surface oxides to the spectra is reduced after exfoliation compared to the bulk material. Further, the decomposition mechanism of the nanosheets was studied by time-dependent extinction measurements after water titration experiments to initially dry solvents, which suggest that water plays a significant role in the material decomposition.</description>

      <title>Band Structure Engineering in Highly Crystalline Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blending of semiconductors for controlling the energy levels (band structure engineering) is an important technique, in particular, for optoelectronic applications. The underlying physics is the delocalized Bloch states, which average over the potential landscape of the blend. For organic semiconductors, it has been shown that two quite different effects, the dielectric constant and electrostatic interaction between molecules, can be used to tune the energy gap and ionization energy of disordered and weakly crystalline organic semiconductor blends. It is so far not known whether the electronic delocalization in organic crystals with large bandwidths can contribute to the energy structure engineering of the blend in a way similar to that in inorganic semiconductors. Here, we investigate the growth of highly ordered organic thin-film blends with a similar chemical structure and show the effect of band structure engineering by spectroscopic methods. We rationalize the experimental results with comprehensive theoretical simulations, showing that the delocalization is a significant effect. Our work paves the way for engineering the band structure of highly ordered organic semiconductor thin films that can be tailored for the desired optoelectronic device application.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear mechanics of phase-change-induced accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a continuum theory of solidification within the context of finite-strain coupled thermoelasticity. We aim to fill a gap in the existing literature, as the existing studies on solidification typically decouple the thermal problem (the classical Stefan's problem) from the elasticity problem, and often limit themselves to linear elasticity with small strains. Treating solidification as an accretion problem, with the growth velocity correlated with the jump in the heat flux across the boundary, it presents an initial boundary-value problem (IBVP) over a domain whose boundary location is a priori unknown. This IBVP is solved numerically for the specific example of radially inward solidification in a spherical container. Several parametric studies are conducted to compare the numerical results with the rigid cases in the literature and gain insights into the role of elastic deformations in solidification.</description>

      <title>Effect of the atomic structure of complexions on the active disconnection mode during shear-coupled grain boundary motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The migration of grain boundaries leads to grain growth in polycrystals and is one mechanism of grain-boundary-mediated plasticity, especially in nanocrystalline metals. This migration is due to the movement of dislocation-like defects, called disconnections, which couple to externally applied shear stresses. While this has been studied in detail in recent years, the active disconnection mode was typically associated with specific macroscopic grain boundary parameters. We know, however, that varying microscopic degrees of freedom can lead to different atomic structures without changing the macroscopic parameters. These structures can transition into each other and are called complexions. Here, we investigate $[11\overline{1}]$ symmetric tilt boundaries in fcc metals, where two complexions -- dubbed domino and pearl -- were observed before. We compare these two complexions for two different misorientations: In $\Sigma19$b $[11\overline{1}]$ $(178)$ boundaries, both complexions exhibit the same disconnection mode. The critical stress for nucleation and propagation of disconnections is nevertheless different for domino and pearl. At low temperatures, the Peierls-like barrier for disconnection propagation dominates, while at higher temperatures the nucleation is the limiting factor. For $\Sigma$7 $[11\overline{1}]$ $(145)$ boundaries, we observed a larger difference. The domino and pearl complexions migrate in different directions under the same boundary conditions. While both migration directions are possible crystallographically, an analysis of the complexions' structural motifs and the disconnection core structures reveals that the choice of disconnection mode and therefore migration direction is directly due to the atomic structure of the grain boundary.</description>

      <title>Transition-state-theory-based interpretation of Landau double well potential for ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of quasi-static negative capacitance (QSNC) was proposed from an interpretation of the widely accepted Landau model of ferroelectrics. However, many works showed not to support the QSNC theory, making it controversial. In this letter we show the Landau model when used together with transition-state-theory, can connect various models including first-principles, Landau, Preisach and nucleation limited switching while it does not predict the existence of QSNC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensities in high-resolution phase-contrast images from electron microscopes build up discretely in time by detecting single electrons. A wave description of pulse-like coherent-inelastic interaction of an electron with matter is detailed and verified. In perspective, the interaction time of any matter wave compares with the lifetime of a virtual particle of any elemental interaction, suggesting the present concept of coherent-inelastic interactions of matter waves might be generalizable.</description>

      <title>Effects of dynamical dielectric screening on the excitonic spectrum of monolayer semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to solve the dynamical Bethe-Salpeter Equation numerically. The method allows one to investigate the effects of dynamical dielectric screening on the spectral position of excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers. The dynamics accounts for the response of optical phonons in the materials below and on top the monolayer to the electric field lines between the electron and hole of the exciton. The inclusion of this effect unravels the origin of a counterintuitive energy blueshift of the exciton resonance, observed recently in monolayer semiconductors that are supported on ionic crystals with large dielectric constants. A surprising result is that while energy renormalization of a free electron in the conduction band or a free hole in the valence band is controlled by the low-frequency dielectric constant, the bandgap energy introduces a phase between the photoexcited electron and hole, rendering contributions from the high-frequency dielectric constant also important when evaluating self-energies of the exciton components. As a result, bandgap renormalization of the exciton is not the sum of independent contributions from energy shifts of the conduction and valence bands. The theory correctly predicts the energy shifts of exciton resonances in various dielectric environments that embed two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Structure, short-range order, and phase stability of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy: Insights from a perturbative, DFT-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase behaviour of the Al$_x$CrFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Our approach is based on a perturbative analysis of the internal energy of the paramagnetic solid solution as evaluated within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker formulation of density functional theory, using the coherent potential approximation to average over disorder. Via application of a Landau-type linear response theory, we infer preferential chemical orderings directly. In addition, we recover a pairwise form of the alloy internal energy suitable for study via atomistic simulations, which in this work are performed using the nested sampling algorithm, which is well-suited for studying complex potential energy surfaces. When the underlying lattice is fcc, at low concentrations of Al, depending on the value of $x$, we predict either an $\mathrm{L}1_2$ or $\mathrm{D}0_{22}$ ordering emerging below approximately 1000 K. On the other hand, when the underlying lattice is bcc, consistent with experimental observations, we predict $\mathrm{B}2$ ordering temperatures higher than the melting temperature of the alloy, confirming that this ordered phase forms directly from the melt. For both fcc and bcc systems, chemical orderings are dominated by Al moving to one sublattice, Ni and Co the other, while Cr and Fe remain comparatively disordered. On the bcc lattice, our atomistic modelling suggests eventual decomposition into $\mathrm{B}2$ NiAl and Cr-rich phases. These results shed light on the fundamental physical origins of atomic ordering tendencies in these intriguing materials.</description>

      <title>Nematicity of a Magnetic Helix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system that possesses translational symmetry but breaks orientational symmetry is known as a nematic phase. While there are many examples of nematic phases in a wide range of contexts, such as in liquid crystals, complex oxides, and superconductors, of particular interest is the magnetic analogue, where the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom of the electron are intertwined. The difficulty of spin nematics is the unambiguous realization and characterization of the phase. Here we present an entirely new type of magnetic nematic phase, which replaces the basis of individual spins with magnetic helices. The helical basis allows for the direct measurement of the order parameters with soft X-ray scattering and a thorough characterization of the nematic phase and its thermodynamic transitions. We discover two distinct nematic phases with unique spatio-temporal correlation signatures. Using coherent X-ray methods, we find that near the phase boundary between the two nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on the timescale of both seconds and sub-nanoseconds. Additionally, we have determined that the fluctuations occur simultaneously with a reorientation of the magnetic helices, indicating that there is spontaneous symmetry breaking and new degrees of freedom become available. Our results provide a novel framework for characterizing exotic phases and the phenomena presented can be mapped onto a broad class of physical systems.</description>

      <title>Optical spectroscopy of excitons in ReS2 monolayers grown by chemical vapor deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayers of ReS2 were grown by a chemical vapor deposition technique on SiO2/Si substrates and investigated at room temperature by using micro-Raman, micro-photoluminescence (PL) and absorbance spectroscopies. The Raman scattering spectrum exhibits several phonon modes that were confirmed by the computation analysis based on the density functional theory. The ReS2 structural integrity was confirmed by using the XRD and the energy dispersion spectroscopy that was obtained by the scanning electron microscopy. Photoluminescence spectra show excitons related to interband transition in thin monolayer flakes and bulk-like structures. Additionally, a sharp PL line located at 1.2620 eV with a second harmonic peak at 2.5420 eV were observed and explained in terms of interband excitonic transitions originated within the rhenium 5d orbit. An optical absorbance spectrum with an exciton peak around 1.4660 eV was obtained for an assembly of ReS2 flakes grown on silica substrate.</description>

      <title>Giant Rashba-Splitting of One-Dimensional Metallic States in Bi Dimer Lines on InAs(100)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth produces different types of ordered superstructures on the InAs(100) surface, depending on the growth procedure and coverage. The (2x1) phase forms at completion of a Bi monolayer and consists of a uniformly oriented array of parallel lines of Bi dimers. Scanning tunneling and core level spectroscopies demonstrate its metallic character, in contrast with the semiconducting properties expected on the basis of the electron counting principle. The weak electronic coupling among neighboring lines gives rise to quasi one-dimensional Bi-derived bands with open contours at the Fermi level. Spin- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a giant Rashba splitting of these bands, in good agreement with ab-initio electronic structure calculations. The very high density of the dimer lines, the metallic and quasi one-dimensional band dispersion and the Rashba-like spin texture make the Bi/InAs(100)-(2x1) phase an intriguing system, where novel transport regimes can be studied.</description>

      <title>Domain wall migration-mediated ferroelectric switching and Rashba effect tuning in GeTe thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium Telluride (GeTe), identified as a ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor, is a promising candidate for future electronic devices in computing and memory applications. However, its ferroelectric switching on a microscopic scale remains to be understood. Here, we propose that the migration of a domain wall can be the mechanism that mediates the ferroelectric switching. By employing $ab~initio$ methods, such a mechanism is characterized by an energy barrier of $66.8$ meV/nm$^2$, in a suitable range for retention and switchability. In accompanying the domain wall migration, the net Rashba effect is tunable, as it is a result of competition between layers with opposite electric polarization. These results shed light on the ferroelectric switching mechanism in GeTe, paving stones for the design of potential GeTe-based devices.</description>

      <title>Extracting Geometry and Topology of Orange Pericarps for the Design of Bioinspired Energy Absorbing Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a result of evolution, many biological materials have developed irregular structures that lead to outstanding mechanical properties, like high stiffness-to-weight ratios and good energy absorption. To reproduce these properties in synthetic materials, biomimicry typically replicates the irregular natural structure, often leading to fabrication challenges. Here, we present a bioinspired material design method that instead reduces the irregular natural structure to a finite set of building blocks, also known as tiles, and rules to connect them, and then uses these elements as instructions to generate synthetic materials with mechanical properties similar to the biological materials. We demonstrate the method using the pericarp of the orange, a member of the citrus family known for its protective, energy-absorbing capabilities. We generate polymer samples and characterize them under quasi-static and dynamic compression and observe spatially-varying stiffness and good energy absorption, as seen in the biological materials. By quantifying which tiles and connectivity rules locally deform in response to loading, we determine how to spatially control the stiffness and energy absorption.</description>

      <title>Angle-Resolved Magneto-Chiral Anisotropy in a Non-Centrosymmetric Atomic Layer Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality in solid-state materials has sparked significant interest due to potential applications of topologically-protected chiral states in next-generation information technology. The electrical magneto-chiral effect (eMChE), arising from relativistic spin-orbit interactions, shows great promise for developing chiral materials and devices for electronic integration. Here we demonstrate an angle-resolved eMChE in an A-B-C-C type atomic-layer superlattice lacking time and space inversion symmetry. We observe non-superimposable enantiomers of left-handed and right-handed tilted uniaxial magnetic anisotropy as the sample rotates under static fields, with the tilting angle reaching a striking 45 degree. Magnetic force microscopy and atomistic simulations correlate the tilt to the emergence and evolution of chiral spin textures. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction lock effect in competition with Zeeman effect is demonstrated to be responsible for the angle-resolved eMChE. Our findings open up a new horizon for engineering angle-resolved magneto-chiral anisotropy, shedding light on the development of novel angle-resolved sensing or writing techniques in chiral spintronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of layered hybrid organic-inorganic metal-halide perovskites: transition metal, organic cation and perovskite phase effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structural and magnetic properties in layered hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) is key for their design and integration in spin-electronic devices. Here, we have conducted a systematic study on ten compounds to understand the effect of the transition metal (Cu$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$, Co$^{2+}$), organic spacer (alkyl- and aryl-ammonium) and perovskite phase (Ruddlesden-Popper and Dion-Jacobson) on the properties of these materials. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements show that the crystals' structural phase transitions are triggered by the motional freedom of the organic cations as well as by the flexibility of the inorganic metal-halide lattice. In the case of Cu$^{2+}$ HOIPs, an increase of the in-plane anisotropy and a reduction of the octahedra interlayer distance is found to change the behavior of the HOIP from that of a 2D ferromagnet to that of a quasi-3D antiferromagnet. Mn$^{2+}$ HOIPs show inherent antiferromagnetic octahedra intralayer interactions and a phenomenologically rich magnetism, presenting spin-canting, spin-flop transitions and metamagnetism controlled by the crystal anisotropy. Co$^{2+}$ crystals with non-linked tetrahedra show a dominant paramagnetic behavior irrespective of the organic spacer and the perovskite phase. This work demonstrates that the chemical flexibility of HOIPs can be exploited to develop novel layered magnetic materials with tailored magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Obscured Phonon Dynamics from Powder Inelastic Neutron Scattering using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of phonon dynamics is pivotal for understanding material properties, yet it faces challenges due to the irreversible information loss inherent in powder inelastic neutron scattering spectra and the limitations of traditional analysis methods. In this study, we present a machine learning framework designed to reveal obscured phonon dynamics from powder spectra. Using a variational autoencoder, we obtain a disentangled latent representation of spectra and successfully extract force constants for reconstructing phonon dispersions. Notably, our model demonstrates effective applicability to experimental data even when trained exclusively on physics-based simulations. The fine-tuning with experimental spectra further mitigates issues arising from domain shift. Analysis of latent space underscores the model's versatility and generalizability, affirming its suitability for complex system applications. Furthermore, our framework's two-stage design is promising for developing a universal pre-trained feature extractor. This approach has the potential to revolutionize neutron measurements of phonon dynamics, offering researchers a potent tool to decipher intricate spectra and gain valuable insights into the intrinsic physics of materials.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in an Antiferromagnetic Vanadium Trichloride Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroicity allows magnetism to be controlled using electric fields or vice versa, which has gained tremendous interest in both fundamental research and device applications. A reduced dimensionality of multiferroic materials is highly desired for device miniaturization, but the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism at the two-dimensional limit is still debated. Here, we used a NbSe2 substrate to break both the C3 rotational and inversion symmetries in monolayer VCl3 and thus introduced exceptional in-plane ferroelectricity into a two-dimensional magnet. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy directly visualized ferroelectric domains and manipulated their domain boundaries in monolayer VCl3, where coexisting antiferromagnetic order with canted magnetic moments was verified by vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. Our density functional theory calculations highlight the crucial role that highly directional interfacial Cl-Se interactions play in breaking the symmetries and thus in introducing in-plane ferroelectricity, which was further verified by examining an ML-VCl3/graphene sample. Our work demonstrates an approach to manipulate the ferroelectric states in monolayered magnets through van der Waals interfacial interactions.</description>

      <title>Pinch-point spectral singularity from the interference of topological loop states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinch point is a spectral discontinuity found in the neutron diffraction image of spin ice. Similar spectral singularity is commonly observed in a broad range of systems that have a close connection with flat bands. We focus on the electron flat band and its two topologically distinct classes of wavefunction: the compact localized state (CLS), and the non-contractible loop state (NLS). We establish their simple mathematical relationship, showing that different Bloch NLSs can be derived as momentum derivatives of a Bloch CLS, depending on the approaching direction toward the singular point. This CLS-NLS correspondence helps visualize the pinch point as an interference pattern among NLSs through a ``polarizer", which encodes the information about the location of singular momentum and the experimental techniques like spin-polarized photoemission spectroscopy. It helps extract topological information knit to microscopic electronic and magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Photoluminescence by Strain-Engineering in Layered Perovskite Flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain is an effective strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties of 2D materials, but it has been almost unexplored in layered hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) due to their complex band structure and mechanical properties. Here, we investigate the temperature-dependent microphotoluminescence (PL) of 2D $(C_6H_5CH_2CH_2NH_3)_2Cs_3Pb_4Br_{13}$ HOIP subject to biaxial strain induced by a $SiO_2$ ring platform on which flakes are placed by viscoelastic stamping. At 80 K, we found that a strain of &lt;1% can change the PL emission from a single peak (unstrained) to three well-resolved peaks. Supported by micro-Raman spectroscopy, we show that the thermomechanically generated strain modulates the bandgap due to changes in the octahedral tilting and lattice expansion. Mechanical simulations demonstrate the coexistence of tensile and compressive strain along the flake. The observed PL peaks add an interesting feature to the rich phenomenology of photoluminescence in 2D HOIPs, which can be exploited in tailored sensing and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Assessment of Probabilistic Cellular Automata Simulations in Microstructure Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) method is highlighted for its relatively simple numerical algorithm and low computational cost in the simulation of microstructural evolution. In this method, probabilistic state change rules are implemented to compute the evolution of cell states at each time step. The stochastic nature of this simulation method leads to non-repeatable simulation results, introducing inherent uncertainty. In this study, the uncertainty and dispersion in PCA simulations of microstructural evolution were investigated. Hence, the probabilistic transformations of cell states were meticulously considered at each time step, and discrete probability distribution functions (dPDF) were introduced to analyze the frequency distribution of simulation outcomes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed dPDFs, cellular automaton models were developed with various numbers of cells and distribution of transformation probabilities. Multiple iterations of these simulations were conducted, and the validity of the presented distribution functions was assessed through statistical analysis of the simulations outcomes. Comparisons between PCA simulation results and distribution functions demonstrate consistency, emphasizing the predictive capability of the proposed models. Also, the effects of modeling parameters on the uncertainty of simulation results in two and three-dimensional PCA modeling were studied, introducing the coefficient of variation as a measure of dispersion. Results indicate that increasing the number of boundary cells, cellular resolution, and model size reduces uncertainty, enhancing the repeatability of PCA simulation outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A clear understanding of chirality in spin-active electronic states is discussed in order to address confusions about chiral effects recently discovered in materials science. Electronic toroidal monopole $G_0$ can serve as a measure of chirality in this categorization, which can be clearly related to the chiral density operator in the Dirac equation. We extend the concepts of chirality not only to those of materials but also to those of physical fields, and to material-field composites. Additionally, we illustrate specific examples from physics and chemistry that demonstrate the process of acquiring chirality through the combination of seemingly achiral degrees of freedom, which we term the emergence of chirality. Interference among multiple chiralities exhibiting phenomena specific to handedness is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Solute segregation in polycrystalline aluminum from hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with a unified neuroevolution potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most effective methods to enhance the strength of aluminum alloys involves modifying grain boundaries (GBs) through solute segregation. However, the fundamental mechanisms of solute segregation and their impacts on material properties remain elusive. In this study, we implemented highly efficient hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MCMD) algorithms in the graphics process units molecular dynamics (GPUMD) package. Using this efficient MCMD approach combined with a general-purpose machine-learning-based neuroevolution potential (NEP) for 16 elemental metals and their alloys, we simulated the segregation of 15 solutes in polycrystalline Al. Our results elucidate the segregation behavior and trends of 15 solutes in polycrystalline Al. Additionally, we investigated the impact of solutes on the strength of polycrystalline Al. The mechanisms underlying solute strengthening and embrittlement were analyzed at the atomistic level, revealing the importance of GB cohesion, as well as the nucleation and movement of Shockley dislocations, in determining the material's strength. We anticipate that our developed methods, along with our insights into solute segregation behavior in polycrystalline Al, will be valuable for the design of Al alloys and other multi-component materials, including medium-entropy materials, high-entropy materials, and complex concentrated alloys.</description>

Abstract: Information technology and data science development stimulate transformation in many fields of scientific knowledge. In recent years, a large number of specialized systems for information and knowledge management have been created in materials science. However, the development and deployment of open adaptive systems for research support in materials science based on the acquisition, storage, and processing of different types of information remains unsolved. We propose MatInf - an extensible, open-source solution for research digitalisation in materials science based on an adaptive, flexible information management system for heterogeneous data sources. MatInf can be easily adapted to any materials science laboratory and is especially useful for collaborative projects between several labs. As an example, we demonstrate its application in high-throughput experimentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) are hybrid photon-phonon waves which enable strong light-matter interactions and subdiffractional confinement, potentially empowering applications in sensing, nonlinear optics and nanoscale energy manipulation. In this work, we use confocal Raman microscopy to investigate the coupling between bulk phonon modes and localized surface phonon polariton (SPhP) modes in indium phosphide (InP) nanopillars and 4H-silicon carbide (4H-SiC) gratings. The Raman intensity within the nanostructures is described in terms of the SPhP eigenmodes and used to reconstruct the field intensity, providing a method to map SPhP eigenmodes using visible and near-IR light. Our results indicate that, contrary to expectation, all Raman-active bulk phonon modes of InP and 4H-SiC couple to the localized SPhP modes. Further, we confirm that polarizability selection rules form the predominant coupling mechanism between phonons and SPhP modes, with electron-phonon coupling playing a role for certain phonon modes (A1(LO) and E1(TO) in 4H-SiC). These observations provide a method for extending Raman studies of PhP modes to achieve full 3D reconstruction of the PhP eigenmodes and visualize light-matter interactions within nanostructures, thus advancing Raman scattering as a technique for understanding PhP modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic textures give rise to unconventional magnetotransport phenomena such as the topological Hall effect and nonreciprocal electronic transport. While the correspondence between real-space magnetic topology/symmetry and such transport phenomena has been well established, a microscopic understanding based on the spin-dependent band structure in momentum space remains elusive. Here we demonstrate how a chiral magnetic structure in real space introduces an asymmetry in the electronic band structure and triggers a nonreciprocal electronic transport in a centrosymmetric helimagnet {\alpha}-EuP$_3$. The magnetic structure of {\alpha}-EuP$_3$ is highly tunable by a magnetic field and closely coupled to its semi-metallic electronic band structure, enabling a systematic study across chiral and achiral magnetic phases on the correspondence between nonreciprocal transport and electronic band asymmetry. Our findings reveal how a microscopic change in the magnetic configuration of charge carriers can lead to nonreciprocal electronic transport, paving the way for designing chiral magnets with desirable properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, machine-learning approaches have accelerated computational materials design and the search for advanced solid electrolytes. However, the predictors are currently limited to static structural parameters, which may not fully account for the dynamic nature of ionic transport. In this study, we meticulously curated features considering dynamic properties and developed machine-learning models to predict the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes. We compiled 14 phonon-related descriptors from first-principles phonon calculations along with 16 descriptors related to structure and electronic properties. Our logistic regression classifiers exhibit an accuracy of 93 %, while the random forest regression model yields a root mean square error of 1.179 S/cm and $R^2$ of 0.710. Notably, phonon-related features are essential for estimating the ionic conductivity in both models. Furthermore, we applied our prediction model to screen 264 Li-containing materials and identified 11 promising candidates as potential superionic conductors.</description>

Abstract: Similarity between Walker and Helmholtz equations encouraged many to search for analogies between optical and spin wave phenomena. In the present article we demonstrate that one to one relationship can be established by formalizing the concept of magnetic refractive index and deriving on its basis Eikonal equations for magnetic media, formally proving that a very substantial portion of optical devices: lenses, mirrors, waveguides and so on, can be implemented as magnetic devices operating on spin waves instead of optical radiation. Controlling the refractive index is accomplished by changing the environmental variables such as magnetic bias field or temperature. Functionality of the above mentioned devices is confirmed with micromagnetic simulations, which also demonstrate a substantial agreement with the analytical model introduced in the present manuscript.</description>

Abstract: Soil degradation threatens agricultural productivity and food supply, leading to hunger issues in some developing regions. To address this challenge, we developed a low-cost, highly efficient, and long-term stable soil improvement method. We chose polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a commercially available polymer that is safe and non-degradable, to serve as a soil adhesive. We mixed PVA solution into the soil and applied a drying treatment to enhance the bonding between PVA and the soil, achieving highly water-stable soil. This PVA-stabilized soil exhibits low bulk density, high porosity, and high permeability, making it an ideal substrate for planting. In a germination test, the PVA-stabilized soil revealed a higher germination rate and growth rate compared to those of the non-treated soil. We believe this simple and efficient soil improvement method can restore degraded soil and contribute to sustainable agriculture.</description>

      <title>Importance of the semimetallic state for the quantum Hall effect in HfTe$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At ambient pressure, HfTe$_{5}$ is a material at the boundary between a weak and a strong topological phase, which can be tuned by changes in its crystalline structure or by the application of high magnetic fields. It exhibits a Lifshitz transition upon cooling, and three-dimensional (3D) quantum Hall effect (QHE) plateaus can be observed at low temperatures. Here, we have investigated the electrical transport properties of HfTe$_{5}$ under hydrostatic pressure up to 3 GPa. We find a pressure-induced crossover from a semimetallic phase at low pressures to an insulating phase at about 1.5 GPa. Our data suggest the presence of a pressure-induced Lifshitz transition at low temperatures within the insulating phase around 2 GPa. The quasi-3D QHE is confined to the low-pressure region in the semimetallic phase. This reveals the importance of the semimetallic groundstate for the emergence of the QHE in HfTe$_{5}$ and thus favors a scenario based on a low carrier density metal in the quantum limit for the observed signatures of the quasi-quantized 3D QHE.</description>

      <title>A regressor-based hysteresis formulation for the magnetic characterisation of low carbon steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, two different parametric hysteresis models, the Jiles-Atherton model and the Mel'gui relation, have been combined to form a more general hysteresis operator, suitable for the description of families of experimental B(H) curves obtained for low carbon (LC) steel specimens after isothermal annealing at different temperatures and times. As it has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies, characteristic values of steel hysteresis curves can be used as very efficient identifiers for the monitoring of the different metallurgical transformations that take place during the annealing, such as recovery and recrystallisation processes. It is thus important from a practical point to be able to reproduce the experimental curves obtained under different conditions, as precisely as possible, in order to proceed to the samples characterisation. Hybridisation of the two aforementioned models demonstrated satisfactory results for the reproduction of all considered curves obtained under the different considered annealing conditions.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Apparent Electric-Field Dependence of Electrostrictive Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrostrictive materials exhibit a strain that is proportional to the square of the induced polarization. In linear dielectrics where the permittivity is constant, this electromechanical strain is also proportional to the square of the electric field. However, under increasing amplitudes of the driving field, the electromechanical strain sometimes saturates; the electrostrictive coefficients therefore appear to depend on the amplitude of the electric field used to measure them. Here, we present a methodology showing that this apparent field dependence is a consequence of neglecting higher-order electromechanical phenomena. When these are taken into account, not only do the electrostrictive coefficients remain constant but the signs of the high-order coefficients enable the prediction of the saturation behavior from a single measurement. We illustrate this approach on both classical and non-classical (so-called ``giant'') electrostrictors.</description>

      <title>High efficient sunlight-driven CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over NiZn intermetallic catalysts under atmospheric pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of solar methanol through direct CO2 hydrogenation using solar energy is of great importance in advancing a sustainable energy economy. In this study, non-precious NiZn intermetallic/ZnO catalyst is reported to catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol using sunlight irradiation (1sun). The NiZn-ZnO interface is identified as the active site to stabilize the key intermediates of HxCO*. At ambient pressure, the NiZn-ZnO catalyst demonstrates a methanol production rate of 127.5 umol g-1h-1 from solar driven CO2 hydrogenation, with a remarkable 100% selectivity towards methanol in the total organic products. Notably, this production rate stands as the highest record for photothermic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol in continuous-flow reactors with sunlight as the only requisite energy input. This discovery not only paves the way for the development of novel catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol but also marks a significant stride towards a full solar-driven chemical energy storage.</description>

      <title>Simulated structure and thermodynamics of decagonal Al-Co-Cu quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic structures of Al-Co-Cu decagonal quasicrystals (QCs) are investigated using empirical oscillating pair potentials (EOPP) in molecular dynamic (MD) simulations that we enhance by Monte Carlo (MC) swapping of chemical species and replica exchange. Predicted structures exhibit planar decagonal tilin g patterns and are periodic along the perpendicular direction. We then recalculate the energies of promising structures using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), along with energies of competing phases. We find that our $\tau$-inflated sequence of QC approximants are energetically unstable a t low temperature by at least 3 meV/atom. Extending our study to finite temperatures by calculating harmonic vibrational entropy, as well as anharmonic contributions that include chemical species swaps and tile flips, our results suggest that the quasicrystal phase is entropically stabilized at temperatur es in the range 600-800K and above. It decomposes into ordinary (though complex) crystal phases at low temperatures, including a partially disordered B2-type phase. We discuss the influence of density and composition on QC phase stability; we compare the structural differences between Co-rich and Cu-rich quasicrystals; and we analyze the role of entropy in stabilizing the quasicrystal, concluding with a discussion of the possible existence of "high entropy" quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Chemically Stable Group IV-V Transition Metal Carbide Thin Films in Hydrogen Radical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen is playing a crucial role in the green energy transition. Yet, its tendency to react with and diffuse into surrounding materials poses a challenge. Therefore, it is critical to develop coatings that protect hydrogen-sensitive system components in reactive-hydrogen environments. In this work, we report group IV-V transition metal carbide (TMC) thin films as potential candidates for hydrogen-protective coatings in hydrogen radical (H*) environments at elevated temperatures. We identify three classes of TMCs based on the reduction of carbides and surface oxides (TMOx). HfC, ZrC, TiC, TaC, NbC, and VC (class A) are found to have a stable carbidic-C (TM-C) content, with a further sub-division into partial (class A1: HfC, ZrC, and TiC) and strong (class A2: TaC, NbC, and VC) surface TMOx reduction. In contrast to class A, a strong carbide reduction is observed in Co2C (class B), along with a strong surface TMOx reduction. The H*-TMC/TMOx interaction is hypothesized to entail three processes: (i) hydrogenation of surface C/O-atoms, (ii) formation of CHx/OHx species, and (iii) subsurface C/O-atoms diffusion to the surface vacancies. The number of adsorbed H-atoms required to form CHx/OHx species (i), and the corresponding energy barriers (ii) are estimated based on the change in the Gibbs free energy (DeltaG) for the reduction reactions of TMCs and TMOx. Hydrogenation of surface carbidic-C-atoms is proposed to limit the reduction of TMCs, whereas the reduction of surface TMOx is governed by the thermodynamic barrier for forming H2O.</description>

      <title>Physics-based reward driven image analysis in microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of electron microscopy has expanded our ability to acquire nanometer and atomically resolved images of complex materials. The resulting vast datasets are typically analyzed by human operators, an intrinsically challenging process due to the multiple possible analysis steps and the corresponding need to build and optimize complex analysis workflows. We present a methodology based on the concept of a Reward Function coupled with Bayesian Optimization, to optimize image analysis workflows dynamically. The Reward Function is engineered to closely align with the experimental objectives and broader context and is quantifiable upon completion of the analysis. Here, cross-section, high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images of ion-irradiated (Y, \text{Dy})\text{Ba}_2\text{Cu}_3\text{O}_{7-\delta} thin-films were used as a model system. The reward functions were formed based on the expected materials density and atomic spacings and used to drive multi-objective optimization of the classical Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) method. These results can be benchmarked against the DCNN segmentation. This optimized LoG* compares favorably against DCNN in the presence of the additional noise. We further extend the reward function approach towards the identification of partially-disordered regions, creating a physics-driven reward function and action space of high-dimensional clustering. We pose that with correct definition, the reward function approach allows real-time optimization of complex analysis workflows at much higher speeds and lower computational costs than classical DCNN-based inference, ensuring the attainment of results that are both precise and aligned with the human-defined objectives.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent photodynamics of boron-vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively-charged boron vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is currently garnering considerable attention for the design of two-dimensional (2D) quantum sensing units. Such developments require a precise understanding of the spin-dependent optical response of V$_\text{B}^-$ centers, which still remains poorly documented despite its key role for sensing applications. Here we investigate the spin-dependent photodynamics of V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in hBN by a series of time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements. We first introduce a robust all-optical method to infer the spin-dependent lifetime of the excited states and the electron spin polarization of V$_\text{B}^-$ centers under optical pumping. Using these results, we then analyze PL time traces recorded at different optical excitation powers with a seven-level model of the V$_\text{B}^-$ center and we extract all the rates involved in the spin-dependent optical cycles, both under ambient conditions and at liquid helium temperature. These findings are finally used to study the impact of a vector magnetic field on the optical response. More precisely, we analyze PL quenching effects resulting from electron spin mixing induced by the magnetic field component perpendicular to the V$_\text{B}^-$ quantization axis. All experimental results are well reproduced by the seven-level model, illustrating its robustness to describe the spin-dependent photodymanics of V$_\text{B}^-$ centers. This work provides important insights into the properties of V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in hBN, which are valuable for future developments of 2D quantum sensing units.</description>

      <title>Edge-selective reconfiguration in polarized lattices with magnet-enabled bistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature topological feature of Maxwell lattices is their polarization, which manifests as an unbalance in stiffness between opposite edges of a finite domain. The manifestation of this asymmetry is especially dramatic in the case of soft lattices undergoing large nonlinear deformation under concentrated loads, where the excess of softness at the soft edge can result in the activation of sharp indentations. This study explores how this mechanical dichotomy between edges can be tuned and possibly extremized by working with soft magneto-mechanical metamaterials. The magneto-mechanical coupling is obtained by endowing the lattice sites with permanent magnets, which activate a network of magnetic forces that can interact with (either augmenting or competing with) the elasticity of the material. Specifically, under sufficiently large deformation that macroscopically alters the equilibrium positions of the sites, the attractive forces between the magnets can trigger bistable reconfiguration mechanisms. The strength of such mechanisms depends on the landscapes of elastic reaction forces exhibited by the edges, which are different due to the polarization, and is therefore inherently edge-selective. We show that, on the soft edge, the addition of magnets simply enhances the softness of the edge. In contrast, on the stiff edge, the magnets activate snapping mechanisms that locally reconfigure the cells and produce a lattice response reminiscent of plasticity, characterized by residual deformation that persists upon unloading.</description>

Abstract: Efficient heuristics have predicted many functional materials such as high-temperature superconducting hydrides, while inorganic structural chemistry explains why and how the crystal structures are stabilized. Here we develop the paired mathematical programming formalism for searching and systematizing the structural prototypes of crystals. The first is the minimization of the volume of the unit cell under the constraints of only the minimum and maximum distances between pairs of atoms. We show the capabilities of linear relaxations of inequality constraints to optimize structures by the steepest-descent method, which is computationally very efficient. The second is the discrete optimization to assign five kinds of geometrical constraints including chemical bonds for pairs of atoms. Under the constraints, the two object functions, formulated as mathematical programming, are alternately optimized to realize the given coordination numbers of atoms. This approach successfully generates a wide variety of crystal structures of oxides such as spinel, pyrochlore-$\alpha$, and $\mathrm{K}_2 \mathrm{NiF}_4$ structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyes used in industries such as textile, paper, and leather are known to be harmful to both human health and aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, finding effective and sustainable methods to remove dyes from wastewater is crucial for mitigating the detrimental effects of pollution.TiN nanoparticles have good absorption and conversion of light energy into thermal energy in the visible range of the spectrum, which makes them promising in various applications, from biomedical to environmental protection. In this work, it is shown that titanium nitride nanoparticles also possess promising adsorption capabilitieseffect. TiN nanoparticles were synthesized by laser ablation method in liquid. Water, acetone and acetonitrile are used as solvent. Nanoparticles were characterized by scanning and transmission microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, which showed the formation of the under-stoichiometric titanium nitride (TiN1-x). TiN nanoparticles are investigated as a promising object for high adsorption It is shown that adsorption of TiN nanoparticles is associated with the electrostatic effect and the presence of pores in the synthesized nanoparticles. Optimal dye absorption capabilities were found to be associated with a low amount of Ti vacancies and high amount of N vacancies acting as donor states. The particles synthesized in water have the highest sorption capacity of dye achieving the value of 136.5 mg/g.</description>

      <title>Comparison of h-BN and graphene layers as grain boundary materials for granular FePt-$\text{L}1_0$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular $\text{L}1_0$-FePt thin films with small columnar grains are essential for heat-assisted magnetic recording media. While hexagonal boron nitride(h-BN) has proven effective for promoting columnar FePt grains, we explored multilayer graphene as an alternative grain boundary material leveraging its structural similarity to h-BN. The FePt granular thin films with carbon-based grain boundary materials(GBMs) were deposited by cosputtering on Si/SiO2 substrates with substrate bias at 650{\deg}C. The RF bias and high temperature facilitated formation of interlinked graphene nanoribbons wrapping around FePt grains, yielding 7.5 nm diameter, 8 nm height grains with an order parameter of 0.78 and a perpendicular coercivity of 40 kOe. However, the formation of graphene nanoribbons could not effectively promote columnar structures, likely due to co-existing amorphous carbon in grain boundaries. Optimizing deposition to improve graphene grain boundary quality is necessary to realize this 2D material's potential for achieving desirable microstructures for HAMR media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallization of rubrene, progressing from an amorphous phase to a triclinic meta-stable and ultimately to the orthorhombic stable phase, offers broad applications not only in organic electronic devices but also for in-depth studies of optical and electronic properties, including exciton distribution and dynamics. We investigate the crystallization of rubrene on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), aiming at the growth of the preferred rubrene orthorhombic phase, which has been reported to have one of the highest charge mobilities in organic semiconductors. This is achieved through controlled heating and enhanced partial pressure. Through precise control of the initial deposition on the substrate, we investigate the growth habit of rubrene crystals by high-rate heat treatment beyond the second crystallization temperature. Furthermore, this work addresses thermal stability and photodegradation across various morphologies.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical detection of spin-orbit torque vector with first-order Kerr effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a novel, compact and cost-effective magneto-optical method for quantifying the spin-orbit torque (SOT) effective field vector (hSO) in magnetic thin films subjected to spin current injection. The damping-like (hSODL) component of the vector is obtained by the polar Kerr response arising from the out-of-plane magnetization tilting, whereas the field-like component (hSODL) is obtained by current-induced hysteresis-loop shifting study, using conventional longitudinal Kerr magnetometry.
  We tested our method in FM/NM bilayers comprising NiFe, CoFeB (ferromagnetic layers) and Pt, Pd, Ta (non-magnetic layers). Our findings revealed a damping-like SOT efficiency xiDL of 0.089 pm 0.006,0.019 pm 0.002, and -0.132 pm 0.009 for Pt, Pd, and Ta, respectively. The hSOFL/hSODL ratio was 0.35 pm 0.02 for NiFe/Pt and 0.14 pm 0.002 for Ta/CoFeB bilayers when the ferromagnetic layer thickness is 4nm.
  A key advancement over the state-of-art magneto-optical methods is the use of an oblique light incidence angle, which allows switching between measuring modes for hSODL and hSOFL, without altering the experimental setup. Moreover, our approach relies exclusively on first-order Kerr effects, thereby ensuring its broad applicability to any type of ferromagnetic material.</description>

      <title>Operando Analysis of Adsorption-Limited Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at Palladium Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palladium (Pd) catalysts have been extensively studied for the direct synthesis of H2O through the hydrogen oxidation reaction at ambient conditions. This heterogeneous catalytic reaction not only holds considerable practical significance but also serves as a classical model for investigating fundamental mechanisms, including adsorption and reactions between adsorbates. Nonetheless, the governing mechanisms and kinetics of its intermediate reaction stages under varying gas conditions remains elusive. This is attributed to the intricate interplay between adsorption, atomic diffusion, and concurrent phase transformation of catalyst. Herein, the Pd-catalyzed, water-forming hydrogen oxidation is studied, in situ, to investigate intermediate reaction stages via fluid cell transmission electron microscopy. The dynamic behaviors of water generation, associated with reversible palladium hydride formation, are captured in real time with a nanoscale spatial resolution. Our findings suggest that the hydrogen oxidation rate catalyzed by Pd is significantly affected by the sequence in which gases are introduced. Through direct evidence of electron diffraction and density functional theory calculation, we demonstrate that the hydrogen oxidation rate is limited by adsorption processes of gas precursors. These nanoscale insights help identify the optimal reaction conditions for Pd-catalyzed hydrogen oxidation, which has substantial implications for water production technologies. The developed understanding also advocates a broader exploration of analogous mechanisms in other metal-catalyzed reactions.</description>

      <title>A Genetic Algorithm For Convex Hull Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computationally efficient and automated generation of convex hulls is desirable for high throughput materials discovery of thermodynamically stable multi-species crystal structures. A convex hull genetic algorithm is proposed that uses methodology adapted from multi-objective optimisation techniques to optimise the convex hull itself as an object, enabling efficient discovery of convex hulls for N &gt;= 2 species. This method, when tested on a LiSi system utilising pre-trained machine learned potentials, was found to be able to efficiently discover reported structures as well as new potential LiSi candidate structures.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence Mapping over Laser Pulse Fluence and Repetition Rate as a Fingerprint of Charge and Defect Dynamics in Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects in metal halide perovskites (MHP) are photosensitive, making the observer effect unavoidable when laser spectroscopy methods are applied. Photoluminescence (PL) bleaching and enhancement under light soaking and recovery in dark are examples of the transient phenomena that are consequent to the creation and healing of defects. Depending on the initial sample composition, environment, and other factors, the defect nature and evolution can strongly vary, making spectroscopic data analysis prone to misinterpretations. Herein, the use of an automatically acquired dependence of PL quantum yield (PLQY) on the laser pulse repetition rate and pulse fluence as a unique fingerprint of both charge carrier dynamics and defect evolution is demonstrated. A simple visual comparison of such fingerprints allows for assessment of similarities and differences between MHP samples. The study illustrates this by examining methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) films with altered stoichiometry that just after preparation showed very pronounced defect dynamics at time scale from milliseconds to seconds, clearly distorting the PLQY fingerprint. Upon weeks of storage, the sample fingerprints evolve toward the standard stoichiometric MAPbI3 in terms of both charge carrier dynamics and defect stability. Automatic PLQY mapping can be used as a universal method for assessment of perovskite sample quality.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency perovskite-organic blend light-emitting diodes featuring self-assembled monolayers as hole-injecting interlayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high photoluminescence efficiency, color purity, extended gamut, and solution processability make low-dimensional hybrid perovskites attractive for light-emitting diode (PeLED) applications. However, controlling the microstructure of these materials to improve the device performance remains challenging. Here, the development of highly efficient green PeLEDs based on blends of the quasi-2D (q2D) perovskite, PEA2Cs4Pb5Br16, and the wide bandgap organic semiconductor 2,7 dioctyl[1] benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) is reported. The presence of C8-BTBT enables the formation of single-crystal-like q2D PEA2Cs4Pb5Br16 domains that are uniform and highly luminescent. Combining the PEA2Cs4Pb5Br16:C8-BTBT with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole-injecting layers (HILs), yields green PeLEDs with greatly enhanced performance characteristics, including external quantum efficiency up to 18.6%, current efficiency up to 46.3 cd/A, the luminance of 45 276 cd m^-2, and improved operational stability compared to neat PeLEDs. The enhanced performance originates from multiple synergistic effects, including enhanced hole-injection enabled by the SAM HILs, the single crystal-like quality of the perovskite phase, and the reduced concentration of electronic defects. This work highlights perovskite:organic blends as promising systems for use in LEDs, while the use of SAM HILs creates new opportunities toward simpler and more stable PeLEDs.</description>

      <title>A universal material model subroutine for soft matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft materials play an integral part in many aspects of modern life including autonomy, sustainability, and human health, and their accurate modeling is critical to understand their unique properties and functions. Today's finite element analysis packages come with a set of pre-programmed material models, which may exhibit restricted validity in capturing the intricate mechanical behavior of these materials. Regrettably, incorporating a modified or novel material model in a finite element analysis package requires non-trivial in-depth knowledge of tensor algebra, continuum mechanics, and computer programming, making it a complex task that is prone to human error. Here we design a universal material subroutine, which automates the integration of novel constitutive models of varying complexity in non-linear finite element packages, with no additional analytical derivations and algorithmic implementations. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach to seamlessly integrate innovative constituent models from the material point to the structural level through a variety of soft matter case studies: a frontal impact to the brain; reconstructive surgery of the scalp; diastolic loading of arteries and the human heart; and the dynamic closing of the tricuspid valve. Our universal material subroutine empowers all users, not solely experts, to conduct reliable engineering analysis of soft matter systems. We envision that this framework will become an indispensable instrument for continued innovation and discovery within the soft matter community at large.</description>

      <title>Effect of disorder on Berry curvature and quantum metric in two-band gapped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric properties of parameter space are mostly described by Berry curvature and quantum metric, which is the imaginary and real part of quantum geometric tensor, respectively. In this work, we calculate the dressed Berry curvature and quantum metric containing eight Feynman diagrams, which is proportional to the leading-order of the concentration of impurities. For a two-band gapped graphene model, we find the disorder does not break the original symmetry of Berry curvature and quantum metric but decrease (increase) the absolute value of conductor (valence) band. We show how impurities affect the Berry curvature and quantum metric, laying the foundation for the study of the influence of impurities on the electron transport properties.</description>

      <title>3D characterization of kinematic fields and poroelastic swelling near the tip of a propagating crack in a hydrogel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fracture mechanics, polyacrylamide hydrogels have been widely used as a model material for experiments, benefited from its optical transparency, fracture brittleness, and low Rayleigh wave velocity. To describe the brittle fracture in the hydrogels, linear elastic fracture mechanics comes as the first choice. However, in soft materials such as hydrogels, the crack opening can be extremely large, leading to substantial geometric nonlinearity and material nonlinearity at the crack tip. Furthermore, poroelasticity may also modify the local mechanical state within the polymer network. Direct characterization of the kinematic fields and poroelastic effect at the crack tip is lacking. Here, based on a hybrid method of digital image correlation and particle tracking technique, we retrieved high-resolution 3D particle trajectories near the tip of a slowly propagating crack and measured the near-tip 3D kinematic fields, including the displacement fields, rotation fields, stretch fields, and swelling fields. Results confirmed the complex multi-axial stretching near the crack tip and the substantial geometric nonlinearity, particularly on the two wakes of the crack where rotation exceeds 30$^{\deg}$. Significant swelling, due to the poroelastic solvent migration, is also observed, with a strong correlation to the local stretch. Our experimental method, without any assumption of the material properties, can be readily extended to study 3D crack tips in a huge varieties of materials, and our results can shed light on the fundamental fracture mechanics and the development of material models for soft materials undergoing large multi-axial loading and substantial swelling.</description>

      <title>Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization by cooperation of planar Hall and orbital Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated through the conventional spin Hall effect and/or Rashba-Edelstein effect are promising for manipulating magnetization. However, this approach typically exhibits non-deterministic and inefficient behaviour when it comes to switching perpendicular ferromagnets. This limitation posed a challenge for write-in operations in high-density magnetic memory devices. Here, we determine an effective solution to overcome this challenge by simultaneously leveraging both a planar Hall effect (PHE) and an orbital Hall effect (OHE). Using a representative Co/PtGd/Mo trilayer SOT device, we demonstrate that the PHE of Co is enhanced by the interfacial coupling of Co/PtGd, giving rise to a finite out-of-plane damping-like torque within the Co layer. Simultaneously, the OHE in Mo layer induces a strong out-of-plane orbital current, significantly amplifying the in-plane damping-like torque through orbital-to-spin conversion. While either the PHE or OHE alone proves insufficient for reversing the perpendicular magnetization of Co, their collaborative action enables high-efficiency field-free deterministic switching. Our work provides a straightforward strategy to realize high-speed and low-power spintronics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spin torque in the topological phase of the 3Q antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration. We first obtain the band structure to identify the topology and nature of the different gaps of the system and then calculate the spin density in the whole system. We demonstrate the presence of a non-vanishing spin-torque component at the edge of the system and analyze its effect on the texture. Moreover, we show that the direction of the torque depends hugely on the way we cut the system to define the edge.</description>

      <title>A Griffith description of fracture for non-monotonic loading with application to fatigue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the fundamental objective of establishing the universality of the Griffith energy competition to describe the growth of large cracks in solids \emph{not} just under monotonic but under general loading conditions, this paper puts forth a generalization of the classical Griffith energy competition in nominally elastic brittle materials to arbitrary \emph{non-monotonic} quasistatic loading conditions, which include monotonic and cyclic loadings as special cases. Centered around experimental observations, the idea consists in: $i$) viewing the critical energy release rate $\mathcal{G}_c$ \emph{not} as a material constant but rather as a material function of both space $\textbf{X}$ and time $t$, $ii$) one that decreases in value as the loading progresses, this solely within a small region $\Omega_\ell(t)$ around crack fronts, with the characteristic size $\ell$ of such a region being material specific, and $iii$) with the decrease in value of $\mathcal{G}_c$ being dependent on the history of the elastic fields in $\Omega_\ell(t)$. By construction, the proposed Griffith formulation is able to describe any Paris-law behavior of the growth of large cracks in nominally elastic brittle materials for the limiting case when the loading is cyclic. For the opposite limiting case when the loading is monotonic, the formulation reduces to the classical Griffith formulation. Additional properties of the proposed formulation are illustrated via a parametric analysis and direct comparisons with representative fatigue fracture experiments on a ceramic, mortar, and PMMA.</description>

Abstract: A home-built compact system that functions as both a transfer stage for deterministic transfer processes and a mask aligner for contact photolithography, is constructed. The precision translation and rotation sample stage and optical microscope are shared between the two modes. In the transfer mode, equipped with a heating element, the setup has been used to deterministically transfer freestanding semiconductors, 2D materials, and van der Waals electrodes. Moreover, with an upgrade cost of less than $1000, an existing transfer stage can be configured into a contact mask aligner. Photolithography patterns with feature sizes of ~1-2 um have been achieved when combining a chromium photomask and a thin photoresist layer, comparable to the performance of an entry level mask aligner such as MJB3 (Karl Suss). Our prototype instrument provides an exciting and affordable solution for preforming high quality deterministic transfer and photolithography processes on one single tool in house.</description>

      <title>Switchable quantized signal between longitudinal conductance and Hall conductance in dual quantum spin Hall insulator TaIrTe$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulating states in two-dimensional (2D) materials are ideal systems to study different types of quantized response signals due to their in gap metallic states. Very recently, the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect was discovered in monolayer $\text{TaIrTe}_4$ via the observation of quantized longitudinal conductance that rarely exists in other 2D topological insulators. The non-trivial $Z_2$ topological charges can exist at both charge neutrality point and the van Hove singularity point with correlation effect induced band gap. Based on this model 2D material, we studied the switch of quantized signals between longitudinal conductance and transversal Hall conductance via tuning external magnetic field. In $Z_2$ topological phase of monolayer $\text{TaIrTe}_4$, the zero Chern number can be understood as 1-1=0 from the double band inversion from spin-up and spin-down channels. After applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane, the Zeeman split changes the band order for one branch of the band inversion from spin-up and spin-down channels, along with a sign charge of the Berry phase. Then the net Chern number of 1-1=0 is tuned to 1+1=2 or -1-1=-2 depending on the orientation of the magnetic field. The quantized signal not only provides another effective method for the verification of topological state in monolayer $\text{TaIrTe}_4$, but also offers a strategy for the utilization of the new quantum topological states based on switchable quantized responses.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of strong relativistic spin-orbit effects in low-dimensional systems provides a rich opportunity for exploring unconventional states of matter. Here, we present a route to realize highly tunable relativistic band structures based on the lateral patterning of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The concept is illustrated on a 1D patterned graphene heterostructure, where the periodic spatial modulation of SOC is shown to give rise to a rich mini-band structure with massless and massive Dirac bands carrying large Berry curvature. The envisaged systems support robust spin Hall responses driven by the quantum geometry of mini-bands, which can be tailored through metasurface fabrication methods and twisting effects. These findings suggest new pathways to 2D quantum material design and low-power spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M\"ossbauer spectroscopy is a technique employed to investigate the microscopic properties of materials using transitions between energy levels in the nuclei. Conventionally, in synchrotron-radiation-based M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, the measurement window is decided by the researcher heuristically, although this decision has a significant impact on the shape of the measurement spectra. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the precision of the spectral position by introducing Bayesian estimation. The proposed method makes it possible to select the best measurement window by calculating the precision of M\"ossbauer spectroscopy from the data. Based on the results, the precision of the M\"ossbauer center shifts improved by more than three times compared with the results achieved with the conventional simple fitting method using the Lorentzian function.</description>

Abstract: We develop an accurate nanoelectronic modeling approach for realistic three-dimensional topological insulator nanostructures and investigate their low-energy surface-state spectrum. Starting from the commonly considered four-band $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{k\cdot p}}$ bulk model Hamiltonian for the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family of topological insulators, we derive new parameter sets for Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$. We consider a fitting strategy applied to \emph{ab initio} band structures around the $\Gamma$ point that ensures a quantitatively accurate description of the low-energy bulk and surface states, while avoiding the appearance of unphysical low-energy states at higher momenta, something that is not guaranteed by the commonly considered perturbative approach. We analyze the effects that arise in the low-energy spectrum of topological surface states due to band anisotropy and electron-hole asymmetry, yielding Dirac surface states that naturally localize on different side facets. In the thin-film limit, when surface states hybridize through the bulk, we resort to a thin-film model and derive thickness-dependent model parameters from \emph{ab initio} calculations that show good agreement with experimentally resolved band structures, unlike the bulk model that neglects relevant many-body effects in this regime. Our versatile modeling approach offers a reliable starting point for accurate simulations of realistic topological material-based nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the optimization of metal recycling with a focus on real-time differentiation between alloys of copper and aluminium. Spectral data, obtained through Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA), is utilized for classification. The study compares data from two detectors, cerium bromide (CeBr$_{3}$) and high purity germanium (HPGe), considering their energy resolution and sensitivity. We test various data generation, preprocessing, and classification methods, with Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) yielding the best results. The study also highlights the impact of different detector types on classification accuracy, with CeBr$_{3}$ excelling in short measurement times and HPGe performing better in longer durations. The findings suggest the importance of selecting the appropriate detector and methodology based on specific application requirements.</description>

      <title>Robust electrothermal switching of optical phase change materials through computer-aided adaptive pulse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrically tunable optical devices present diverse functionalities for manipulating electromagnetic waves by leveraging elements capable of reversibly switching between different optical states. This adaptability in adjusting their responses to electromagnetic waves after fabrication is crucial for developing more efficient and compact optical systems for a broad range of applications including sensing, imaging, telecommunications, and data storage. Chalcogenide-based phase change materials (PCMs) have shown great promise due to their stable, non-volatile phase transition between amorphous and crystalline states. Nonetheless, optimizing the switching parameters of PCM devices and maintaining their stable operation over thousands of cycles with minimal variation can be challenging. In this paper, we report on the critical role of PCM pattern as well as electrical pulse form in achieving reliable and stable switching, extending the operational lifetime of the device beyond 13,000 switching events. To achieve this, we have developed a computer-aided algorithm that monitors optical changes in the device and adjusts the applied voltage in accordance with the phase transformation process, thereby significantly enhancing the lifetime of these reconfigurable devices. Our findings reveal that patterned PCM structures show significantly higher endurance compared to blanket PCM thin films.</description>

      <title>Multi-mem behavior at reduced voltages in La$_{1/2}$Sr$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$Co$_{1/2}$O$_{3-x}$ perovskite modified with Sm:CeO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to mimic the architecture and the information processing mechanisms of the mammalian brain, appearing as the only avenue that offers significant energy savings compared to the standard digital computers. Memcapacitive devices (which can change their capacitance between different non-volatile states upon the application of electrical stimulation) can significantly reduce the energy consumption of bioinspired circuitry. In the present work, we study the multimem (memristive and memcapacitive) behavior of devices based on thin films of the topotactic redox La$_{1/2}$Sr$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$Co$_{1/2}$O$_{3-x}$ (LSMCO) perovskite modified with Sm:Ce$O_2$ (SCO), grown on Nb:SrTiO$_{3}$ with (001) and (110) out of plane orientations. Either the self assembling at the nanoscale of both LSMCO and SCO phases or the doping with Ce(Sm) of the LSMCO perovskite were observed for different fabrication conditions and out of plane orientations. The impact of these changes on the device electrical behavior was determined. The optimum devices resulted those with (110) orientation and Ce(Sm) doping the perovskite. These devices displayed a multimem behavior with robust memcapacitance and significantly lower operation voltages (especially the RESET voltage) in comparison with devices based on pristine LSMCO. In addition, they were able to endure electrical cycling (and the concomitant perovskite topotactic redox transition between oxidized and reduced phases) without suffering nanostructural or chemical changes. We link these properties to an enhanced perovskite reducibility upon Ce(Sm) doping. Our work contributes to increase the reliability of LSMCO based multimem systems and to reduce their operating voltages closer to the 1 V threshold, which are key issues for the development of nanodevices for neuromorphic or in memory computing.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast low-energy photoelectron diffraction for the study of surface-adsorbate interactions with 100 femtosecond temporal resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ultrafast photoemission-based low-energy electron diffraction experiment with monolayer surface sensitivity is presented. In a first experiment on tin-phthalocyanine adsorbed on graphite, we demonstrate a time resolution of approx. 100 fs. Analysis of the transient photoelectron diffraction signal indicates a heating of the adsorbate layer on a time scale of a few ps, suggesting coupling to phononic degrees of freedom of the substrate as the primary energy transfer channel for the vibrational excitation of the adsorbate layer. Remarkably, the transient photoelectron diffraction signal not only provides direct information about the structural dynamics of the adsorbate, but also about the charge carrier dynamics of the substrate. The presented concept combined with momentum microscopy could become a versatile tool for the comprehensive investigation of the coupled charge and vibrational dynamics of relevance for ultrafast surface processes.</description>

      <title>Multipole magnons in topological skyrmion lattices resolved by cryogenic Brillouin light scattering microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-collinear magnetic skyrmion lattices provide novel magnonic functionalities due to their topological magnon bands and asymmetric dispersion relations. Magnon excitations with intermediate wavelengths comparable to inter-skyrmion distances are particularly interesting but largely unexplored so far due to experimental challenges. Here, we report the detection of such magnons with wavevectors q $\simeq$ 48 rad/um in the metastable skyrmion lattice phase of the bulk chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering microscopy. Thanks to its high sensitivity and broad bandwidth we resolved various excitation modes of a single skyrmion lattice domain over a wide magnetic field regime. Besides the known modes with dipole character, quantitative comparison of frequencies and spectral weights to theoretical predictions enabled the identification of a quadrupole mode and observation of signatures which we attribute to a decupole and a sextupole mode. Our combined experimental and theoretical work highlights that skyrmionic phases allow for the design of magnonic devices exploiting topological magnon bands.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kondo lattice model of multipolar magnetic moments interacting with conduction electrons on a triangular lattice. Bond-dependent electron hoppings induce a compass-like anisotropy in the effective Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between multipolar moments. This unique anisotropy stabilizes multipolar skyrmion crystals with a skyrmion topological charge of 1 and 2 at a zero magnetic field. Diverse multipolar phases in the phase diagram give rise to novel spontaneous Hall response of conduction electrons.</description>

      <title>Morphology of buried interfaces in ion-assisted magnetron sputter deposited 11B4C-containing Ni/Ti multilayer neutron optics investigated by grazing incidence small angle scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayer neutron optics require precise control of interface morphology for optimal performance. In this work, we investigate the effects of different growth conditions on the interface morphology of Ni/Ti based multilayers, with a focus on incorporating low-neutron-absorbing 11B4C and using different ion assistance schemes. Grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering was used to probe the structural and morphological details of buried interfaces, revealing that the layers become more strongly correlated and the interfaces form mounds with increasing amounts of 11B4C. Applying high flux ion assistance during growth can reduce mound formation but lead to interface mixing, while a high flux modulated ion assistance scheme with an initial buffer layer grown at low ion energy and the top layer at higher ion energy prevents intermixing. The optimal condition was found to be adding 26.0 at.% 11B4C combined with high flux modulated ion assistance. A multilayer with a period of 48.2 {\AA} and 100 periods was grown under these conditions, and coupled fitting to neutron and X-ray reflectivity data revealed an average interface width of only 2.7 {\AA}, a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art commercial Ni/Ti multilayers. Overall, our study demonstrates that the addition of 11B4C and the use of high flux modulated ion assistance during growth can significantly improve the interface morphology of Ni/Ti multilayers, leading to improved neutron optics performance.</description>

      <title>Perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination -- how far is the radiative limit?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we report an experimental demonstration of perovskite solar cells dominated by bimolecular recombination and critically analyse their performance against radiative limits. To this end, we first establish a set of quantitative benchmark characteristics expected from solar cells limited by bimolecular recombination. Transient as well as steady state intensity dependent measurements indicate that our solar cells indeed operate at such limits with interface passivation comparable to the champion c-Si technology. Further, we identify novel characterization schemes which enable consistent back extraction of recombination parameters from transient optoelectrical and electroluminescence measurements. Remarkably, these parameters predict important features of dark current density vs. voltage characteristics (J-V) and Suns-V_OC measurements, thus validating the estimates and the methodology. Uniquely, this work provides a consistent and coherent interpretation of diverse experimental trends ranging from dark J-V, Suns-V_OC, steady state and transient intensity dependent measurements to electroluminescence quantum yield. As such, insights shared in this manuscript could have significant implications towards fundamental electronic processes in perovskite solar cells and further efficiency optimization towards Shockley-Queisser limits.</description>

      <title>Surface Phase Diagrams from Nested Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08509v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies in atomic-scale modeling of surface phase equilibria often focus on temperatures near zero Kelvin due to the challenges in calculating the free energy of surfaces at finite temperatures. The Bayesian-inference-based nested sampling (NS) algorithm allows for modeling phase equilibria at arbitrary temperatures by directly and efficiently calculating the partition function, whose relationship with free energy is well known. This work extends NS to calculate adsorbate phase diagrams, incorporating all relevant configurational contributions to the free energy. We apply NS to the adsorption of Lennard-Jones (LJ) gas particles on low-index and vicinal LJ solid surfaces and construct the canonical partition function from these recorded energies to calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic properties, such as the constant-volume heat capacity and order parameters that characterize the structure of adsorbate phases. Key results include determining the nature of phase transitions of adsorbed LJ particles on flat and stepped LJ surfaces, which typically feature an enthalpy-driven condensation at higher temperatures and an entropy-driven reordering process at lower temperatures, and the effect of surface geometry on the presence of triple points in the phase diagrams. Overall, we demonstrate the ability and potential of NS for surface modeling.</description>

      <title>Stable nanofacets in [111] tilt grain boundaries of face-centered cubic metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain boundaries can dissociate into facets if that reduces their excess energy. This, however, introduces line defects at the facet junctions, which present a driving force to grow the facets in order to reduce the total number of junctions and thus the system's energy. Often, micrometer-sized facet lengths are observed and facet growth only arrests for kinetic reasons. So far, energetically stable, finite-sized facets have not been observed, even though theoretical stability conditions have already been proposed. Here, we show a case where nanometer-sized facets are indeed stable compared to longer facets in [111] tilt grain boundaries in Cu by atomistic simulation and transmission electron microscopy. The facet junctions lack a Burgers vector component, which is unusual, but which removes the main energy cost of facet junctions. Only attractive interactions via line forces remain, which result from a discontinuity of grain boundary excess stress at the junction. Atomistic simulations predict that the same phenomenon also occurs in at least Al and Ag.</description>

      <title>Ideas of lattice-basis reduction theory for error-stable Bravais lattice determination and ab-initio indexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ab-initio indexing, for a given diffraction/scattering pattern, the unit-cell parameters and the Miller indices assigned to reflections in the pattern are determined simultaneously. "Ab-initio" means a process performed without any good prior information on the crystal lattice. Newly developed ab-initio indexing software is frequently reported in crystallography. However, it is not widely recognized that use of a Bravais lattice determination method, which is tolerant to experimental errors, can simplify indexing algorithms and increase their success rates. One of the goals of this article is to collect information on the lattice-basis reduction theory and its applications. The main result is Bravais lattice determination algorithm for 2D lattices, along with a mathematical proof that it works even for parameters containing large observational errors. As in our error-stable algorithm for 3D lattices, it uses two lattice-basis reduction methods that seem to be optimal for different symmetries. In indexing, a method for error-stable unit-cell identification is also required to exclude duplicate solutions. We introduce several methods to measure the difference of unit cells known in crystallography and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Abrupt 3D-2D Morphological Transition in Thin Al Layers Grown by MBE on InGaAs surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among superconductor/semiconductor hybrid structures, in-situ aluminum (Al) grown on InGaAs/InAs is widely pursued for the experimental realization of Majorana Zero Mode quasiparticles. This is due to the high carrier mobility, low effective mass, and large Land\'e g-factor of InAs, coupled with the relatively high value of the in-plane critical magnetic field in thin Al films. However, growing a thin, continuous Al layer using the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is challenging due to aluminum's high surface mobility and tendency for 3D nucleation on semiconductor surfaces. A study of epitaxial Al thin film growth on In0.75Ga0.25As with MBE is presented, focusing on the effects of the Al growth rate and substrate temperature on the nucleation of Al layers. We find that for low deposition rates, 0.1 {\AA}/s and 0.5 {\AA}/s, the growth continues in 3D mode during the deposition of the nominal 100 {\AA} of Al, resulting in isolated Al islands. However, for growth rates of 1.5 {\AA}/s and above, the 3D growth mode quickly transitions into island coalescence, leading to a uniform 2D Al layer. Moreover, this transition is very abrupt, happening over an Al flux increase of less than 1%. We discuss the growth mechanisms explaining these observations. The results give new insights into the kinetics of Al deposition and show that with sufficiently high Al flux, a 2D growth on substrates at close to room temperature can be achieved already within the first few Al monolayers. This eliminates the need for complex cryogenic substrate cooling and paves the way for the development of high-quality superconductor-semiconductor interfaces in standard MBE systems.</description>

Abstract: Efros-Shklovskii (ES) Coulomb gap in density of localized states and ES law of the variable range hopping conductivity were coined 50 years ago. The theory and its first confirmations were reviewed in our monograph 40-years ago. This paper reviews the subsequent experimental evidence, theoretical advancements, and novel applications. Out of hundreds of experimental validations of the ES law in a diverse range of materials, I focus on those where the dynamic range of conductivity exceeds four orders of magnitude. These include three- and two-dimensional semiconductors under both zero and high magnetic fields, localized phases in the quantum Hall effect, granular metals, nanocrystal arrays, and conducting polymers. Additionally, this review discusses the Coulomb gap near insulator-metal transition and in non-ohmic ES law. Recent developments of other concepts of the ES book are also discussed.</description>

      <title>BAMBOO: a predictive and transferable machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07181v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a "universal MLFF" capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</description>

Abstract: The ever-increasing amount of data from ubiquitous smart devices fosters data-centric and cognitive algorithms. Traditional digital computer systems have separate logic and memory units, resulting in a huge delay and energy cost for implementing these algorithms. Memristors are programmable resistors with a memory, providing a paradigm-shifting approach towards creating intelligent hardware systems to handle data-centric tasks. Spintronic nanodevices are promising choices as they are high-speed, low-power, highly scalable, robust, and capable of constructing dynamic complex systems. In this Review, we survey spintronic devices from a memristor point of view. We introduce spintronic memristors based on magnetic tunnel junctions, nanomagnet ensemble, domain walls, topological spin textures, and spin waves, which represent dramatically different state spaces. They can exhibit steady, oscillatory, stochastic, and chaotic trajectories in their state spaces, which have been exploited for in-memory logic, neuromorphic computing, stochastic and chaos computing. Finally, we discuss challenges and trends in realizing large-scale spintronic memristive systems for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Fabrication-induced even-odd discrepancy of magnetotransport in few-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>

Abstract: The van der Waals antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 represents a promising platform for exploring the layer-dependent magnetism and topological states of matter. Recently observed discrepancies between magnetic and transport properties have aroused controversies concerning the topological nature of MnBi2Te4 in the ground state. In this article, we demonstrate that fabrication can induce mismatched even-odd layer dependent magnetotransport in few-layer MnBi2Te4. We perform a comprehensive study of the magnetotransport properties in 6- and 7-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4, and reveal that both even- and odd-number-layer device can show zero Hall plateau phenomena in zero magnetic field. Importantly, a statistical survey of the optical contrast in more than 200 MnBi2Te4 flakes reveals that the zero Hall plateau in odd-number-layer devices arises from the reduction of the effective thickness during the fabrication, a factor that was rarely noticed in previous studies of 2D materials. Our finding not only provides an explanation to the controversies regarding the discrepancy of the even-odd layer dependent magnetotransport in MnBi2Te4, but also highlights the critical issues concerning the fabrication and characterization of 2D material devices.</description>

      <title>Operando Insights on the Degradation Mechanisms of Rhenium-doped and Undoped Molybdenum Disulfide Nanocatalysts for Electrolyzer Applications</title>

Abstract: MoS2 nanostructures are promising catalysts for proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to replace expensive noble metals. Their broadscale application demands high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as robust durability. Doping is commonly applied to enhance the HER activity of MoS2-based nanocatalysts, but the effect of dopants in the electrochemical and structural stability is yet to be discussed. Herein, we correlate operando electrochemical measurements to the structural evolution of the materials down to the nanometric scale by identical location electron microscopy and spectroscopy. The range of stable operation for MoS2 nanocatalysts with and without rhenium doping is experimentally defined. The responsible degradation mechanisms at first electrolyte contact, open circuit stabilization and HER conditions are experimentally identified and confirmed with the calculated Pourbaix diagram of Re-doped MoS2. Doping MoS2-based nanocatalysts is validated as a promising strategy for the continuous improvement of high performance and durable PEM electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Odd dipole screening in disordered matter</title>

Abstract: Disordered solids, straddling the solid-fluid boundary, lack a comprehensive continuum mechanical description. They exhibit a complex microstructure wherein multiple meta-stable states exist. Deforming disordered solids induces particles rearrangements enabling the system to transition between meta-stable states. A dramatic consequence of these transitions is that quasistatic deformation cycles modify the reference state, facilitating the storage and release of mechanical energy. Here we develop a continuum mechanical theory of disordered solids, which accounts for the absence of a reference state and the lack of conserved potential energy. Our theory, which introduces a new modulus describing non-conservative mechanical screening, reduces to classical elasticity in the absence of screening. We analytically derive predictions for the deformation field for various perturbations and geometries. While our theory applies to general disordered solids, we focus on a two-dimensional disordered granular system and predict accurately the non-affine displacement fields observed in experiments for both small and large deformations, along with the observable vanishing shear modulus. The new proposed moduli satisfy universal relations that are independent of the specific experimental realization. Our work thus forms the basis of an entirely new family of continuum descriptions of the mechanics of disordered solids.</description>
