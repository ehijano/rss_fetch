      <title>Modules as effective nodes in coarse-grained networks of Kuramoto oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most real-world networks exhibit a significant degree of modularity. Understanding the effects of such topology on dynamical processes is pivotal for advances in social and natural sciences. In this work we consider the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators on modular networks and propose a simple coarse-graining procedure where modules are replaced by effective single oscillators. The method is inspired by EEG measurements, where very large groups of neurons under each electrode are interpreted as single nodes in a correlation network. We expose the interplay between intra-module and inter-module coupling strengths in keeping the coarse-graining process meaningful and show that its accuracy depends on the degree of intra-module synchronization. We show that, when modules are well synchronized, the phase transition from asynchronous to synchronous motion in networks with 2 and 3 modules is very well described by their respective reduced systems, regardless of the network structure connecting the modules. Application of the method to real networks with small modularity coefficients, on the other hand, reveals that the approximation is not accurate, although it still allows for the computation of the critical coupling and the qualitative behavior of the order parameter if the inter-module coupling is large enough.</description>

      <title>Origins of Instability in Dynamical Systems on Undirected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness to perturbation is a key topic in the study of complex systems occurring across a wide variety of applications from epidemiology to biochemistry. Here we analyze the eigenspectrum of the Jacobian matrices associated to a general class of networked dynamical systems, which contains information on how perturbations to a stationary state develop over time. We find that stability is always determined by a spectral outlier, but with pronounced differences to the corresponding eigenvector in different regimes. We show that, depending on model details, instability may originate in nodes of anomalously low or high degree, or may occur everywhere in the network at once. Importantly, the dependence on extremal degrees results in considerable finite-size effects with different scaling depending on the ensemble degree distribution. Our results have potentially useful applications in network monitoring to predict or prevent catastrophic failures, and we validate our analytical findings through applications to epidemic dynamics and gene regulatory systems.</description>

      <title>Phase locking and multistability in the topological Kuramoto model on cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological Kuramoto model generalizes classical synchronization models by including higher-order interactions, with oscillator dynamics defined on cells of arbitrary dimension within simplicial or cell complexes. In this article, we demonstrate multistability in the topological Kuramoto model and develop the topological nonlinear Kirchhoff conditions algorithm to identify all phase-locked states on arbitrary cell complexes. The algorithm is based on a generalization of Kirchhoff's laws to cell complexes of arbitrary dimension and nonlinear interactions between cells. By applying this framework to rings, Platonic solids, and simplexes, as minimal representative motifs of larger networks, we derive explicit bounds (based on winding number constraints) that determine the number of coexisting stable states. We uncover structural cascades of multistability, inherited from both lower and higher dimensions and demonstrate that cell complexes can generate richer multistability patterns than simplicial complexes of the same dimension. Moreover, we find that multistability patterns in cell complexes appear to be determined by the number of boundary cells, hinting a possible universal pattern.</description>

      <title>How Conflict Aversion Can Enable Authoritarianism: An Evolutionary Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use evolutionary game theory to examine how conflict-averse centrism can facilitate authoritarian success in polarized political conflicts. Such conflicts are often asymmetric: authoritarian actors can employ norm-breaking or coercive tactics, while democratic resistance faces stronger normative constraints on acceptable behavior. Yet formal models typically treat sides symmetrically and rarely examine conflict-averse behavior. Drawing on empirical research on protest backlash, civility norms, and authoritarian resilience, we model these dynamics as a three-strategy evolutionary game. This framework yields two outcomes -- cyclic authoritarian resurgence through a heteroclinic cycle and a stable centrist--authoritarian coalition excluding resistance -- depending on confrontation responses. We demonstrate how an established dynamical framework with empirically grounded behavioral assumptions clarifies conditions under which conflict aversion can diminish the effectiveness of democratic resistance.</description>
