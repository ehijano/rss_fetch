      <title>Metabolic scaling from Fibonacci dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a discrete model to determine the metabolic scaling exponent based on Fibonacci growth patterns and discrete biological development phases. In contrast to continuous fractal models such as the West-Brown-Enquist (WBE) theory, the present approach describes metabolic scaling as the cumulative result of successive discrete stages, each incrementally contributing to metabolic activity. The scaling exponent b(n) emerges naturally from the logarithmic relationship between consecutive Fibonacci numbers, varying systematically with the organism's developmental stage. A refined logarithmic formulation significantly enhances quantitative agreement with empirical metabolic data across various mammalian species. This discrete framework effectively captures deviations from classical scaling laws, directly connecting recursive hierarchical structures with metabolic processes. Our model provides an alternative to traditional fractal transport approaches and can be naturally extended to hierarchical physical systems, opening new avenues to explore stage-dependent scaling phenomena in complex adaptive systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Modeling of Border Cell Cluster Migration in Drosophila</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective cell migration is a fundamental biological process that drives events such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. In this study, we develop a biophysically informed phase-field model to investigate the collective migration of the border cell cluster in the Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber. Our model captures key aspects of the egg chamber architecture, including the oocyte, nurse cells, and surrounding epithelium, and incorporates both mechanical forces and biochemical cues that guide cell migration. We introduce the Tangential Interface Migration (TIM) force which captures contact-mediated propulsion generated along interfaces between the border cell cluster and surrounding nurse cells. Our simulations reveal three key features of TIM-driven migration that distinguish it from previous forms of chemotaxis: (1) the necessity of border cell-nurse cell overlap to initiate movement (i.e., border cells cannot move without a nurse cell substrate), (2) motion is tangential to border cell-nurse cell interfaces, and (3) persistent migration even in regions where the spatial slope of chemoattractant is decreasing. Additionally, we demonstrate that with or without geometry-mediated alterations in chemoattractant distribution such as at intercellular junctions we can vary induced migration pauses, independent of mechanical confinement. We capture an experimentally observed transition to dorsal migration at the oocyte with a sustained medio-lateral chemical cue of small amplitude. The results show how spatial constraints and interfacial forces shape collective cell movement and highlight the utility of phase-field models in capturing the interplay between tissue geometry, contact forces, and chemical signaling.</description>

      <title>DNA Dynamics in Dual Nanopore Tug-of-War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid state nanopores have emerged as powerful tools for single-molecule sensing, yet the rapid uncontrolled translocation of the molecule through the pore remains a key limitation. We have previously demonstrated that an active dual-nanopore system, consisting of two closely spaced pores operated via feedback controlled biasing, shows promise in achieving controlled, slowed-down translocation. Translocation control is achieved via capturing the DNA in a special tug-of-war configuration, whereby opposing electrophoretic forces at each pore are applied to a DNA molecule co-captured at the two pores. Here, we systematically explore translocation physics during DNA tug-of-war focusing on genomically relevant longer dsDNA using a T$_4$-DNA model (166\,kbp). We find that longer molecules can be trapped in tug-of-war states with an asymmetric partitioning of contour between the pores. Secondly, we explore the physics of DNA disengagement from a tug-of-war configuration, focusing on the dynamics of DNA free-end escape, in particular how the free-end velocity depends on pore voltage, DNA size and the presence of additional DNA strands between the pores (i.e. arising in the presence of folded translocation). These findings validate theoretical predictions derived from a first passage model and provide new insight into the physical mechanisms governing molecule disengagement in tug-of-war.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Rate -- Linear Noise Approximation and Exact Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient information processing is crucial for both living organisms and engineered systems. The mutual information rate, a core concept of information theory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of input and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in dynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate is the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output trajectories follow Gaussian statistics. However, this method is limited to linear systems, and its accuracy in nonlinear or discrete systems remains unclear. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation for non-Gaussian systems by leveraging Path Weight Sampling (PWS), a recent technique for exactly computing the mutual information rate. In two case studies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation. First, we focus on discrete linear systems and demonstrate that, even when the system's statistics are nearly Gaussian, the Gaussian approximation fails to accurately estimate the mutual information rate. Second, we explore a continuous diffusive system with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations between the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as nonlinearity increases. Our results provide a quantitative evaluation of the Gaussian approximation's performance across different stochastic models and highlight when more computationally intensive methods, such as PWS, are necessary.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorem and optimal control of an active tracking particle with information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling.We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived.Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system.Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.</description>

      <title>A universal animal communication tempo resonates with the receiver's brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During fieldwork in Thailand we observed nearly identical frequencies of co-located flashing fireflies and chirping crickets. Motivated by this, we perform a meta-analysis and show an abundance of evolutionarily distinct species that communicate isochronously at ~0.5-4 Hz, suggesting that this might be a frequency "hotspot." We hypothesize that this timescale may have a universal basis in the biophysics of the receiver's neurons. We test this by demonstrating that small receiver circuits constructed from elements representing typical neurons will be most responsive in the observed frequency range.</description>

      <title>Suppression of errors in collectively coded information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires highly processive copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligos that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even if the mutation rate is above the error catastrophe for a physically intact genome.</description>

      <title>Why epithelial cells collectively move against a traveling signal wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.12955v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The response of cell populations to external stimuli plays a central role in biological mechanical processes such as epithelial wound healing and developmental morphogenesis. Wave-like propagation of a signal of ERK MAP kinase has been shown to direct collective migration in one direction; however, the mechanism based on continuum mechanics under a traveling wave is not fully understood. To elucidate how the traveling wave of the ERK kinase signal directs collective migration, we constructed the mechanical model of the epithelial cell monolayer by considering the signal-dependent coordination of contractile stress and cellular orientation. The proposed model was studied by using an optogenetically-controlled cell system where we found that local signal activation induces changes in cell density and orientation with the direction of propagation. The net motion of the cell population occurred relative to the wave, and the migration velocity showed a maximum in resonance with the velocity of the ERK signal wave. The presented mechanical model was further validated in \textit{in vitro} wound healing process.</description>

      <title>Many Will Enter, Few Will Win: Cost and Sensitivity of Exploratory Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of biomolecular systems rely on exploratory dynamics to reach target locations or states within a cell. Without a mechanism to remotely sense and move directly towards a target, the system must sample over many paths, often including resetting transitions back to the origin. We investigate how exploratory dynamics can confer an important functional benefit: the ability to respond to small changes in parameters with large shifts in the steady-state behavior. However, such enhanced sensitivity comes at a cost: resetting cycles require energy dissipation in order to push the system out of its equilibrium steady state. We focus on minimalist models for two concrete examples: translational proofreading in the ribosome and microtubule length control via dynamic instability to illustrate the trade-offs between energetic cost and sensitivity. In the former, a driven hydrolysis step enhances the ability to distinguish between substrates and decoys with small binding energy differences. In the latter, resetting cycles enable catalytic control, with the steady-state length distribution modulated by sub-stoichiometric concentrations of a reusable catalyst. Synthesizing past models of these well-studied systems, we show how path-counting and circuit mapping approaches can be used to address fundamental questions such as the number of futile cycles inherent in translation and the steady-state length distribution of a dynamically unstable polymer. In both cases, a limited amount of thermodynamic driving is sufficient to yield a qualitative transition to a system with enhanced sensitivity, enabling accurate discrimination and catalytic control at a modest energetic cost.</description>
