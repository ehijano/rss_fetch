      <title>Game Theory in Social Media: A Stackelberg Model of Collaboration, Conflict, and Algorithmic Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms are ecosystems in which many decisions are constantly made for the benefit of the creators in order to maximize engagement, which leads to a maximization of income. The decisions, ranging from collaboration to public conflict or ``beefing,'' are heavily influenced by social media algorithms, viewer preferences, and sponsor risk. This paper models this interaction as a Stackelberg game in which the algorithm is the leader, setting exposure and reward rules, and the content creators are the followers, who optimize their content to maximize engagement. It focuses on two influencer strategies of collaborating and beefing. Viewer preferences are modeled indirectly through the algorithm's utility function, which rewards engagement metrics like click-through rate and watch time. Our simplified game-theoretic model demonstrates how different algorithmic priorities can shift creator strategies and provides insight into the equilibrium dynamics of social media influence.</description>

      <title>Designing DSIC Mechanisms for Data Sharing in the Era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints. Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards. All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation. Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.</description>

      <title>Beating the Logarithmic Barrier for the Subadditive Maximin Share Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of indivisible goods for subadditive agents. While constant-\textsf{MMS} bounds have been given for additive and fractionally subadditive agents, the best existential bound for the case of subadditive agents is $1/O(\log n \log \log n)$. In this work, we improve this bound to a $1/O((\log \log n)^2)$-\textsf{MMS} guarantee. To this end, we introduce new matching techniques and rounding methods for subadditive valuations that we believe are of independent interest and will find their applications in future work.</description>

      <title>Multi-Project Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new class of contract design problems where a principal delegates the execution of multiple projects to a set of agents. The principal's expected reward from each project is a combinatorial function of the agents working on it. Each agent has limited capacity and can work on at most one project, and the agents are heterogeneous, with different costs and contributions for participating in different projects. The main challenge of the principal is to decide how to allocate the agents to projects when the number of projects grows in scale.
  We analyze this problem under different assumptions on the structure of the expected reward functions. As our main result, for XOS functions we show how to derive a constant approximation to the optimal multi-project contract in polynomial time, given access to value and demand oracles. Along the way (and of possible independent interest), we develop approximate demand queries for \emph{capped} subadditive functions, by reducing to demand queries for the original functions. Our work paves the way to combinatorial contract design in richer settings.</description>

      <title>Information Bargaining: Bilateral Commitment in Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05876v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an informed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's actions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver to verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating cooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces computational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions, where the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes and future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the bargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and well-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable properties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction between two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational advantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the standard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the game structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities, thereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information bargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage validation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We then apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with what our information-bargaining framework suggests. All code, results, and terminal logs are publicly available at github.com/YueLin301/InformationBargaining.</description>

      <title>Microgrids Coalitions for Energy Market Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution networks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy market has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may face imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability at the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal coalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or supply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient management of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that identify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of the energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the optimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of population of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and mutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total value generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when the energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the energy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the profit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during periods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy on the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the trading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members, according to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to the formation of collective value.</description>

      <title>Longer Lists Yield Better Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many centralized mechanisms for two-sided matching markets that enjoy strong theoretical properties assume that the planner solicits full information on the preferences of each participating agent. In particular, they expect that participants compile and communicate their complete preference lists over agents from the other side of the market. However, real-world markets are often very large and agents cannot always be expected to even produce a ranking of all options on the other side. It is therefore important to understand the impact of incomplete or truncated lists on the quality of the resultant matching.
  In this paper, we focus on the Serial Dictatorship mechanism in a model where each agent of the proposing side (students) has a random preference list of length $d$, sampled independently and uniformly at random from $n$ schools, each of which has one seat. Our main result shows that if the students primarily care about being matched to any school of their list (as opposed to ending up unmatched), then all students in position $i\leq n$ will prefer markets with longer lists, when $n$ is large enough. Schools on the other hand will always prefer longer lists in our model. We moreover investigate the impact of $d$ on the rank of the school that a student gets matched to.
  Our main result suggests that markets that are well-approximated by our hypothesis and where the demand of schools does not exceed supply should be designed with preference lists as long as reasonable, since longer lists would favor all agents.</description>

      <title>A Direct Reduction from Stochastic Parity Games to Simple Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been recently achieved in developing efficient solutions for simple stochastic games (SSGs), focusing on reachability objectives. While reductions from stochastic parity games (SPGs) to SSGs have been presented in the literature through the use of multiple intermediate game models, a direct and simple reduction has been notably absent. This paper introduces a novel and direct polynomial-time reduction from quantitative SPGs to quantitative SSGs. By leveraging a gadget-based transformation that effectively removes the priority function, we construct an SSG that simulates the behavior of a given SPG. We formally establish the correctness of our direct reduction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under binary encoding this reduction is polynomial, thereby directly corroborating the known $\textbf{NP}\,\mathbf{\cap}\,\textbf{coNP}$ complexity of SPGs and providing new understanding in the relationship between parity and reachability objectives in turn-based stochastic games.</description>

      <title>Beyond Winning Strategies: Admissible and Admissible Winning Strategies for Quantitative Reachability Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical reactive synthesis approaches aim to synthesize a reactive system that always satisfies a given specifications. These approaches often reduce to playing a two-player zero-sum game where the goal is to synthesize a winning strategy. However, in many pragmatic domains, such as robotics, a winning strategy does not always exist, yet it is desirable for the system to make an effort to satisfy its requirements instead of "giving up". To this end, this paper investigates the notion of admissible strategies, which formalize "doing-your-best", in quantitative reachability games. We show that, unlike the qualitative case, quantitative admissible strategies are history-dependent even for finite payoff functions, making synthesis a challenging task. In addition, we prove that admissible strategies always exist but may produce undesirable optimistic behaviors. To mitigate this, we propose admissible winning strategies, which enforce the best possible outcome while being admissible. We show that both strategies always exist but are not memoryless. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of both strategies and propose synthesis algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the strategies on gridworld and robot manipulator domains.</description>

      <title>The Bakers and Millers Game with Restricted Locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study strategic location choice by customers and sellers, termed the Bakers and Millers Game in the literature. In our generalized setting, each miller can freely choose any location for setting up a mill, while each baker is restricted in the choice of location for setting up a bakery. For optimal bargaining power, a baker would like to select a location with many millers to buy flour from and with little competition from other bakers. Likewise, a miller aims for a location with many bakers and few competing millers. Thus, both types of agents choose locations to optimize the ratio of agents of opposite type divided by agents of the same type at their chosen location. Originally raised in the context of Fractional Hedonic Games, the Bakers and Millers Game has applications that range from commerce to product design.
  We study the impact of location restrictions on the properties of the game. While pure Nash equilibria trivially exist in the setting without location restrictions, we show via a sophisticated, efficient algorithm that even the more challenging restricted setting admits equilibria. Moreover, the computed equilibrium approximates the optimal social welfare by a factor of at most $2\left(\frac{e}{e-1}\right)$. Furthermore, we give tight bounds on the price of anarchy/stability.
  On the conceptual side, the location choice feature adds a new layer to the standard setting of Hedonic Games, in the sense that agents that select the same location form a coalition. This allows to naturally restrict the possible coalitions that can be formed. With this, our model generalizes simple symmetric Fractional Hedonic Games on complete bipartite valuation graphs and also Hedonic Diversity Games with utilities single-peaked at 0. We believe that this generalization is also a very interesting direction for other types of Hedonic Games.</description>

      <title>Pool Formation in Oceanic Games: Shapley Value and Proportional Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a game-theoretic model for pool formation in Proof of Stake blockchain protocols. In such systems, stakeholders can form pools as a means of obtaining regular rewards from participation in ledger maintenance, with the power of each pool being dependent on its collective stake. The question we are interested in is the design of mechanisms that suitably split rewards among pool members and achieve favorable properties in the resulting pool configuration. With this in mind, we initiate a non-cooperative game-theoretic analysis of the well known Shapley value scheme from cooperative game theory into the context of blockchains. In particular, we focus on the oceanic model of games, proposed by Milnor and Shapley (1978), which is suitable for populations where a small set of large players coexists with a big mass of rather small, negligible players. This provides an appropriate level of abstraction for pool formation processes among the stakeholders. We provide comparisons between the Shapley mechanism and the more standard proportional scheme, in terms of attained decentralization, via a Price of Stability analysis and in terms of susceptibility to Sybil attacks, i.e., the strategic splitting of a players' stake with the intention of participating in multiple pools for increased profit. Interestingly, while the widely deployed proportional scheme appears to have certain advantages, the Shapley value scheme, which rewards higher the most pivotal players, emerges as a competitive alternative, by being able to bypass some of the downsides of proportional sharing, while also not being far from optimal guarantees w.r.t. decentralization. Finally, we complement our study with some variations of proportional sharing, where the profit is split in proportion to a superadditive or a subadditive function of the stake, showing that the Shapley value scheme still maintains the same advantages.</description>

      <title>User Altruism in Recommendation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (RecSys) (e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to "boost" its recommendation; we term this behavior user altruism. To capture this behavior, we study a game between users and a RecSys, where users provide the RecSys (potentially manipulated) preferences over the contents available to them, and the RecSys -- limited by data and computation constraints -- creates a low-rank approximation preference matrix, and ultimately provides each user her (approximately) most-preferred item. We compare the users' social welfare under truthful preference reporting and under a class of strategies capturing user altruism. In our theoretical analysis, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure strict increases in user social welfare under user altruism, and provide an algorithm to find an effective altruistic strategy. Interestingly, we show that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effectively altruistic strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys! We show that our results are robust to several model misspecifications, thus strengthening our conclusions. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective altruistic strategies on the GoodReads dataset, and an online survey on how real-world users behave altruistically in RecSys. Overall, our findings serve as a proof-of-concept of the reasons why traditional RecSys may incentivize users to form collectives and/or follow altruistic strategies when interacting with them.</description>

      <title>Clone-Robust Weights in Metric Spaces: Handling Redundancy Bias for Benchmark Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are given a set of elements in a metric space. The distribution of the elements is arbitrary, possibly adversarial. Can we weigh the elements in a way that is resistant to such (adversarial) manipulations? This problem arises in various contexts. For instance, the elements could represent data points, requiring robust domain adaptation. Alternatively, they might represent tasks to be aggregated into a benchmark; or questions about personal political opinions in voting advice applications. This article introduces a theoretical framework for dealing with such problems. We propose clone-proof weighting functions as a solution concept. These functions distribute importance across elements of a set such that similar objects (``clones'') share (some of) their weights, thus avoiding a potential bias introduced by their multiplicity. Our framework extends the maximum uncertainty principle to accommodate general metric spaces and includes a set of axioms -- symmetry, continuity, and clone-proofness -- that guide the construction of weighting functions. Finally, we address the existence of weighting functions satisfying our axioms in the significant case of Euclidean spaces and propose a general method for their construction.</description>
