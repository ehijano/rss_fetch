      <title>The behaviour of the DC current density at the edge of electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the complete electrode model boundary condition for second order elliptic PDE. A specific case of this is the PDE describing the electrostatic potential for a conductive body into which current is injected through electrodes that touch the boundary. We obtain the optimal description of the gradient of the electrostatic potential upon approach to the edge of the electrodes.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of some model arising in the mathematical biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article we establish the global well-posedness in W^{1, 2, 2}(R\times R^{+}) of the integro-differential equation in the case of the anomalous diffusion when the one dimensional negative Laplace operator is raised to a fractional power in the presence of the transport term. The model is relevant to the cell population dynamics in the Mathematical Biology. Our proof relies on a fixed point technique.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider optimization problems for interacting particle systems. We show that critical points solve a Vlasov equation, and that in general no minimizers exist despite continuity of the action functional. We prove an explicit representation of the relaxation of the action functional. We show convergence of N-particle minimizers to minimizers of the relaxed action, and finally characterize minimizers of dynamic interacting particle optimal transport problems as solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.</description>

      <title>Smoothing estimates for weakly nonlinear internal waves in a rotating ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the effect of rotation on nonlinear wave phenomena in weakly dispersive media modeled by the Korteweg-de Vries equation on the real line. It is well known that smoothing in the case of the KdV equation with periodic boundary conditions is a result of the presence of high frequency waves that weaken the nonlinearity through time averaging, \cite{bit}, \cite{et1}. High frequency interactions through normal form transformations can be thought of as adding a fast rotating term in certain toy PDE models that arrest the development of singularities, \cite{bit}. It is crucial for this phenomena that the zero Fourier mode can be removed due to the conservation of the mean. On the real line this mechanism breaks down as the resonance sets close to zero frequency are sizable and normal form transformations are not useful, \cite{imt}, and hence smoothing fails. The model we study is a perturbation of the KdV equation on a rotating frame of reference. A combination of a suitable normal form transformation along with the restricted norm method of Bourgain \cite{Bou2} implies smoothing on the real line.</description>

      <title>Optimal pinwheel partitions and pinwheel solutions to a nonlinear Schr\"odinger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a solution to a nonlinear competitive Schr\"odinger system whose scalar potential tends to a positive constant at infinity with an appropriate rate. This solution has the property that all components are invariant under the action of a group of linear isometries and each component is obtained from the previous one by composing it with some fixed linear isometry. We call it a pinwheel solution. We describe the asymptotic behavior of the least energy pinwheel solutions when the competing parameter tends to zero and to minus infinity. In the latter case the components are segregated and give rise to an optimal pinwheel partition for the Schr\"odinger equation, that is, a partition formed by invariant sets that are mutually isometric through a fixed isometry.</description>

      <title>A beam that can only bend on the Cantor set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we address the following question: is it possible for a one-dimensional, linearly elastic beam to only bend on the Cantor set and, if so, what would the bending energy of such a beam look like? We answer this question by considering a sequence of beams, indexed by $n$, each one only able to bend on the set associated with the $n$-th step in the construction of the Cantor set and compute the $\Gamma$-limit of the bending energies. The resulting energy in the limit has a structure similar to the traditional bending energy, a key difference being that the measure used for the integration is the Hausdorff measure of dimension $\ln 2/\ln 3$, which is the dimension of the Cantor set.</description>

      <title>On the existence of positive solution for a Neumann problem with double critical exponents in half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and nonexistence of positive solution for a Neumann problem with double critical exponents and fast increasing weighted in half-space. This problem is closely related to the study of self-similar solutions for nonlinear heat equation. By applying the Mountain Pass Theorem without (PS) condition and the delicate estimates for the Mountain Pass level, we obtain the existence of a positive solution under different assumptions. Meanwhile, some nonexistence results for this problem is also obtained by an improved Pohozaev identity and Hardy inequality according to the value of the parameters. Particularly, we give the best lower bound of the parameter for the existence of a positive solution of this problem if dimension N=4.</description>

      <title>On the vorticity threshold for steady water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of two-dimensional water waves characterized by a significant adverse constant vorticity over flows without stagnation points. Surprisingly, we discover qualitative distinctions between this scenario and those featuring favorable vorticity. Our findings reveal that in the presence of large adverse vorticity, neither Stokes waves nor solitary waves can approach extreme waves exhibiting surface stagnation points. Conversely, we demonstrate that global bifurcation curves always lead to unidirectional Stokes and solitary waves with precisely one stagnation point located at the bottom right beneath the crest. In contrast, it is known that any favorable or even small adverse vorticity eliminates the possibility of bottom stagnation, leading to extreme waves exhibiting surface singularities. Additionally, we establish several novel facts, including new bounds for both amplitude and the Froude number.</description>

      <title>Diffusive logistic equation with a non Lipschitz nonlinear boundary condition arising from coastal fishery harvesting: the resonant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For bifurcation analysis, we study the positive solution set for a semilinear elliptic equation of the logistic type, equipped with a sublinear boundary condition modeling coastal fishery harvesting. This work is a continuation of the author's previous studies, where certain results were obtained in a non resonant case, including the existence, uniqueness, multiplicity, and strong positivity for positive solutions. In this paper, we consider the delicate resonant case and develop a sort of non standard bifurcation technique at zero to evaluate the positive solution set depending on a parameter. The nonlinear boundary condition is not right-differentiable at zero.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for Sobolev critical Schr\"{o}dinger equations on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions with prescribed $L^2$-norm for the Sobolev critical Schr\"odinger equation on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\ge3$: \[ -\Delta U = \lambda U + U^{2^{*}-1},\qquad U\in H^1_0(\Omega),\qquad \int_\Omega U^2\,dx = \rho^{2}, \] where $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$.
  First, we consider a general bounded domain $\Omega$ in dimension $N\ge3$, with a restriction, only in dimension $N=3$, involving its inradius and first Dirichlet eigenvalue. In this general case we show the existence of a mountain pass solution on the $L^2$-sphere, for $\rho$ belonging to a subset of positive measure of the interval $(0,\rho^{**})$, for a suitable threshold $\rho^{**}&gt;0$. Next, assuming that $\Omega$ is star-shaped, we extend the previous result to all values $\rho\in(0,\rho^{**})$.
  With respect to that of local minimizers, already known in the literature, the existence of mountain pass solutions in the Sobolev critical case is much more elusive. In particular, our proofs are based on the sharp analysis of the bounded Palais-Smale sequences, provided by a nonstandard adaptation of the Struwe monotonicity trick, that we develop.</description>

      <title>Global solvability for the Boussinesq system with fractional Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the global solvability for the Boussinesq system with fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq3$. It proves the existence of a small positive number $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(n,\alpha)$ such that for each $0&lt;T&lt;\infty$, if $\frac{1}{2}&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{2+n}{4}$ and $\|u_{0}\|_{\dot{H}^{s_{0}}}+T^{1/2}\|\theta_{0}\|_{\dot{H}^{s_{0}-\alpha}}\leq \varepsilon$, then the fractional Boussinesq system has a unique strong solution on the bounded interval $[0,T]$. If $\frac{1}{2}&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{2+n}{6}$ and $\|u_{0}\|_{\dot{H}^{s_{0}}}+\|\theta_{0}\|_{\dot{H}^{s_{0}-2\alpha}}\leq \varepsilon$, then the fractional Boussinesq system has a unique strong solution on the whole interval $[0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and numerical justification of an effective micro-macro model for reactive transport in elastic perforated media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an effective model for reactive transport in elastically deformable perforated media. This model was derived by formal asymptotic expansions in [25], starting from a microscopic model consisting of a linear elasticity problem on a fixed domain, i.e. in the Lagrangian framework, and a problem for reactive transport on the current deformed domain, i.e. in the Eulerian framework. The effective model is of micro-macro type and features strong non-linear couplings. Here, we prove global existence in time and uniqueness for the effective micro-macro model under a smallness assumption for the data of the macroscopic elasticity subproblem. Moreover, we show numerically the convergence of microscopic solutions towards the solution of the effective model when the scale parameter {\epsilon} &gt; 0 becomes smaller and smaller, and also compute the approximation error. The numerical justification of the formally derived effective micro-macro model is particularly important, as rigorous analytical convergence proofs or error estimates are not available so far. Finally, we compare the effective micro-macro model with alternative, simpler effective descriptions of transport in elastic perforated media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of existence and properties of solitary waves of the Benjamin equation. The studied equation includes a parameter $ \gamma $ in front of the Benjamin-Ono term. % whose change in sign changes in turn certain properties of the energy. We show the existence, uniqueness, decay and orbital stability of solitary wave solutions obtained as a solution to a certain minimization problem, associated either with high speeds without sign condition on the parameter $\gamma$ or with small speeds for the appropriate sign. For any $ \gamma\in \mathbb{R}^* $, we prove the uniqueness and orbital stability of fast even ground state solitary waves. We also prove the uniqueness and orbital stability of slow ground state solitary waves for $ \gamma&gt;0 $.</description>

      <title>A free boundary problem for an immersed filament in 3D Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a simplified extensible version of a dynamic free boundary problem for a thin filament with radius $\epsilon&gt;0$ immersed in 3D Stokes flow. The 3D fluid is coupled to the quasi-1D filament dynamics via a novel type of angle-averaged Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator for the Stokes equations, and much of the difficulty in the analysis lies in understanding this operator. Here we show that the main part of this angle-averaged NtD map about a closed, curved filament is the corresponding operator about a straight filament, for which we can derive an explicit symbol. Remainder terms due to curvature are lower order with respect to regularity or size in $\epsilon$. Using this operator decomposition, it is then possible to show that the simplified free boundary evolution is a third-order parabolic equation and is locally well posed. This establishes a more complete mathematical foundation for the myriad computational results based on slender body approximations for thin immersed elastic structures.</description>

      <title>A Fast Observability for Diffusion Equations in $\mathbb R^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04945</link>

Abstract: Given an equidistributed set in the whole Euclidean space, we have established in [1] that there exists a constant positive $C$ such that the observability inequality of diffusion equations holds for all $T\in]0,1[$, with an observability cost being of the form $Ce^{C/T}$. In this paper, for any small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we prove that there exists a nontrivial equidistributed set (in the sense that whose complementary set is unbounded), so that the above observability cost can be improved to a fast form of $Ce^{\varepsilon/T}$ for certain constant $C&gt;0$. The proof is based on the strategy used in [1], as well as an interpolation inequality for gradients of solutions to elliptic equations obtained recently in [2].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stationary Swift--Hohenberg equation $(\Delta + 1)^2 u - \alpha u - \beta u^2 + u^3=0$ in the whole space $\mathbb R^n$, $2\le n \le 7$. We develop and modify the variational approach introduced by Lerman, Naryshkin and Nazarov (2020) and obtain a series of periodic solutions with certain additional symmetries.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation in variable Lebesgue spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are mainly concerned with the well-posedness of the dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation in the framework of variable Lebesgue spaces. Based on some analytical results developed in the variable Lebesgue spaces and the $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ decay estimates of the fractional heat kernel, we establish, for the 2D dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation, the global well-posedness in the space $\mathcal{L}^{p(\cdot)}_{\frac{2}{\alpha-1}}(\mathbb{R}^{2},L^{\infty}(0,\infty))$ and the local well-posedness in the space $L^{q(\cdot)}(0,T; L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{2}))$.</description>

      <title>Longtime Asymptotic Behavior of Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Type Equations with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of nonlinear Fokker-Planck type equations in a bounded domain with periodic boundary conditions. The system is motivated by our study of grain boundary dynamics, especially under the non-isothermal environments. To obtain the long time behavior of the solutions, in particular, the exponential decay, the kinematic structures of the systems are investigated using novel reinterpretation of the classical entropy method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by an analysis on the well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem for the motion of an inextensible hanging string, we first consider an initial boundary value problem for one-dimensional degenerate hyperbolic systems with a localized term and show its well-posedness in weighted Sobolev spaces. We then consider the linearized system for the motion of an inextensible hanging string. Well-posedness of its initial boundary value problem is demonstrated as an application of the result obtained in the first part.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new measure for the stability of structures, such as the cross-section of the deck of a suspension bridge, subject to a 2D fluid force, such as the lift exerted by a laminar wind. We consider a wide class of possible flows, as well as a wide class of structural shapes. Within a suitable topological framework, we prove the existence of an optimal shape maximizing the stability. Applications to engineering problems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Global solutions to quadratic systems of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations in space-dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of global-in-time regular solutions to a system of stochastic quadratic reaction-diffusion equations. Global-in-time existence is based on a $L^\infty$-estimate obtained by an approach {\`a} la De Giorgi, as in [GoudonVasseur10]. The adaptation of this technique to the stochastic case requires in its final step an $L^2\ln(L^2)$-bound, furnished by an estimate by duality on the entropy inequality, as in [DesvillettesFellnerPierreVovelle07]. In our stochastic context, and similarly to [DebusscheRoselloVovelle2021], we need to solve a backward SPDE to exploit the duality technique</description>

      <title>On Optimal Transport Maps Between 1 /d-Concave Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the scope of Caffarelli's contraction theorem, which provides a measure of the Lipschitz constant for optimal transport maps between log-concave probability densities in $\R^d$. Our focus is on a broader category of densities, specifically those that are $\nicefrac{1}{d}$-concave and can be represented as $V^{-d}$, where $V$ is convex. By setting appropriate conditions, we derive linear or sublinear limitations for the optimal transport map. This leads us to a comprehensive Lipschitz estimate that aligns with the principles established in Caffarelli's theorem.</description>

      <title>Hardy and Rellich identities and inequalities for Grushin operators via spherical vector fields and Bessel pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Grushin vector fields, we prove Hardy, Hardy-Rellich, and Rellich identities and inequalities with sharp constants. Our explicit remainder terms significantly improve those found in the literature. Our arguments build on abstract Hardy-Rellich identities involving the Bessel pair along with the use of spherical harmonics developed by Garofalo-Shen [Ann. Inst. Fourier (1994)]. Furthermore, in the spirit of Bez-Machihara-Ozawa [Math. Z (2023)], we construct spherical vector fields that correspond to the Grushin vector fields and prove identities that, in turn, establish optimal Rellich identities by comparing the Grushin operator with its radial and spherical components. We give alternate proofs of Hardy identities and inequalities with enhanced Hardy constants in some subspaces of the Sobolev space, among other things. Additionally, we compute the deficit involving $L^2$-norm of the Laplacian and radial components of the Laplacian for the Grushin operator with an explicit remainder term, which leads to a comparison of Laplacian with the radial components of the Laplacian. As a consequence of the main results, new second-order Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principles and Hydrogen uncertainty principles are also derived. Furthermore, we also derive certain symmetrization principles on the Grushin space.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ estimate for the gain term of the Boltzmann collision operator and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev type $L^p$ estimates for the gain term of the Boltzmann collision operator including Maxwellian molecule, hard potential and hard sphere models. Combining with the results of Alonso et al. [2] for the soft potential and Maxwellian molecule models, we provide an unified form of $L^p$ estimates for all cutoff models which are sharp in the sense of scaling. The most striking feature of our new estimates for the hard potential and hard sphere models is that they do not increase the moment, the same as Maxwellian molecule and soft potential models. Based on these novelties, we prove the global existence and scattering of the non-negative unique mild solution for the Cauchy problem of the Boltzmann equation when the positive initial data is small in the weighted $L^3_{x,v}$ space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sedimenting suspension in a Stokes flow, in the presence of a vertical wall. We study the effect of a particle-depleted fluid layer near the wall on the bulk dynamics of the suspension. We show that this effect can be captured by an appropriate wall law of Navier type. We provide in this way a rigorous justification of the apparent slip observed in many experiments. We also discuss the phenomenon of intrinsic convection predicted in some physics articles.</description>

Abstract: Kow, Larson, Salo and Shahgholian recently initiated the study of quadrature domains for the Helmholtz equation and developed an associated theory of partial balayage of measures. The present paper offers an alternative approach to partial balayage in this context that yields stronger results. Applications are given to quadrature domains and to a domain evolution question that is analogous to Hele-Shaw flow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the global well-posedeness of the heat equation with variable time-dependent nonlinearity of the form $\varphi(t)f(u)$ on unimodular Lie groups when the differential operator arises as the sum of squares of H\"ormander vector fields. For general unimodular Lie groups, we derive the necessary conditions for the nonexistence of global positive solutions. This gives different conditions in the cases of compact, polynomial, and exponential volume growth groups. In the case of the Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, we also derive sufficient conditions, which coincide with the necessary ones in the case of $\mathbb{H}^{1}$ (and this is also true for $\mathbb{R}^{n}$). In particular, in the case of the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^{1}$ we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the aforesaid initial value problem with variable nonlinearity has a global positive solution.</description>

      <title>Local behaviour of non-local hypoelliptic equations: divergence form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Strong Harnack inequality for a class of hypoelliptic integro-differential equations in divergence form. The proof is based on a priori estimates, and as such extends the first non-stochastic approach of the non-local parabolic Strong Harnack inequality by Kassmann-Weidner [arXiv:2303.05975] to hypoelliptic equations. In a first step, we derive a local bound on the non-local tail on upper level sets by exploiting the coercivity of the cross terms. In a second step, we perform a De Giorgi argument in $L^1$, since we control the tail term only in $L^1$. This yields a linear $L^1$ to $L^\infty$ bound. Consequentially, we prove polynomial upper and exponential lower bounds on the fundamental solution by adapting Aronson's method to non-local hypoelliptic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a direct method of establishing the existence and uniqueness of saddle-node bifurcations for nonlinear equations in general domains. The method employs the scaled extended quotient whose saddle points correspond to the saddle-node bifurcations. The uniqueness of the saddle-node bifurcation point directly stems from the uniqueness of the saddle point. The method is applied to solving open problems involving the existence and uniqueness of the maximum saddle-node bifurcation for the positive solutions curve to an elliptic boundary value problem with a convex-concave nonlinearity in general domains.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity of the free interface in spectral optimal partition problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal partition of a domain with respect to the sum of the principal eigenvalues and we prove for the first time regularity results for the free interface up to fixed boundary. All our results are quantitative and, in particular, we obtain fine estimates on the continuity of the solutions and the oscillation of the free interface (in terms of the modulus of continuity of the normal vector of the fixed boundary), even in the case of domains with low (Dini-type) regularity. Our analysis is based on an Almgren-type monotonicity formula at boundary points and an epiperimetric inequality at points of low frequency, which, together, yield an explicit rate of convergence for blow-up sequences and the boundary strong unique continuation property. Exploiting our quantitative blow-up analysis, we manage to prove clean-up results near one-phase and two-phase points. We define the notion of free interface inside the fixed boundary, and we prove that the subset of points of minimal frequency is regular and that the interior free interface is approaching the boundary orthogonally in a smooth way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability and minimizing properties of higher codimensional surfaces in Euclidean space associated with the $f$-weighted area-functional $$\mathcal{E}_f(M)=\int_M f(x)\; d \mathcal{H}_k$$ with the density function $f(x)=g(|x|)$ and $g(t)$ is non-negative, which develop the recent works by U. Dierkes and G. Huisken (Math. Ann., 20 October 2023) on hypersurfaces with the density function $|x|^\alpha$. Under suitable assumptions on $g(t)$, we prove that minimal cones with globally flat normal bundles are $f$-stable, and we also prove that the regular minimal cones satisfying Lawlor curvature criterion, the highly singular determinantal varieties and Pfaffian varieties without some exceptional cases are $f$-minimizing. As an application, we show that $k$-dimensional minimal cones over product of spheres are $|x|^\alpha$-stable for $\alpha\geq-k+2\sqrt{2(k-1)}$, the oriented stable minimal hypercones are $|x|^\alpha$-stable for $\alpha\geq 0$, and we also show that the minimal cones over product of spheres $\mathcal{C}=C \left(S^{k_1} \times \cdots \times S^{k_{m}}\right)$ are $|x|^\alpha$-minimizing for $\dim \mathcal{C} \geq 7$, $k_i&gt;1$ and $\alpha \geq 0$, the Simons cones $C(S^{p} \times S^{p})(p\geq 1)$ are $|x|^\alpha$-minimizing for any $\alpha \geq 1$, which relaxes the assumption $1\leq\alpha \leq 2p$ in \cite{DH23}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a pointwise fractional Hardy inequality implies a fractional Hardy inequality, defined via a Gagliardo-type seminorm. The proof consists of two main parts. The first one is to characterize the pointwise fractional Hardy inequality in terms of a fractional capacity density condition. The second part is to show the deep open-endedness or self-improvement property of the fractional capacity density, which we accomplish in the setting of a complete geodesic space equipped with a doubling measure. These results are new already in the standard Euclidean setting.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an $L^p$-spectral multiplier theorem for sub-Laplacians on Heisenberg type groups under the sharp regularity condition $s&gt;d\left|1/p-1/2\right|$, where $d$ is the topological dimension of the underlying group. Our approach relies on restriction type estimates where the multiplier is additionally truncated along the spectrum of the Laplacian on the center of the group.</description>

Abstract: Norm-resolvent convergence with order-sharp error estimate is established for Neumann Laplacians on thin domains in $\mathbb{R}^d,$ $d\ge2,$ converging to metric graphs in the limit of vanishing thickness parameter in the resonant case. The vertex matching conditions of the limiting quantum graph are revealed as being closely related to $\delta'$ type.</description>

      <title>A new notion of subharmonicity on locally smoothing spaces, and a conjecture by Braverman, Milatovic, Shubin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a strongly local Dirichlet space and $\lambda\geq 0$, we introduce a new notion of $\lambda$--subharmonicity for $L^1_\loc$--functions, which we call \emph{local $\lambda$--shift defectivity}, and which turns out to be equivalent to distributional $\lambda$--subharmonicity in the Riemannian case. We study the regularity of these functions on a new class of strongly local Dirichlet, so called locally smoothing spaces, which includes Riemannian manifolds (without any curvature assumptions), finite dimensional RCD spaces, Carnot groups, and Sierpinski gaskets. As a byproduct of this regularity theory, we obtain in this general framework a proof of a conjecture by Braverman, Milatovic, Shubin on the positivity of distributional $L^q$-solutions of $\Delta f\leq f$ for complete Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Majorana transformation makes it possible to reduce the Thomas-Fermi equation to a first-order differential equation. This reduction is possible due to the special scaling property of the Thomas-Fermi equation under homology transformations. Such reductions are well known in the context of stellar astrophysics, where the use of homology-invariant variables has long proved useful. We use homology-invariant variables in the context of the Thomas-Fermi equation to demystify the origin of the otherwise mysterious Majorana transformation.</description>

      <title>Remark on the local well-posedness of compressible non-Newtonian fluids with initial vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss in this short note the local-in-time strong well-posedness of the compressible Navier-Stokes system for non-Newtonian fluids on the three dimensional torus. We show that the result established recently by Kalousek, M\'{a}cha, and Ne\v{c}asova in \doi{10.1007/s00208-021-02301-8} can be extended to the case where vanishing density is allowed initially. Our proof builds on the framework developed by Cho, Choe, and Kim in \doi{10.1016/j.matpur.2003.11.004} for compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the case of Newtonian fluids. To adapt their method, special attention is given to the elliptic regularity of a challenging nonlinear elliptic system. We show particular results in this direction, however, the main result of this paper is proven in the general case when elliptic $W^{2,p}$-regularity is imposed as an assumption. Also, we give a finite time blow-up criterion.</description>

      <title>Persistence, extinction and spreading properties of non-cooperative Fisher--KPP systems in space-time periodic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with asymptotic persistence, extinction and spreading properties for non-cooperative Fisher-KPP systems with space-time periodic coefficients. Results are formulated in terms of a family of generalized principal eigenvalues associated with the linearized problem. When the maximal generalized principal eigenvalue is negative, all solutions to the Cauchy problem become locally uniformly positive in long-time, at least one space-time periodic uniformly positive entire solution exists, and solutions with compactly supported initial condition asymptotically spread in space at a speed given by a Freidlin-G{\"a}rtner-type formula. When another, possibly smaller, generalized principal eigenvalue is nonnegative, then on the contrary all solutions to the Cauchy problem vanish uniformly and the zero solution is the unique space-time periodic nonnegative entire solution. When the twogeneralized principal eigenvalues differ and zero is in between, the long-time behavior depends on the decay at infinity of the initial condition. The proofs rely upon double-sided controls by solutions of cooperative systems. The control from below is new for such systems and makes it possible to shorten the proofs and extend the generality of the system simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Spectral and linear stability of peakons in the Novikov equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06655v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Novikov equation is a peakon equation with cubic nonlinearity which, like the Camassa-Holm and the Degasperis-Procesi, is completely integrable. In this article, we study the spectral and linear stability of peakon solutions of the Novikov equation. We prove spectral instability of the peakons in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. To do so, we start with a linearized operator defined on $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ and extend it to a linearized operator defined on weaker functions in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. The spectrum of the linearized operator in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is proven to cover a closed vertical strip of the complex plane. Furthermore, we prove that the peakons are spectrally unstable on $W^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ and linearly and spectrally stable on $H^1(\mathbb{R})$. The result on $W^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ are in agreement with previous work about linear stability, while our results on $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ are in agreement with the orbital stability obtained previously.</description>

      <title>Large time asymptotics for partially dissipative hyperbolic systems without Fourier analysis: application to the nonlinearly damped p-system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new framework to obtain time-decay estimates for partially dissipative hyperbolic systems set on the real line is developed. Under the classical Shizuta-Kawashima (SK) stability condition, equivalent to the Kalman rank condition in control theory, the solutions of these systems decay exponentially in time for high frequencies and polynomially for low ones. This allows to derive a sharp description of the space-time decay of solutions for large time. However, such analysis relies heavily on the use of the Fourier transform that we avoid here, developing the "physical space version" of the hyperbolic hypocoercivity approach introduced by Beauchard and Zuazua, to prove new asymptotic results in the linear and nonlinear settings. The new physical space version of the hyperbolic hypocoercivity approach allows to recover the natural heat-like time-decay of solutions under sharp rank conditions, without employing Fourier analysis or $L^1$ assumptions on the initial data. Taking advantage of this Fourier-free framework, we establish new enhanced time-decay estimates for initial data belonging to weighted Sobolev spaces. These results are then applied to the nonlinear compressible Euler equations with linear damping. We also prove the logarithmic stability of the nonlinearly damped $p$-system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish generalised fractional boundary Hardy-type inequality, in the spirit of Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality for different values of $s$ and $p$ on various domains in $\mathbb{R}^d, ~ d \geq 1$. In particular, for Lipschitz bounded domains any values of $s$ and $p$ are admissible, settling all the cases in sub critical, super critical and critical regime. In this paper we have solved the open problems posed by Dyda for the critical case $sp =1$. Moreover we have proved the embeddings of $W^{s,p}(\Omega)$ in subcritical, critical and supercritical uniformly without using Dyda's decomposition. Additionally, we extend our results to include a weighted fractional boundary Hardy-type inequality for the critical case.</description>

      <title>Nonradial nondegeneracy and uniqueness of positive solutions to a class of fractional semilinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that positive solutions $u\in H^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to the equation $(-\Delta )^s u+ u=u^p$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ are nonradially nondegenerate, for all $s\in (0,1)$, $N\geq 1$ and $p&gt;1$ strictly smaller than the critical Sobolev exponent. By this we mean that the linearized equation $(-\Delta )^s w+ w-pu^{p-1}w = 0$ does not admit nonradial solutions beside the directional derivatives of $u$. Letting $B$ be the unit centered ball and $\lambda_1(B)$ the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta )^s$, we also prove that positive solutions to $(-\Delta )^s u+\lambda u=u^p$ in ${B}$ with $u=0$ on $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus B$, are nonradially nondegenerate for any $\lambda&gt; -\lambda_1(B)$ in the sense that the linearized equation does not admit nonradial solutions. From the latter result, we then deduce uniqueness and full nondegeneracy of positive solutions in the special case $N=1$ and $\lambda = 0$. Moreover, we deduce uniqueness of positive ground state solutions in the case $N=1$, $\lambda \ge 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of (global) maximal regularity for quasilinear evolution equations with sublinear gradient growth and right-hand side in Lebesgue spaces, complemented with Neumann boundary conditions. The proof relies on a suitable variation of the Bernstein technique and the Bochner identity, and provides new results even for the simpler parabolic $p$-Laplacian equation with unbounded source term. As a byproduct we also obtain a second-order estimate that can be of independent interest when the right-side of the equation belongs to $L^m$, $m\neq 2$. This approach leads to new results even for stationary problems.</description>

Abstract: In a series of previous works (arXiv:2104.11204, arXiv:2110.04565, arXiv:2301.07063), we gave a rigorous derivation of the homogeneous wave kinetic equation (WKE) up to small multiples of the kinetic timescale, which corresponds to short time solutions to the wave kinetic equation. In this work, we extend this justification to arbitrarily long times that cover the full lifespan of the WKE. This is the first large data, long-time derivation ever obtained in any nonlinear (particle or wave) collisional kinetic limit.</description>

      <title>The stability of smooth solitary waves for the $b$-family of Camassa-Holm equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $b$-family of Camassa-Holm ($b$-CH) equation is a one-parameter family of PDEs, which includes the completely integrable Camassa-Holm and Degasperis-Procesi equations but possesses different Hamiltonian structures. Motivated by this, we study the existence and the orbital stability of the smooth solitary wave solutions with nonzero constant background to the $b$-CH equation for the special case $b=1$, whose the Hamiltonian structure is different from that of $b\neq1$. We establish a connection between the stability criterion for the solitary waves and the monotonicity of a singular integral along the corresponding homoclinic orbits of the spatial ODEs. We verify the latter analytically using the framework for the monotonicity of period function of planar Hamiltonian systems, which shows that the smooth solitary waves are orbitally stable. In addition, we find that the existence and orbital stability results for $0&lt;b&lt;1$ are similar to that of $b&gt;1$, particularly the stability criteria are the same. Finally, combining with the results for the case $b&gt;1$, we conclude that the solitary waves to the $b$-CH equation is structurally stable under the variation of %with respect to the parameter $b&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Semilinear damped wave equations on the Heisenberg group with initial data from Sobolev spaces of negative order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on studying the Cauchy problem for semilinear damped wave equations involving the sub-Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$ on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$ with power type nonlinearity $|u|^p$ and initial data taken from Sobolev spaces of negative order homogeneous Sobolev space $\dot H^{-\gamma}_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{H}^n), \gamma&gt;0$, on $\mathbb{H}^n$. In particular, in the framework of Sobolev spaces of negative order, we prove that the critical exponent is the exponent $p_{\text{crit}}(Q, \gamma)=1+\frac{4}{Q+2\gamma},$ for some $\gamma\in (0, \frac{Q}{2})$, where $Q:=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{H}^n$. More precisely, we establish a global-in-time existence of small data Sobolev solutions of lower regularity for $p&gt;p_{\text{crit}}(Q, \gamma)$ in the energy evolution space; a finite time blow-up of weak solutions for $1&lt;p&lt;p_{\text{crit}}(Q, \gamma)$ under certain conditions on the initial data by using the test function method. Furthermore, to precisely characterize the blow-up time, we derive sharp upper bound and lower bound estimates for the lifespan in the subcritical case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the narrow escape problem in the disk, which consists in identifying the first exit time and first exit point distribution of a Brownian particle from the ball in dimension 2, with reflecting boundary conditions except on small disjoint windows through which it can escape. This problem is motivated by practical questions arising in various scientific fields (in particular cellular biology and molecular dynamics). We apply the quasi-stationary distribution approach to metastability, which requires to study the eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the small absorbing part of the boundary, and Neumann boundary conditions on the remaining reflecting part. We obtain rigorous asymptotic estimates of the first eigenvalue and of the normal derivative of the associated eigenfunction in the limit of infinitely small exit regions, which yield asymptotic estimates of the first exit time and first exit point distribution starting from the quasi-stationary distribution within the disk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new results for general weak solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the three-dimensional torus, without using the strong energy inequality or other regularity assumptions. Specifically, we prove two types of differential energy equalities, in which $(d/dt)\lVert u\rVert^2$ is replaced by $2\langle \partial_t u,u\rangle$ and $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}(d/dt)\lVert u_N\rVert^2$, where the $u_N$ are projections of the original weak solution $u$. We also provide a new characterization of Leray-Hopf solutions, as weak solutions having a version for which the energy is monotonically decreasing. In order to prove these results, we first prove that both $\partial_t u$ and $\Delta u$ are in $L^{4/3}(\epsilon, T; L^{6/5})$, results that were previously known only for Leray-Hopf weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Existence results for Cahn-Hilliard type systems driven by nonlocal integrodifferential operators with singular kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a fractional variant of the Cahn-Hilliard equation settled in a bounded domain and with a possibly singular potential. We first focus on the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, and show how to prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution. The proof relies on the variational method known as \textit{minimizing-movements scheme}, which fits naturally with the gradient-flow structure of the equation. The interest of the proposed method lies in its extreme generality and flexibility. In particular, relying on the variational structure of the equation, we prove the existence of a solution for a general class of integrodifferential operators, not necessarily linear or symmetric, which include fractional versions of the $q$-Laplacian. In the second part of the paper, we adapt the argument in order to prove the existence of solutions in the case of regional fractional operators. As a byproduct, this yields an existence result in the interesting cases of homogeneous fractional Neumann boundary conditions or periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Revivals, or the Talbot effect, for the Airy equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Dirichlet-type problems for the simplest third-order linear dispersive PDE, often referred to as the Airy equation. Such problems have not been extensively studied, perhaps due to the complexity of the spectral structure of the spatial operator. Our specific interest is to determine whether the peculiar phenomenon of revivals, also known as Talbot effect, is supported by these boundary conditions, which for third order problems are not reducible to periodic ones. We prove that this is the case only for a very special choice of the boundary conditions, for which a new type of weak cusp revival phenomenon has been recently discovered. We also give some new results on the functional class of the solution for other cases.</description>

      <title>A poroelastic plate model obtained by simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the starting point of our analysis is \ a coupled system of linear elasticity and Stokes equation. We consider two small parameters: the thickness $h$ of the thin plate and the pore scale $\varepsilon(h)$ which depends on $h$. We will focus specifically on the case when the pore size is comparatively small relative to the thickness of the plate. The main goal here is derive a model of a poroelastic plate, starting from the $3D$ problem as $h$ goes to zero, using simultaneous homogenization and dimension reduction techniques. The obtained model generalizes the poroelastic plate model derived by A. Mikeli\'c et. al. in 2015 using dimension reduction techniques from $3D$ Biot's equations in the sense that it also covers the case of contact of poroelastic and elastic plate as well as the evolution equation with inertial term.</description>

      <title>Self-dual solution of 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations will have a global smooth solution for all smooth, finite energy initial data is a Millennium Prize problem. One of the main difficulties of this problem is that the Navier-Stokes equations are actually a system of semilinear heat equations rather than a single equation. In this paper, we discover a remarkable hidden symmetry of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Under this symmetric reduction, the system reduces to a single scalar semilinear heat equation. The symmetry also holds for the 3D incompressible Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations: regularity, existence and uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish embeddings {\`a} la Lions and transfer of regularity {\`a} la Bouchut for a large scale of kinetic spaces. We use them to identify a notion of weak solutions to Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations with (local or integral) diffusion and rough (measurable) coefficients under minimal requirements. We prove their existence and uniqueness for a large class of source terms, first in full space for the time, position and velocity variables and then for the kinetic Cauchy problem on infinite and finite time intervals.</description>

      <title>A new proof for the existence of rotationally symmetric gradient Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.03805v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof for the existence of rotationally symmetric steady and expanding gradient Ricci solitons in dimension $n+1$, $2\le n\le 4$, with metric $g=\frac{da^2}{h(a^2)}+a^2d\,\sigma$ for some function $h$ where $d\sigma$ is the standard metric on the unit sphere $S^n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. More precisely for any $\lambda\ge 0$, $2\le n\le 4$ and $\mu_1\in\mathbb{R}$, we prove the existence of unique solution $h\in C^2((0,\infty))\cap C^1([0,\infty))$ for the equation $2r^2h(r)h_{rr}(r)=(n-1)h(r)(h(r)-1)+rh_r(r)(rh_r(r)-\lambda r-(n-1))$, $h(r)&gt;0$, in $(0,\infty)$ satisfying $h(0)=1$, $h_r(0)=\mu_1$. We also prove the existence of unique analytic solution of the about equation on $[0,\infty)$ for any $\lambda\ge 0$, $n\ge 2$ and $\mu_1\in\mathbb{R}$. Moreover we will prove the asymptotic behaviour of the solution $h$ for any $n\ge 2$, $\lambda\ge 0$ and $\mu_1\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$.</description>

      <title>Pseudodifferential Models for Ultrasound Waves with Fractional Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To strike a balance between modeling accuracy and computational efficiency for simulations of ultrasound waves in soft tissues, we derive a pseudodifferential factorization of the wave operator with fractional attenuation. This factorization allows us to approximately solve the Helmholtz equation via one-way (transmission) or two-way (transmission and reflection) sweeping schemes tailored to high-frequency wave fields. We provide explicitly the three highest order terms of the pseudodifferential expansion to incorporate the well-known square-root first order symbol for wave propagation, the zeroth order symbol for amplitude modulation due to changes in wave speed and damping, and the next symbol to model fractional attenuation. We also propose wide-angle Pade approximations for the pseudodifferential operators corresponding to these three highest order symbols. Our analysis provides insights regarding the role played by the frequency and the Pade approximations in the estimation of error bounds. We also provide a proof-of-concept numerical implementation of the proposed method and test the error estimates numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we compare in detail the linear and nonlinear approach to the Gravitational Waves Displacement and Velocity Memory (GWDM and GWVM) effects. We consider astrophysical situations that give rise to gravitational waves with GWVM effect, i.e. with a residual velocity (the so-called "velocity-coded memory") and discuss the possibility of future detection of the GWVM effect.</description>

      <title>Locally constrained flows and geometric inequalities in sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we uncover an intriguing algebra property of an element symmetric polynomial. By this property, we establish the longtime existence and convergence of a locally constrained flow, thereby some families of geometric inequalities in sphere can be derived. Meanwhile, a new family of ``three terms'' geometric inequalities involving two weighted curvature integrals and one quermassintegral are proved. Unlike hyperbolic spaces, we also obtain an inverse weighted geometric inequality in sphere.</description>
