      <title>Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): Dynamical Evidence of a Spiral-Arm-Driving and Gap-Opening Protoplanet from SAO 206462 Spiral Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early stages of planetary system formation, young exoplanets gravitationally interact with their surrounding environments and leave observable signatures on protoplanetary disks. Among these structures, a pair of nearly symmetric spiral arms can be driven by a giant protoplanet. For the double-spiraled SAO 206462 protoplanetary disk, we obtained three epochs of observations spanning 7 yr using the Very Large Telescope's SPHERE instrument in near-infrared $J$-band polarized light. By jointly measuring the motion of the two spirals at three epochs, we obtained a rotation rate of $-0.85^\circ\pm0.05^\circ~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This rate corresponds to a protoplanet at $66\pm3$ au on a circular orbit dynamically driving both spirals. The derived location agrees with the gap in ALMA dust-continuum observations, indicating that the spiral driver may also carve the observed gap. What is more, a dust filament at $\sim$63 au observed by ALMA coincides with the predicted orbit of the spiral-arm-driving protoplanet. This double-spiraled system is an ideal target for protoplanet imaging.</description>

      <title>Enhanced detection and identification of satellites using an all-sky multi-frequency survey with prototype SKA-Low stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the low Earth orbit environment becoming increasingly populated with artificial satellites, rockets, and debris, it is important to understand the effects they have on radio astronomy. In this work, we undertake a multi-frequency, multi-epoch survey with two SKA-Low station prototypes located at the SKA-Low site, to identify and characterise radio frequency emission from orbiting objects and consider their impact on radio astronomy observations. We identified 152 unique satellites across multiple passes in low and medium Earth orbits from 1.6 million full-sky images across 13 selected ${\approx}1$ MHz frequency bands in the SKA-Low frequency range, acquired over almost 20 days of data collection. Our algorithms significantly reduce the rate of satellite misidentification, compared to previous work, validated through simulations to be $&lt;1\%$. Notably, multiple satellites were detected transmitting unintended electromagnetic radiation, as well as several decommissioned satellites likely transmitting when the Sun illuminates their solar panels. We test alternative methods of processing data, which will be deployed for a larger, more systematic survey at SKA-Low frequencies in the near future. The current work establishes a baseline for monitoring satellite transmissions, which will be repeated in future years to assess their evolving impact on radio astronomy observations.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from the detection of wide companions by radial velocity and astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and constraint of the orbits of long-period giant planets is essential for enabling their further study through direct imaging. Recently, Venner et al. (2024) highlighted discrepancies between the solutions presented by Feng et al. (2022) and those from other studies, which primarily use orvara. We address these concerns by reanalyzing the data for HD 28185, GJ 229, HD 211847, GJ 680, HD 111031, and eps Ind A, offering explanations for these discrepancies. Based on a comparison between the methods used by Feng et al. (2022) and orvara, we find the discrepancies are primarily data-related rather than methodology-related. Our re-analysis of HD 28185 highlights many of the data-related issues and particularly the importance of parallax modeling for year-long companions. The case of eps Ind A b is instructive to emphasize the value of an extended RV baseline for accurately determining orbits of long period companions. Our orbital solutions highlight other causes for discrepancies between solutions including the combination of absolute and relative astrometry, clear definitions of conventions, and efficient posterior sampling for the detection of wide-orbit giant planets.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the origin of the broken misaligned circumtriple disk around GW Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the origin of the observed misaligned rings in the circumtriple disk around GW Ori. Previous studies appeared to disagree on whether disk breaking is caused by the differential precession driven in the disk by the triple star system. In this letter, we show that the previous studies are in agreement with each other when using the same set of parameters. But for observationally motivated parameters of a typical protoplanetary disk, the disk is unlikely to break due to interactions with the triple star system. We run 3-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a circumtriple disk around GW Ori with different disk aspect ratios. For a disk aspect ratio typical of protoplanetary disks, $H/r \gtrsim 0.05$, the disk does not break. An alternative scenario for the gap's origin consistent with the expected disk aspect ratio involves the presence of giant circumtriple planets orbiting GW Ori.</description>

      <title>Influence of ICME-driven Magnetic Cloud-like and Sheath Region induced Geomagnetic Storms in causing anomalous responses of the Low-latitude Ionosphere: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows an anomalously enhanced response of the low-latitude ionosphere over the Indian sector under weak geomagnetic conditions (October 31, 2021) in comparison to a stronger event (November 04, 2021) under the influence of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME)-driven Magnetic Cloud (MC)-like and sheath regions respectively. The investigation is based on measurements of the Total Electron Content (TEC) from Ahmedabad (23.06$^\circ$N, 72.54$^\circ$E, geographic; dip angle: 35.20$^\circ$), a location near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) over the Indian region. During the weaker event, the observed TEC from the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites of Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), showed diurnal maximum enhancements of about 20 TECU over quiet-time variations, as compared to the stronger event where no such enhancements are present. It is shown that storm intensity (SYM-H) or magnitude of the southward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) alone is unable to determine the ionospheric impacts of this space weather event. However, it is the non-fluctuating southward IMF and the corresponding penetration electric fields, for a sufficient interval of time, in tandem with the poleward neutral wind variations, that determines the strengthening of low-latitude electrodynamics of this anomalous event of October 31, 2021. Therefore, the present investigation highlights a case for further investigations of the important roles played by non-fluctuating penetration electric fields in determining a higher response of the low-latitude ionosphere even if the geomagnetic storm intensities are significantly low.</description>

      <title>Milestones at the Origin of Life</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living organisms have some common structures, chemical reactions and molecular structures. The organisms consist of cells with cell division, they have homochirality of protein and carbohydrate units, and metabolism, and genetics, and they are mortal. The molecular structures and chemical reactions underlying these features are common from the simplest bacteria to human beings. The origin of life is evolutionary with the emergence of a network of spontaneous biochemical reactions, and the evolution has taken place over a very long time. The evolution contains, however some "landmarks" and bottlenecks, which in a revolutionary manner directed the evolution, and the article tries to establish the order of these events. The article advocates that a possible order in the emergence of life is that the first milestone in prebiotic evolution is at the emergence of homochirality in proteins. The homochirality of peptides is, however, with instability and racemization which causes aging of the peptides and mortality. The metabolism and genetics are established through homochiral enzymes in the Earth's crust for $\approx$ 4 Gyr ago. Finally, the cells with cell division are established in the Hot Springs environment at the interface between the crust and the Hadean Ocean.</description>

      <title>Spin-down of solar-mass protostars in magnetospheric accretion paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar spin is one of the fundamental quantities that characterize a star itself and its planetary system. Nevertheless, stellar spin-down mechanisms in protostellar and pre-main-sequence stellar phases have been a long-standing problem in the star formation theory. To realize the spin-down, previous axisymmetric models based on the conventional magnetospheric paradigm have to assume massive stellar winds or produce highly time-variable magnetospheric ejections. However, this picture has been challenged by both numerical simulations and observations. With a particular focus on the propeller regime for solar-mass stars, we propose a new picture of stellar spin-down based on our recent three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulation and stellar evolution calculation. We show that failed magnetospheric winds, unique to 3D models, significantly reduce the spin-up accretion torque, which make it easier for the star to spin-down. Additionally, the amplitude of time variability associated with magnetospheric ejections is reduced by 3D effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the star spins down by generating a conical disk wind, driven by a rotating stellar magnetosphere. Our theoretical estimates, inspired by the numerical model, suggest that the conical disk wind is likely to play a crucial role in extracting stellar angular momentum during the protostellar phase. As magnetospheric accretion is expected to occur in other accreting objects such as proto-giant planets, this study will also contribute to the understanding of the angular momentum of such objects.</description>

      <title>Geomagnetic dipole stability and zonal flows controlled by mantle heat flux heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims at acquiring a more complete understanding of how lateral heterogeneities of the CMB heat flux affect the geodynamo while other relevant parameters are pushed towards realistic values. For this purpose, we ran geodynamo simulations with degree 1 and 2 spherical harmonic patterns of heat flux at the CMB. Several geodynamo models are used, ranging from standard numerical dynamos to more extreme parameters, including strong field cases and turbulent cases. We show that heat flux heterogeneities with amplitudes compatible with our knowledge of mantle convection history can favour multipolar dynamos. The multipolar transition is associated with a disruption of westward flows either through eastward thermal winds or through a loss of equatorial symmetry. Strong field dynamo models are found to have larger westward flows and are less sensitive to heat flux heterogeneities. Furthermore, we find that the dipolar fraction of the magnetic field correlates with $M_{Za}^*=\dfrac{\Lambda_{Za}}{Rm_{Za}^2}$ where $\Lambda_{Za}$ is the zonal antisymmetric Elsasser number and $Rm_{Za}$ is the zonal antisymmetric magnetic Reynolds number. Importantly, $M_{Za}^*$ estimated for the Earth's core is consistent with a reversing dipolar magnetic field. Within the range of $M_{Za}^*$ susceptible to reversals, breaking the equatorial symmetry or forcing eastward zonal flows through an equatorial cooling of the core consistently triggers reversals or a transition towards multipolar dynamos in our simulations. Our results support that time variations of heat-flux heterogeneities driven by mantle convection through Earth's history are capable of inducing the significant variations in the reversal frequency observed in the palaeomagnetic record.</description>

      <title>Short-Term Evolution and Risks of Debris Cloud Stemming from Collisions in Geostationary Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing population of objects in geostationary orbit has raised concerns about the potential risks posed by debris clouds resulting from fragmentation. The short-term evolution and associated hazards of debris generated by collisions in the geostationary region is investigated in this study. The initial distribution of two debris clouds is modeled using a single probability density function. The combined distribution of the evolved clouds is determined by solving boundary value problems. The risks associated with these debris clouds are evaluated by calculating the instantaneous impact rate and cumulative collision probability. The probability of collisions with millimeter-sized fragments may increase to 1% within 36 hours, while the probability of collisions with fragments 5 cm or larger is approximately $10^{-5}$. These findings underscore the vulnerability of the geostationary region to space traffic accidents.</description>

Abstract: We study the effect of dark matter annihilation on the formation of Jovian planets. We show that dark matter heat injections can slow or halt Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, preventing the accretion of hydrogen and helium onto the solid core. The existence of Jupiter in our solar system can therefore be used to infer constraints on dark matter with relatively strong interaction cross sections. We derive novel constraints on the cross section for both spin-dependent and spin-independent dark matter. We highlight the possibility of a positive detection using future observations by JWST, which could reveal strongly varying planet morpholoiges close to our Galactic Center.</description>

      <title>Training Datasets Generation for Machine Learning: Application to Vision Based Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Based Navigation consists in utilizing cameras as precision sensors for GNC after extracting information from images. To enable the adoption of machine learning for space applications, one of obstacles is the demonstration that available training datasets are adequate to validate the algorithms. The objective of the study is to generate datasets of images and metadata suitable for training machine learning algorithms. Two use cases were selected and a robust methodology was developed to validate the datasets including the ground truth. The first use case is in-orbit rendezvous with a man-made object: a mockup of satellite ENVISAT. The second use case is a Lunar landing scenario. Datasets were produced from archival datasets (Chang'e 3), from the laboratory at DLR TRON facility and at Airbus Robotic laboratory, from SurRender software high fidelity image simulator using Model Capture and from Generative Adversarial Networks. The use case definition included the selection of algorithms as benchmark: an AI-based pose estimation algorithm and a dense optical flow algorithm were selected. Eventually it is demonstrated that datasets produced with SurRender and selected laboratory facilities are adequate to train machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Decline and Fall of ROME. V. A Preliminary Search for Star-Disrupted Planet Interactions and Coronal Activity at 5 GHz Among White Dwarfs within 25 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of planetesimals orbiting white dwarfs has renewed interest in the final chapters of the evolution of planetary systems. Although observational and theoretical studies have examined the dynamical evolution of these systems, studies of their magnetic star-planet interactions, as powered by unipolar induction, have thus far only been assessed theoretically. This fifth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted mini-survey of nine white dwarfs within 25 pc without known stellar mass companions in search of radio emissions generated by magnetic interactions between white dwarfs and their planetary remnants. This $\sim$5 GHz Arecibo radio telescope survey achieved mJy-level sensitivity over $&lt;$1 s integration times. Although no exoplanet-induced stellar radio flares were detected, this is the first survey to search for magnetic star-planet interactions between white dwarfs and planetary companions, cores, or disrupted planetesimals. It is also the most extensive and sensitive radio survey for intrinsic coronal emissions from apparently isolated white dwarfs. The study of radio emissions from white dwarf systems may present a new means to detect and measure DC and DQ magnetic fields, search for white dwarf coronae, characterize the density and spatial distribution of white dwarf magnetospheric plasma, characterize the dynamical and electrical properties of planetary cores, and offer new constraints on the modeling of double degenerate merger events.</description>
