      <title>Excitation of whistler and slow-X waves by runaway electrons in a collisional plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway electrons are known to provide robust ideal or collisionless
  kinetic drive for plasma wave instabilities in both the whistler and
  slow-X branches, via the anomalous Doppler-shifted cyclotron
  resonances. In a cold and dense post-thermal-quench plasma,
  collisional damping of the plasma waves can be competitive with the
  collisionless drive. Previous studies have found that for its higher
  wavelength and frequency, slow-X waves suffer stronger collisional
  damping than the whistlers, while the ideal growth rate of slow-X
  modes is higher. Here we study runaway avalanche distributions that maintain the same eigen distribution and increase only in magnitude over time. The distributions are computed from the
  relativistic Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann solver, upon which a linear
  dispersion analysis is performed to search for the most unstable or
  least damped slow-X and whistler modes. Taking into account the
  effect of plasma density, plasma temperature, and effective charge
  number, we find that the slow-X modes tend to be excited before the
  whistlers in a runaway current ramp-up. Furthermore, even when the
  runaway current density is sufficiently high that both branches are
  excited, the most unstable slow-X mode has much higher growth rate
  than the most unstable whistler mode. The qualitative and
  quantitative trends uncovered in current study indicate that even
  though past experiments and modeling efforts have concentrated on whistler modes, there's a compelling case that slow-X modes should also be a key area of focus.</description>

      <title>Impact of model uncertainty on SPARC operating scenario predictions with empirical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and accounting for uncertainty helps to ensure next-step tokamaks such as SPARC will robustly achieve their goals. While traditional Plasma OPerating CONtour (POPCON) analyses guide design, they often overlook the significant impact of uncertainties in scaling laws, plasma profiles, and impurity concentrations on performance predictions. This work confronts these challenges by introducing statistical POPCONs, which leverage Monte Carlo analysis to quantify the sensitivity of SPARC's operating points [1] to these crucial variables. For profiles, a physically motivated gradient-based functional form is introduced. We further develop a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization workflow that effectively identifies operating points maximizing the probability of meeting performance goals, which gives a significant speed-up over brute force methods. Our findings reveal that accounting for these uncertainties leads to an optimal operating point different from deterministic predictions, which balances H-mode access, confinement, impurity dilution, and auxiliary power.</description>

      <title>Speed-dependent Threshold for Electron Injection into Diffusive Shock Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the injection threshold for diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of electrons in collisionless shocks has been a longstanding unsolved problem. Using first-principles kinetic simulations, we identify the conditions for electron injection into DSA and quantify the evolution of the nonthermal tail in self-generated electromagnetic turbulence. By analyzing electron trajectories and their momentum gain during shock-recrossing cycles, we demonstrate that electrons start participating in DSA when their speed is large enough to overrun the shock. We develop a minimal model showing that speed-dependent injection reproduces nonthermal electron spectra observed in kinetic simulations. Our findings establish a new criterion for electron DSA, which has broad implications for the nonthermal emission of shock-powered space/astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Surrogate models to optimize plasma assisted atomic layer deposition in high aspect ratio features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore surrogate models to optimize plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) in high aspect ratio features. In plasma-based processes such as PEALD and atomic layer etching, surface recombination can dominate the reactivity of plasma species with the surface, which can lead to unfeasibly long exposure times to achieve full conformality inside nanostructures like high aspect ratio vias. Using a synthetic dataset based on simulations of PEALD, we train artificial neural networks to predict saturation times based on cross section thickness data obtained for partially coated conditions. The results obtained show that just two experiments in undersaturated conditions contain enough information to predict saturation times within 10% of the ground truth. A surrogate model trained to determine whether surface recombination dominates the plasma-surface interactions in a PEALD process achieves 99% accuracy. This demonstrates that machine learning can provide a new pathway to accelerate the optimization of PEALD processes in areas such as microelectronics. Our approach can be easily extended to atomic layer etching and more complex structures.</description>

      <title>Metriplectic relaxation to equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metriplectic dynamical systems consist of a special combination of a Hamiltonian and a (generalized) entropy-gradient flow, such that the Hamiltonian is conserved and entropy is dissipated/produced (depending on a sign convention). It is natural to expect that, in the long-time limit, the orbit of a metriplectic system should converge to an extremum of entropy restricted to a constant-Hamiltonian surface. In this paper, we discuss sufficient conditions for this to occur, and construct a class of metriplectic systems that satisfy one such condition. The proposed metriplectic structure is inspired by the Landau operator for Coulomb collisions in plasmas, which is included as special case. We apply these results to the construction of relaxation methods for the solution of equilibrium problems in fluid dynamics and plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Effective resistivity for magnetohydrodynamic simulation of collisionless magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electron inertia term and the off-diagonal electron pressure terms are well-known for the frozen-in condition breakdown in collisionless magnetic reconnection, which are naturally kinetic and difficult to be employed in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. After considering the shortcomings of MHD and Hall MHD in neglecting the important electron dynamics such as the inertia and the nongyrotropic pressure, the kinetic characteristics of electrons and ions in the diffusion region are studied and an effective resistivity model involving dynamics of charged particles is proposed [Z. W. Ma et al. 2018 Sci. Rep. 8 10521]. The amplitude of the effective resistivity is mainly determined by electrons in most realistic situations with large ion-electron mass ratios. In this work, the effective resistivity model for collisionless magnetic reconnection without the guide field is successfully applied in the 2.5D MHD and Hall MHD simulations, which remarkably improves the simulation results compared with traditional MHD models. For the MHD case, the effective resistivity significantly increased the reconnection rate to the reasonable value of ~0.1$B_0v_A$. For the Hall MHD case with effective resistivity, the peak reconnection rate is ~0.25$B_0v_A$, and the major structures of the reconnecting field and the current sheet agree well with the particle-in-cell (PIC) and hybrid simulations.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional modelling of the interaction between electromagnetic waves and plasma-metamaterial composite structures using the particle-in-cell method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we (i) extend previous 1D studies of electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation in an over-dense plasma-metamaterial composite into two spatial dimensions and (ii) study blocking of EM waves by the composite 2D structures (barriers). Such barriers are formed when metamaterial spatially co-exists with a plasma density depletion in a form of a slab or two-dimensional density rectangular depletions (DRDs). This is analogous to EM wave trapping by preformed density cavities in near-critical density plasmas, studied before. We find that plasma-metamaterial composite allows to block EM waves by both slab and DRD configurations, thus forming a standing wave at the edge of an opaque region. The standing wave subsequently damps which offers applications such as heat deposition or substrate materials (micro)machining depending on EM wave intensity. The established results may find future applications such as: more efficient plasma vapour deposition, controlling EM wave propagation (EM wave blocking) in invisibility cloaks and alike. The EM wave blocking conditions are elucidated by a set of particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Reducing turbulent transport in tokamaks by combining intrinsic rotation and the low momentum diffusivity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the analysis of a large number of high-fidelity nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, we propose a novel strategy to improve confinement in spherical tokamak plasmas by combining up-down asymmetric flux surface shaping with the Low Momentum Diffusivity (LMD) regime. We show that the intrinsic momentum flux driven by up-down asymmetry creates strong flow shear in the LMD regime that can significantly reduce energy transport, increasing the critical gradient by up to $25\%$. In contrast to traditional methods for generating flow shear, such as neutral beam injection, this approach requires no external momentum source and is expected to scale well to large fusion devices. The experimental applicability of this strategy in spherical tokamaks is addressed via simulations by considering actual equilibria from MAST and a preliminary equilibrium from SMART.</description>

      <title>The effect of plasmoid drifts on the pellet rocket effect in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We detail here a semi-analytical model for the pellet rocket effect, which describes the acceleration of pellets in a fusion plasma due to asymmetries in the heat flux reaching the pellet surface and the corresponding ablation rate. This effect was shown in experiments to significantly modify the pellet trajectory, and projections for reactor scale devices indicate that it may severely limit the effectiveness of pellet injection methods. We account for asymmetries stemming both from plasma parameter gradients and an asymmetric plasmoid shielding caused by the drift of the ionized pellet cloud. For high temperature, reactor relevant scenarios, we find a wide range of initial pellet sizes and speeds where the rocket effect severely limits the penetration depth of the pellet. In these cases, the plasma parameter profile variations dominate the rocket effect. We find that for small and fast pellets, where the rocket effect is less pronounced, plasmoid shielding induced asymmetries dominate.</description>

      <title>The effect of plasma expansion on the dispersion properties of MHD waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we employ the set of ideal expanding magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations within the Expanding Box Model (EBM) framework to theoretically characterize the effects of radial solar wind expansion on its characteristic linear MHD waves. Through the analytical derivation of dispersion relations by a first-order expansion of the MHD-EBM equations, we explore the changes in wave propagation across a range of heliocentric distances on the linear magnetohydrodynamic modes: the Alfv\'en mode and the fast and slow magnetosonic modes, as obtained from the ideal MHD-EBM equations. Our findings reveal a spatial dependence in the derived dispersion relations that aligns with both the literature and the traditional ideal MHD case in the non-expanding limit, thereby helping to bridge the gap between theory and observation in solar wind dynamics. We observe a general decrease in wave frequencies as the plasma expands farther from the Sun. This decrease is reflected in the dispersion relations through the radial decrease of both the Alfv\'en and sound speeds, which decrease proportionally to $1/R$ and $1/R^{\gamma - 1}$, respectively, where $\gamma$ is the plasma polytropic index. The fast magnetosonic mode frequency and phase speed are significantly affected by the polytropic index value. We consider three models for the polytropic index evolution in the expanding solar wind: a constant (quasi-adiabatic) case, a radially decreasing profile in the outer heliosphere, and a model incorporating thermodynamic heating effects. Notably, we find that in the case of a decreasing polytropic index, the fast magnetosonic mode experiences an acceleration in the distant heliosphere, highlighting the significant influence of expansion on solar wind dynamics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the blowout plasma wakefields produced by drive beams with elliptical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the underdense (blowout) regime of plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), the particle beam is denser than the plasma. Under these conditions, the plasma electrons are nearly completely rarefacted from the beam channel, resulting in a nominally uniform ion column. Extensive investigations of this interaction assuming axisymmetry have been undertaken. However, the plasma blowout produced by a transversely asymmetric driver possesses quite different characteristics. They create an asymmetric plasma rarefaction region (bubble) which leads to asymmetric focusing in the two transverse planes. This is also accompanied by an undesired non-uniform accelerating gradient. The asymmetric blowout cross-section is found through simulation to be elliptical, and treating it as such permits a simple extension of the symmetric theory. In particular, focusing fields linear in both transverse directions exist in the bubble. The form of the wake potential and the concomitant matching conditions in this elliptical cavity are discussed in this paper. We also discuss bubble boundary estimation in the long driver limit and applications of the asymmetric features of the wakefield.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological rate formulas for over-barrier ionization of hydrogen and helium atoms in strong constant electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonrelativistic over-barrier ionization (OBI) of atoms in strong electric fields is studied, focussing on hydrogen and helium as concrete examples. Our goal is, on the one hand, to develop an intuitive physical picture behind established empirical formulas for the ionization rate. We show that the ionization rate in a near OBI regime can be modelled quantitatively by extending corresponding tunneling rates by the combined action of the Stark effect and a widened electron emission angle. On the other hand, we present analytical rate formulas in a far OBI regime which closely agree with available numerical data. In result, compact rate expressions describing OBI of hydrogen-like and helium atoms in a broad range of applied field strengths are obtained. They can be useful, for example, in numerical laser-plasma simulation codes to describe elementary ionization events.</description>
