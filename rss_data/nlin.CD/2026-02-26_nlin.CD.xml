      <title>Superpositions between non linear intermittency maps, application in biological neurons networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of works of ours we have shown that we can represent the critical and tricritical points of the Statistical Physics of critical phenomena as a Dynamical phenomenon expressed by time series produced by the type I intermittency that exhibits a weak chaos. Recently we have also shown that if we couple these two chaotic dynamics, namely critical and tricritical, we can produce a time sequence which is a temporal Spike Train (ST) of biological-type . In the present work we generalize this issue producing superpositions of critical-tricritical intermittencies with different parameter values. Now arise the question whether the coupling occurs between time series that have resulted from the superposition, will preserved or destroyed the ST biological type , as the number of intermittencies in the superposition will increase? In the other side in present work we find that the spikes produced by the chaotic dynamics of the intermittencies, under the action of superpositions and coupling remain biological-type too. Thus we can say that the dynamics of the fluctuations of the values of the time series produced by the coupling of the superpositions of the intermittencies is the same as the dynamics of the fluctuations of the membrane potential of the biological neuron. Given also that we can manipulate the numerical experiment of superposition and coupling as we wish, we will be able, in future, to approach the cause of neurological problems and decline in thinking ability due to loss of spikes in the brain.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Dense Active Fluids: Turbulence-Like States and the Role of Advected Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense suspensions of self-propelled bacteria and related active fluids exhibit spontaneous flow generation, vortex formation, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics despite operating at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers. These phenomena, commonly referred to as active turbulence, display striking visual and statistical similarities to classical inertial turbulence while arising from fundamentally different nonequilibrium mechanisms. In this article, we present a combined review and theoretical study of hydrodynamic models for dense active fluids, with particular emphasis on bacterial suspensions described by the Toner--Tu--Swift--Hohenberg (TTSH) framework. We review key experimental and theoretical developments underlying the analogy between active and inertial turbulence, highlighting the emergence of multiple dynamical regimes and the conditions under which universal spectral and intermittent behavior arises in homogeneous systems. Moving beyond the conventional assumption of spatially uniform activity, we introduce a minimal model in which the activity field is heterogeneous and dynamically advected by the flow it generates. Thus treating activity as a spatiotemporally evolving field coupled to the TTSH dynamics, we investigate how advection and diffusion lead to sharp activity fronts, confinement of turbulent motion, and complex interfacial morphologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that spatial variations in activity can induce transient coexistence of distinct spectral regimes and that universality in active turbulence is inherently local and time-dependent in heterogeneous systems. These findings underscore the importance of treating activity as a dynamical field in its own right and provide a framework for studying active turbulence in more realistic, spatially structured biological and synthetic active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Quantum Data Distribution via Chaotic Quantum Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models for quantum data pose significant challenges but hold immense potential in fields such as chemoinformatics and quantum physics. Quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models (QuDDPMs) enable efficient learning of quantum data distributions by progressively scrambling and denoising quantum states; however, existing implementations typically rely on circuit-based random unitary dynamics that can be costly to realize and sensitive to control imperfections, particularly on analog quantum hardware. We propose the chaotic quantum diffusion model, a framework that generates projected ensembles via chaotic Hamiltonian time evolution, providing a flexible and hardware-compatible diffusion mechanism. Requiring only global, time-independent control, our approach substantially reduces implementation overhead across diverse analog quantum platforms while achieving accuracy comparable to QuDDPMs. This method improves trainability and robustness, broadening the applicability of quantum generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Universality of stochastic control of quantum chaos with measurement and feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal features of measurement-and-feedback control of quantum chaotic dynamics by examining the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos. Inspired by probabilistic control of classical chaos, our protocol stochastically alternates between intrinsic instability and engineered control operations that steer trajectories toward a target point. Simulation of exact quantum dynamics and a semiclassical truncated Wigner approximation reveal universal properties of the cat map's control transition. To further characterize this universality, we introduce the inverted harmonic oscillator as an analytically tractable effective model of instability. By integrating numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck description, and a direct spectral analysis of the stochastic quantum channel, we identify quantum signatures absent in classical limits. The close agreement between quantum simulation, truncated Wigner approximation, and inverted oscillator analysis shows that universal features of the transition are set by uncertainty-limited quantum fluctuations and are insensitive to genuine quantum interference.</description>
