      <title>Numerical investigation of the generalized Jang equation coupled to conformal flow of metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent result of Jaracz has established nonexistence of global solutions to the coupled generalized Jang equation and zero divergence system which satisfy the asymptotic conditions needed to prove the Penrose conjecture by identifying a breakdown mechanism for the Jang slope at finite radius. In this work, we investigate whether a similar obstruction arises when the generalized Jang equation is instead coupled to the conformal flow of metrics. Restricting to spherical symmetry and time-symmetric initial data, we formulate a numerically tractable version of the Jang/conformal flow system. Our numerical results show no evidence of a finite radius breakdown analogous to that observed by Jaracz. Instead, the Jang slope remains regular and approaches its limiting value asymptotically. This behavior persists under controlled perturbations of the warping factor, indicating robustness of the observed phenomenon. These findings suggest that coupling to conformal flow of metrics alters the obstruction mechanism present in the Jang/zero divergence system, and hence that this system may still be viable for proving the Penrose conjecture.</description>

      <title>Compact Stars Sourced by Dark Matter Halos and Their Frozen States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by regular black holes (RBHs) sourced by dark matter halos, we generalize the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor by relaxing the $P_r = -\rho$ condition between radial pressure and density. We demonstrate that while RBHs are a unique special case, a broader class of relations yields horizonless compact stars. Under specific parameter limits, these objects approach a ``frozen state," mimicking black hole features without an event horizon. These compact star solutions could satisfy weak energy conditions and provide a robust mechanism for dark matter-sourced black hole mimickers.</description>

      <title>Gravitational equal-area law and critical phenomena of cuspy black hole shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of a cusp on a black hole shadow is a striking signature of physics beyond the Kerr paradigm. We demonstrate that this morphological change fundamentally alters the shadow's topology with the topological charge flipping from 1 to -1. To analyze this topological transition, we introduce a gravitational equal-area law, analogous to Maxwell's construction in thermodynamics, and identify a critical point for cusp formation. Near this point, we uncover universal behavior characterized by a critical exponent 1/2, which places this gravitational lensing system within the mean-field universality class. These results establish a new framework for testing fundamental physics of black hole shadows, reframing the search for deviations from general relativity as a targeted hunt for a distinct topological and critical phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Black hole based general relativistic limit of f(R) theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center black hole environment gives us new opportunity to test deviation from General Relativity and black hole physics. In this work we analytically generate the shape of the Galactic Center black hole by using a recently developed exact stationary, axisymmetric and vacuum solution of $f(R)$ gravity theory. By using scalaron mass as a free parameter we find that the shadow shape along with displacement and asymmetry is sensitive to the scalaron mass, even after keeping the black hole spin low. We recognize scalaron mass which is compatible with Kerr like quadrupole moment and hence black hole "no-hair" theorem. The same mass scale is found to reproduce the PPN parameter ($\gamma$) constrained in the weak field limit of the solar system. Gravitational identifiers, the Kretschmann scalar ($\kappa$) and gravitational potential ($\phi$) have been used to infer scalaron masses in the regime of S-stars which are found to be consistent with the limits obtained using shadow scales. We ensure that $f(R)$ gravity scalaron has an appropriate general relativistic limit in the horizon scale of the black hole. We also identify the possibility of scale invariance of the General Relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Weyl-transverse gravity with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the covariant phase space formulation of Weyl-transverse gravity (WTG) in the presence of general timelike and spacelike boundaries. WTG is classically equivalent to General Relativity (GR) but possesses a reduced gauge symmetry consisting of Weyl transformations and transverse diffeomorphisms, together with a fixed background volume form. This structure modifies the variational principle and the definition of conserved quantities relative to GR. We derive the symplectic potential, presymplectic current, and Hamiltonian generators associated with transverse diffeomorphisms, and we identify a set of boundary conditions under which the WTG action is differentiable. These include Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for both the auxiliary Weyl-invariant metric and the dynamical metric, as well as a natural implementation of York boundary conditions, for which WTG exhibits a particularly transparent geometric formulation. We obtain the Noether current and surface charge, clarify the role of the Lagrangian ambiguity related to the cosmological constant, and evaluate the Hamiltonian identity on spacetimes containing a bifurcate Killing horizon. The resulting first-law relation shows that variations of the cosmological constant can contribute nontrivially unless additional physical restrictions are imposed.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear tails of massive scalar fields around a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear effects play a fundamental role in the late-time ringdown of black holes, with direct implications for gravitational-wave observations. For massive fields, these dynamics become richer, yet their nonlinear signatures remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically study nonlinear tails of massive scalar perturbations, from a toy model with ingoing and outgoing sources to a self-interacting scalar model, revealing nonlinear tails and contrasting the results with their linear counterparts. We find that the nonlinear tails of massive scalar fields, opposite to massless ones, decay as the same rate as linear tails in the intermediate time, independent of source parameters or initial conditions. Nevertheless, quadratic quasinormal modes could serve as a probe to the nonlinear effects of massive fields.</description>

      <title>Exact Kerr-Newman-(A)dS and other spacetimes in bumblebee gravity: employing a novel generating technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that if the bumblebee field in the Einstein-bumblebee theory is given by its vacuum expectation value ($B_{\mu}=b_{\mu}$) and it is not dynamical ($\partial_{\mu}B_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}B_{\mu}=0$), then these conditions uniquely provide a generating technique, allowing us to construct exact solutions to bumblebee gravity from the vacuum solutions by adding a term $\sim b_{\mu}b_{\nu}$ to the metric tensor. Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it.</description>

      <title>Roche limit and stellar disruption in the Simpson--Visser spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the tidal forces that a black hole can produce, certain types of compact objects may undergo disruption as they approach the black hole. This disruption point is known as the Roche limit (or Roche radius). In this work, we studied the tidal forces arising from the presence of the Simpson--Visser black bounce. We analyzed the tidal forces both for a static observer and for a radially infalling observer and showed that differences arise depending on the choice of observer. We used the tidal forces together with the stellar binding forces to determine the Roche radius for neutron stars, white dwarfs, and Sun-like stars, and to investigate how the Simpson--Visser regularization affects the tidal disruption of these astrophysical objects. We also examined whether, for astrophysical black holes such as M87* and Sgr~A*, these stellar disruption processes occur inside or outside the event horizon, and thus whether they are observable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, due to launch mid-2035, is a large class space mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). In partnership with NASA and ESA-member states, ESA is on track to launch what is expected to be the first space-based gravitational wave detector. By hosting detectors in space, one gains access to a lower frequency band of gravitational wave sources and with them, a plethora of new science. To maximise this scientific gain, ESA and NASA selected 20 scientists for the LISA Science Team, to carry out and/or lead necessary actions on the run up to LISA launch. We give a short overview and update of the LISA mission, some of its science objectives and related waveforms, as well as the work of the LISA Science Team as of December 2025.</description>

      <title>A Computational Companion to Transient de Sitter and Quasi de Sitter States in SO(32) and E_8 X E_8 Heterotic String Theories I: Formalisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct four-dimensional de Sitter space as an excited state, rather than as a vacuum configuration, in type IIB, heterotic SO(32), and heterotic E_8 \times E_8 string theories. This framework provides a mechanism to evade vacuum-based no-go theorems for de Sitter solutions in string theory. Starting from a generic M-theory configuration, we obtain de Sitter isometry in the dual string theories through appropriate dynamical duality sequences in the late-time limit. The excited state, identified as a Glauber-Sudarshan state, is constructed as the expectation value of the metric operator in M-theory using path-integral techniques.
  We further analyze the conditions required for the existence of a well-defined effective field theory description and show that these conditions are equivalent to the Null Energy Condition for a (3+1)-dimensional FLRW cosmology. Finally, we investigate constraints arising from axionic cosmology and demonstrate how the time-dependent solutions are modified when experimental bounds on the axionic coupling constant are taken into account.
  This article serves as a computational companion to sections 3 and 4 of the paper https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.03798.</description>

      <title>Two Fluid Quantum Bouncing Cosmology I: Theoretical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmologies offer an alternative to inflation by resolving the initial
  singularity through a contracting phase followed by a bounce into expansion. In many
  such models, the contracting phase is dominated by a single matter component,
  typically pressureless dust, which leads to an almost scale-invariant spectrum of
  scalar cosmological perturbations with a slight blue tilt, so that generating the
  observed red-tilted spectrum within this framework was challenging. In this work, we
  consider a more realistic scenario in which the contracting phase includes both
  matter and radiation, as required on physical grounds. We show that the presence of
  radiation can naturally induce a red tilt in the spectrum of curvature perturbations
  seeded by quantum vacuum fluctuations in the remote past of the contraction. Since
  the perturbations of the two fluids are coupled via gravity, vacuum initial
  conditions must be carefully defined. We demonstrate that, without fine-tuning, the
  resulting entropy perturbations are subdominant with respect to curvature
  perturbations. This suggests that a minimal two-component bounce model, involving
  only ordinary matter and radiation, can connect to the standard expanding cosmology
  with observationally viable initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Extended symmetry of the Maxwell theory with a gauge coupling constant as a conserved charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that any coupling constant in a covariant action
  can be treated as a conserved charge by promoting the coupling constant to auxiliary fields, typically realized by a scalar field paired with a
  higher-form gauge field. However, the procedure may break local symmetries,
  which can be explicitly shown in a simpler setting such as Maxwell theory.
  The Hamiltonian analysis of Maxwell theory with the auxiliary fields
  reveals that some of the constraints are second-class. Applying the BFT formalism, we restore the broken local symmetries and obtain
  a fully symmetric action defined on an extended configuration space. Despite the restoration of the local symmetries, no additional conserved charges are associated with the recovered symmetries.
  Consequently, the original theory turns out to be the gauge-fixed version of the
  extended theory.</description>

      <title>The initial spin matters: the impact of rapid rotation on magnetic-field amplification at merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A couple of milliseconds after the merger of a binary system of neutron stars can play a fundamental role in amplifying the comparatively low initial magnetic fields into magnetar strengths. The basic mechanism responsible for this amplification is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and we here report the first systematic study of the impact of rapid rotation on the KHI-amplification process exploiting general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations at very high-resolutions of $35\,{\rm m}$. Concentrating on four different spinning configurations, we find that aligned, anti-aligned, and mixed (aligned/anti-aligned) spin configurations lead to markedly different growth rates of the electromagnetic (EM) energy, field topologies, and vortex properties when compared to the irrotational case. These differences arise from intrinsic variations in the system dynamics, such as tidal deformation, collision strength, and contact surface area, with the anti-aligned configuration producing the largest vorticity and growth in EM energy. Importantly, while different spin configurations lead to significantly different initial growth rates of the poloidal/toroidal components, all systems converge to a specific topological partition. Our simulations are confined to a short window in time, but the different EM energies produced as a result of spin will imprint the EM emission at merger and provide information on the spinning state at merger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a spacetime obtained from the semi-classical backreaction computed via the Thermofield dynamics approach in the Poincare patch of de Sitter spacetime. The resulting bulk equation takes the Whittaker form and we examine two distinct applications. At leading order, the co-moving curvature perturbations are shown to match a constant-roll model in the frozen attractor regime, corresponding to a UV enhancement of the spectrum with $n_S \sim 2$. In the holographic context, we compute the CFT two-point function at the future boundary, and away from it we construct the flow-equation of the dual QFT that matches beta-function of the Sp(N ) model in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signature of Aspherical Bubbles Driven by Thermal Fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transitions are a well-motivated source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs), but most predictions are made based on the highly idealized model of perfectly spherical vacuum bubbles, neglecting thermal fluctuations. In this work we use $(3+1)$-dimensional lattice simulations of a scalar model with thermal initial conditions to quantify how thermal fluctuations distort bubble profiles and modify the resulting GW spectrum. We find that thermal fluctuations can strongly break spherical symmetry at early times, allowing even an isolated bubble to emit GWs. In multi-bubble simulations, thermal fluctuations systematically reshape the spectrum, suppressing the infrared part while enhancing and broadening the high-$k$ tail. We further provide an analytical estimate for the ultraviolet regime of the GW spectrum, which is in good agreement with our lattice results and suggests that this regime is dominated by thermal fluctuations. These effects could leave observable imprints in future GW searches.</description>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are commonly divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating sources, but whether these represent distinct physical populations remains uncertain. In this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning methods combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with density-based clustering to analyze CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We find that FRBs remain primarily separated into two clusters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with a recall of 0.94 for known repeaters, indicating strong robustness. Consistent with Catalog 1 analyses, we confirm that the spectral morphology parameter, specifically spectral running remains the key discriminator between the two populations, indicating that narrowband emission is an intrinsic and persistent property of repeating FRBs. With the enlarged Catalog 2 sample, we further identify a stable subclass of atypical repeaters (about $6\%$ of repeating bursts) that are broadband, shorter in duration, and more luminous, resembling non-repeating bursts. The Nonrepeater-like cluster also shows higher inferred energies and dispersion measures, consistent with a scenario in which apparently non-repeating FRBs may result from observational incompleteness, with low-energy repeating bursts remaining undetected. Our results provide new statistical evidence for a physical connection between repeating and non-repeating FRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The McVittie metric does not describe a physical black hole in an expanding Universe because the curvature scalar and pressure at its event horizon are infinite. We show that extending this metric to an inhomogeneous scale factor, which depends on both the time and radial coordinate, removes those infinities by imposing at the horizon the constancy of the Hubble parameter and a particular constraint on the gradient of the scale factor. We consider a special case of this metric, and show that the Hubble parameters at the event horizons of all centrally symmetric black holes are equal to the same constant $H_\textrm{hor}=(\Lambda/3)^{1/2}$. Because of this equality and the equivalence to the Kottler metric near the horizon, black holes do not grow with the Universe expansion.</description>

Abstract: During gravitational collapse of dust in spherical symmetry, matter particles may collide forming shell crossing surfaces (SCS) on which the Einstein equations become indeterministic. We show that there is a unique evolution beyond SCS such that a propagating shock wave forms, the metric remains continuous, and the stress-energy tensor dynamically becomes that of a thin shell. We give numerical simulations that exhibit this result.</description>

      <title>A gravitational spin-orbit interaction in Poincar\'e gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a gravitational spin-orbit interaction that can potentially modify the space-time geometry naturally emerges in the framework of Poincar\'e gauge theory. For this purpose, we derive the field equations of a particular model with cubic order invariants and demonstrate the existence of analytical solutions which display an interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic angular momentum parameters in the gravitational action, in analogy to the spin-orbit interaction arising from atomic and nuclear systems. Due to the highly nonlinear character of the field equations under stationary and axisymmetric conditions, we focus on a degenerate case which simplifies their complexity, at the cost of constraining the geometry to the Kerr space-time. Thereby, our results indicate more general solutions with a spin-orbit interaction beyond the Kerr space-time are expected to arise in the nondegenerate models of Poincar\'e gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend analytic formulas for the gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum from first-order phase transitions to include cosmic expansion under the thin-wall and envelope approximations. We demonstrate that even for strongly supercooled transitions the GW amplitude is bounded from above. This conclusion is explicitly verified for several representative nucleation histories, including delta-function, power-law, and power-exponential types. Moreover, the spectral shape, amplitude, and peak frequency remain largely unaffected by the details of the nucleation rate once expressed in terms of the conformal variables evaluated at an appropriately defined characteristic collision time.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Kruskal Universe: a quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole in unitary unimodular gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the physical properties of an analytical, nonsingular quantum-corrected black hole solution recently derived in a minisuperspace model for unimodular gravity under the assumption of unitarity in unimodular time. We show that the metric corrections compared to the classical Schwarzschild solutions only depend on a single new parameter, corresponding to a minimal radius where a black hole-white hole transition occurs. While these corrections substantially alter the structure of the spacetime near this minimal radius, they fall off rapidly towards infinity, and we show in various examples how physical properties of the exterior spacetime are very close to those of the Schwarzschild solution. We derive the maximal analytic extension of the initial solution, which corresponds to an infinite sequence of Kruskal spacetimes connected via black-to-white hole transitions, and compare with some other proposals for non-singular black hole metrics. The metric violates the achronal averaged null energy condition, which indicates that we are capturing physics beyond the semiclassical approximation. Finally, we include some thoughts on how to go beyond the simple eternal black hole-white hole model presented here.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array analysis in a Legendre polynomial basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Legendre polynomials, previously employed in this context by Lee et al. [1], van Haasteren and Levin [2], and Pitrou and Cusin [3], to model signals in pulsar timing arrays (PTA). These replace the (Fourier mode) basis of trigonometric functions normally used for data analysis. The Legendre basis makes it simpler to incorporate pulsar modeling effects, which remove constant-, linear-, and quadratic-in-time terms from pulsar timing residuals. In the Legendre basis, this zeroes the amplitudes of the the first three Legendre polynomials. We use this basis to construct an optimal quadratic cross-correlation estimator $\widehat{\mu}$ of the Hellings and Downs (HD) correlation and compute its variance $\sigma^2_{\widehat{\mu}}$ in the way described by Allen and Romano [4]. Remarkably, if the gravitational-wave background (GWB) and pulsar noise power spectra are (sums of) power laws in frequency, then in this basis one obtains analytic closed forms for many quantities of interest.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing and resampling: a guide to utilising posterior samples from gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories have opened new scientific research in astrophysics, fundamental physics, and cosmology. The collaborations that build and operate these observatories release the interferometric strain data as well as a catalogue of observed signals with accompanying Bayesian posterior distributions. These posteriors, in the form of equally-weighted samples, form a dataset that is used by a multitude of further analyses seeking to constrain the population of merging black holes, identify lensed pairs of signals, and much more. However, many of these analyses rely, often implicitly, on the ability to reconstruct the likelihood and prior from the inputs to the analysis and apply resampling (a statistical technique to generate new samples varying the underlying analysis assumptions). In this work, we first provide a guide on how to reconstruct and modify the posterior density accurately from the inputs for analyses performed with the Bilby inference library. We then demonstrate and compare resampling techniques to produce new posterior sample sets and discuss Pareto-smoothing to improve the efficiency. Finally, we provide examples of how to use resampling to study observed gravitational-wave signals. We hope this guide provides a useful resource for those wishing to use open data products from the LVK for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spacetimes in general relativity can be uniquely decomposed into a set of multipole moments. Given the usefulness of moments in the categorization of radiation patterns, tidal deformations, and other phenomena associated with compact objects, a number of studies have explored their construction in beyond-Einstein theories of gravity. It is shown here that uniqueness does not necessarily extend across theories: by comparing a few static and spherically-symmetric solutions in different theories, we find that two distinct objects can possess the same Geroch-Hansen moments. Moreover, two metrics can match and yet take different moments. Implications of this result are explored in the context of black-hole shadows and ``universal'' relations hinging on moment computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spatially homogeneous Friedmann--Robertson--Walker universes filled with a massive scalar field in a neighbourhood of the massless transition $s=1$. At this point the Einstein--scalar system exhibits a codimension--two Hopf--steady--state organising centre whose versal unfolding describes all small deformations of the quadratic model. After reduction to the centre manifold, the dynamics is governed by two slow geometric modes $(r,z)$: the Hopf amplitude $r$, measuring the kinetic departure from de Sitter, and the slowly drifting Hubble mode $z$. We show that the standard slow--roll parameters follow directly from these unfolding variables, $\epsilon\sim\tfrac32 r^{2}$ and $\eta\sim z$, so that the spectral tilt, tensor--to--scalar ratio, and scalar amplitude arise as universal functions of $(r,z)$, independently of the choice of potential. The two unfolding parameters $(\mu_{1},\mu_{2})$ classify all perturbations of the quadratic model and can be interpreted physically as controlling the tilt and curvature deformations of generic polynomial inflationary potentials. Thus the near scale--invariance of primordial perturbations emerges as a structural property of the unfolding of the organising centre, providing a potential--independent mechanism for an early phase of accelerated expansion. We discuss the implications of this geometric framework for the interpretation and classification of inflationary models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are limited in localizing nanohertz continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) by uncertainties in pulsar distances. We introduce a method to infer pulsar distances in two dimensions, using phase information from the pulsar terms of multiple CGW sources. Our approach can enhance distance precision and, in some cases, achieve order-of-magnitude improvements relative to existing one-dimensional distance-inference methods. Using simulations of an SKA-era PTA with realistic parallax-based distance priors, we demonstrate that pulsars at $\sim 1$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision with only a few CGW sources. Such improvements in pulsar-distance precision have important implications for CGW host-galaxy identification and multimessenger observational prospects.</description>

      <title>A cyclic quintessence-dominated universe with negative cosmological constant in a scale-invariance modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AdS vacuum corresponds to a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$. While it is well-motivated theoretically, There has always been controversy over its actual existence. The AdS-dS transition is corresponding to a sign switching $\Lambda$. We propose an ansatz for a negative time-varying cosmological constant as a function of Hubble parameter $\Lambda(H)$, and use it in constructing a periodic model with no future singularity in a scale-invariance gravity. While the negative $\Lambda$ ansatz leads to a physically acceptable cosmic description, we get unphysical parameters with positive and zero values of $\Lambda$. The model reveals a sign flipping of cosmic pressure during each period in a quintessence-dominated universe associated with a Quintom behavior occurs near the end of the cycle. The current work represents a revisit to the non-conventional mechanism of negative $\Lambda$ that are expected to address the late-time acceleration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Calibration Method of Spacecraft-Inertial Sensor Center-of-Mass Offset for the Taiji Gravitational Wave Detection Mission under Science Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Surrogate for the Equivalent Diameter of the Kerr Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a closed-form surrogate for the equivalent diameter of the Kerr black-hole shadow, defined as the diameter of the circle with the same area as the shadow's critical curve. The construction enforces the exact face-on (polar) limit by explicitly separating an analytically computed polar contribution based on the spherical photon-orbit branch where the horizontal impact parameter vanishes. The remaining inclination dependence is captured by a compact 15-parameter polynomial placed inside an exponential correction. The coefficients are determined by ordinary least squares on a deterministic reference grid generated from the Kerr critical-curve area. Over the practical domain of dimensionless spin from 0 to 0.998 and inclination from just above 0 degrees up to 90 degrees (with the exactly polar point treated analytically), the surrogate achieves sub-percent accuracy. On the training grid the median absolute percent error is 0.0105 percent with a worst case of 0.782 percent, and on a denser out-of-sample validation set (including inclinations down to 0.5 degrees) the median, 95th-percentile, and worst-case errors are 0.023 percent, 0.471 percent, and 1.64 percent, respectively. The resulting expression provides fast evaluations of the shadow size without numerical ray tracing, making it convenient for repeated calls in parameter inference and rapid model comparisons.</description>

      <title>Plunge-Merger-Ringdown Tests of General Relativity with GW250114</title>

Abstract: The binary black hole signal GW250114, the clearest gravitational wave detected to date, offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity in the relativistic strong-gravity regime. How well does GW250114 agree with Einstein's predictions in the plunge-merger-ringdown stage? To address this point, we constrain deviations from general relativity across the plunge-merger-ringdown stage of spin-precessing binaries with a parametrized waveform model within the effective-one-body formalism. We find that deviations from the peak gravitational-wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$ mode are constrained to about $10\%$ and $4\%$, respectively, at $90\%$ credible level. These constraints are, respectively, two and four times more stringent than those obtained by analyzing GW150914. We also constrain, for the first time, the instantaneous frequency of the $(\ell, |m|)=(4,4)$ mode at merger to about $6\%$, and the time at which the gravitational-wave amplitude peaks to about $5~\mathrm{ms}$. These results are the most precise tests of general relativity in the nonlinear regime to date, and can be employed to constrain extensions of Einsten's theory.</description>

      <title>Different effects of the Lorentz and Gaussian bump functions on the formation of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar perturbations in the inflation can be amplified when the base inflation potential $V_b(\phi)$ incorporates a local bump $f(\phi)$ such as $V(\phi)=V_b(\phi)(1+f(\phi))$. This modification will lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum, increasing a significant abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs). However, since there is no underlying physical reason for the choice of $f(\phi)$, it is essential to investigate the effects of various bump functions on PBH generation. In this paper, we choose the well-known Starobinsky potential as the base inflation potential to compare the effects produced by different bumps, specifically focusing on the Lorentz and Gaussian bumps which are widely used. To clearly illustrate the differences between these two bumps, we keep parameters in bump functions the same. We find an interesting and novel result that the Lorentz cases manifest a stronger ability to enhance the power spectrum and produce more abundance of PBHs than Gaussian cases. Moreover, we also investigate the different effects of bump functions on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). The results indicate that the Lorentz bump generates SIGWs with a higher energy density, which can be potentially detected in the future. Our study gives valuable insights into the choice and constraints on the bump functions, and the different effects may distinguish the two bump cases for practical purposes in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmic acceleration and the Hubble tension from baryon acoustic oscillation data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the null tests of cosmic accelerated expansion by using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and reconstruct the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$ from the DESI BAO Alcock-Paczynski (AP) data using Gaussian process to perform the null test. We find strong evidence of accelerated expansion from the DESI BAO AP data. By reconstructing the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ from the DESI BAO AP data, we find that accelerated expansion persisted until $z \lesssim 0.7$ with a 99.7\% confidence level. Additionally, to provide insights into the Hubble tension problem, we propose combining the reconstructed $E(z)$ with $D_H/r_d$ data to derive the model-independent result $r_d h=99.8\pm 3.1$ Mpc. This result is consistent with measurements from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies using the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also propose a model-independent method for reconstructing the comoving angular diameter distance $D_M(z)$ from the distance modulus $\mu$ using SNe Ia data and combining this result with DESI BAO data of $D_M/r_d$ to constrain the value of $r_d$. We find that the value of $r_d$ derived from this model-independent method is smaller than that obtained from CMB measurements, with a significant discrepancy of at least 4.17$\sigma$. All the conclusions drawn in this paper are independent of cosmological models and gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Constraining electromagnetic couplings of ultralight scalars from compact stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If an ultralight scalar interacts with the electromagnetic fields of a compact rotating star, then a long-range scalar field is developed outside the star. The Coulomb-like profile of the scalar field to the leading order is equivalent to an effective scalar charge on the star. In a binary star system, the scalar-induced charge would result in a long-range force between the stars, with the scalar field acting as the mediator. The scalar-photon interactions would modify Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields in vacuum, resulting in a modified dispersion relation. This could be observed as an apparent redshift for photons emitted by such sources. The scalar field would also induce additional electric and magnetic fields and hence affect the electromagnetic energy radiated from such compact objects. A scalar field sourced by time-varying electromagnetic fields can also carry away energy from a compact star in the form of radiation, and hence contribute to its spin-down luminosity. We constrain the scalar-photon coupling from the measurements of the electromagnetic radiation of a compact star and from its spin-down luminosity, using the Crab pulsar, the soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20, and the gamma ray burst GRB 080905A. We also project the prospective bounds on the coupling from future measurements of the long-range force between two compact stars in a binary such as PSR J0737-3039, and from the apparent redshifts of compact stars. Future advances in precision-clock sensitivity and targeted observations of stars with strong surface magnetic fields, large radii, and low-frequency emission can substantially tighten these coupling limits.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the Origin of Eccentric Black Hole Mergers with Gravitational-wave Spin Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the binary black hole mergers observed with gravitational-wave detectors originate from the evolution of isolated massive binary stars or were dynamically driven by perturbations from the environment. Recent evidence for non-zero orbital eccentricity in a handful of events is seen as support for a non-negligible fraction of the population experiencing external driving of the merger. However, it is unclear from which formation channel eccentric binary black-hole mergers would originate: dense star clusters, hierarchical field triples, active galactic nuclei, or wide binaries in the Galaxy could all be culprits. Here, we investigate whether the spin properties of eccentric mergers could be used to break this degeneracy. Using the fact that different formation channels are predicted to either produce eccentric mergers with mutually aligned or randomly oriented black-hole spins, we investigate how many confident detections would be needed in order for the two models to be statistically distinguishable. If a few percent of binary black hole mergers retain measurable eccentricity in the bandwidth of ground-based detectors, we report a $\sim9\,\%$ chance that we could confidently distinguish both models (Bayes factor $\ln\mathcal{B}&gt;3$) after the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, $\sim63\,\%$ for LIGO A#, and $\sim98\,\%$ for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>Self-bound hybrid stars with strong phase transitions can relieve major compact star observation tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii in the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of self-bound hybrid stars with large density discontinuities, and thus are radially stable in either the slow or rapid phase transition context. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of self-bound hybrid stars with strong phase transitions in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.</description>

      <title>Probing the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic centre with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gigaelectronvolt $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic centre remains unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading explanation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars remains viable. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by interstellar scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge in the future.
  We constructed synthetic populations of detached millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Still, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\sim$0.9 M$_\odot$), though part of this contrast reflects our modelling assumptions. LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Thus, identifying millisecond-pulsar binaries among the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, as their gravitational-wave signals alone are indistinguishable. However, coordinated follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array of LISA-selected targets could directly test the millisecond-pulsar explanation of the $\gamma$-ray excess.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave equation of motion includes direct coupling to the Riemann tensor. The curvature terms are usually neglected, but they can be large at the location of matter particles and impact the angular diameter distance. We apply the recently introduced post-geometrical optics approximation that includes curvature to gravitational wave propagation. Assuming that particles are localised within their Compton wavelength, the curvature due to electrons leads to a large effect on the angular diameter distance, but caustic formation invalidates the post-geometrical optics approximation. We conclude that the interesting regime of validity of the approximation is limited, as it ceases to apply when the curvature effects become large. Other methods are needed to evaluate the effect of curvature spikes, and the localisation of particles due to decoherence also needs further work.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Corrections to Thermodynamics of Accelerating Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As pointed out in recent research, the near extremal black hole entropy with one-loop effect exhibits universal $\log T$ behavior at sufficiently low temperature. In this paper, we discuss the low-temperature quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of four-dimensional accelerating black holes with rotation and charges by using the method of Euclidean path integral. The one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types, with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being $(3/2)\log T$ and $(1/2)\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a warped and twisted product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the gravitational vector modes are absent. For the accelerating black holes with charges, we also consider the one-loop path integral of the gauge field, where the photon zero modes are found to contribute an additional $(1/2)\log T$ term to the near extremal black hole entropy.</description>

Abstract: We extend recent discussions on generalization of the Connected Wedge Theorem about $2$-to-$2$ holographic scattering problem to $n$-to-$n$ scatterings ($n&gt;2$). In this broader setting, our theorem provides a weaker necessary condition for the connectedness of boundary entanglement wedges than previously identified. Besides, we prove a novel sufficient condition for this connectedness. We also present an analysis of the criteria ensuring a non-empty entanglement wedge intersection region $\mathcal{S}_E$. These results refine the holographic dictionary between geometric connectivity and quantum entanglement for general multi-particle scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the gravitational effects of a black hole manifest themselves as thermal behavior in the dual finite-temperature conformal field theory (CFT). In the holographic framework of AdS/CFT, we analyze a wave packet propagating into a black hole geometry in the bulk by computing three-point functions of a scalar primary operator in the boundary CFT. Our setup captures thermal signatures such as exponential damping of the expectation value, which are absent at zero-temperature. This provides a concrete and analytically tractable example of how black hole physics can be probed from the CFT side.</description>

      <title>Hidden pattern of self-invariant cosmic expansion: Empirical evidence from Hubble diagram of supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present empirical evidence extracted directly from the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa demonstrating that the speed of light varies as the universe expands. Moreover, the speed of light must vary in a specific quantifiable manner. To show this, we reformulate the kinematics of late-time acceleration using Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=(t/t_0)^\mu$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_0a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying c along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. The new model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa and exhibits a strong degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates a self-invariant cosmic evolution: at all instants during the late-time epoch, the speed of light is exactly proportional to the rate of cosmic expansion, viz. $c=\mu^{-1}c_0t_0\,da/dt$, a characteristic that is absent in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This synchronous behavior between $c$ and $da/dt$ carries profound cosmological implications that we will discuss, regarding (i) the nature of late-time acceleration; (ii) a resolution to the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalized cosmological principle into the time domain; and (v) a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology. This newfound kinematic $c\propto da/dt$ relation represents a stringent requirement that any viable dynamical model of cosmology must satisfy, a requirement that the $\Lambda$CDM model does not fulfill. Thus, our paper delivers the clearest and most decisive evidence to date that challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of cosmology and calls for variable-$c$ modifications to General Relativity.</description>
