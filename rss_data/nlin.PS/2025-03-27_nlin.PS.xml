      <title>Fractal structure of Christ-Lee model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper numerically investigates the dynamical properties of kink and antikink collisions in the Christ_Lee model in the regime of epsilon approaching the phi4 theory. With given epsilon and the initial velocity Vin, we exhibiting the formation of bion, scattering, and n_bounce states. Additionally, we show the self_similar fractal structures in the plot of Vout_Vin with given epsilon. Specially, we find the fractal structure in the plot of Vout versus epsilon, which is not reported previously. We computes the Box_counting dimension for these fractal structures. We find that the Box_dimension is positively correlated with epsilon, and approaches to Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle when epsilon is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation as a Resilience Mechanism in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical and computational modelling in oncology has played an increasingly important role in not only understanding the impact of various approaches to treatment on tumour growth, but in optimizing dosing regimens and aiding the development of treatment strategies. However, as with all modelling, only an approximation is made in the description of the biological and physical system. Here we show that tissue-scale spatial structure can have a profound impact on the resilience of tumours to immunotherapy using a classical model incorporating IL-2 compounds and effector cells as treatment parameters. Using linear stability analysis, numerical continuation, and direct simulations, we show that diffusing cancer cell populations can undergo pattern-forming (Turing) instabilities, leading to spatially-structured states that persist far into treatment regimes where the corresponding spatially homogeneous systems would uniformly predict a cancer-free state. These spatially-patterned states persist in a wide range of parameters, as well as under time-dependent treatment regimes. Incorporating treatment via domain boundaries can increase this resistance to treatment in the interior of the domain, further highlighting the importance of spatial modelling when designing treatment protocols informed by mathematical models. Counter-intuitively, this mechanism shows that increased effector cell mobility can increase the resilience of tumours to treatment. We conclude by discussing practical and theoretical considerations for understanding this kind of spatial resilience in other models of cancer treatment, in particular those incorporating more realistic spatial transport.</description>
