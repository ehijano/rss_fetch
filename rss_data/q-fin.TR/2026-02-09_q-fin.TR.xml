      <title>Insider Purchase Signals in Microcap Equities: Gradient Boosting Detection of Abnormal Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines whether SEC Form 4 insider purchase filings predict abnormal returns in U.S. microcap stocks. The analysis covers 17,237 open-market purchases across 1,343 issuers from 2018 through 2024, restricted to market capitalizations between \$30M and \$500M. A gradient boosting classifier trained on insider identity, transaction history, and market conditions at disclosure achieves AUC of 0.70 on out-of-sample 2024 data. At an optimized threshold of 0.20, precision is 0.38 and recall is 0.69. The distance from the 52-week high dominates feature importance, accounting for 36% of predictive signal. A momentum pattern emerges in the data: transactions disclosed after price appreciation exceeding 10% yield the highest mean cumulative abnormal return (6.3%) and the highest probability of outperformance (36.7%). This contrasts with the simple mean-reversion intuition often applied to post-run-up entries. The result is robust to winsorization and holds across subsamples. These patterns are consistent with slower information incorporation in illiquid markets, where trend confirmation may filter for higher-conviction insider signals.</description>

      <title>Fill Probabilities in a Limit Order Book with State-Dependent Stochastic Order Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the fill probabilities of limit orders placed at different price levels in a limit order book. These probabilities play a central role in execution optimization, as limit orders are not guaranteed to be executed and inherently involve a trade-off between execution cost and execution risk. We model the limit order book within a general state-dependent stochastic framework, representing its dynamics as a collection of interacting queuing systems while incorporating key stylized market features. Within this framework, we derive semi-analytical expressions for several quantities of interest under state-dependent order flows, including the probability of a mid-price change, the fill probabilities of orders placed at the best quotes, and those of orders placed deeper in the book before the opposite best quote moves. While the framework can be extended to even deeper price levels, the corresponding fill probabilities are typically negligible. We validate the proposed model through extensive numerical experiments using real foreign exchange spot market data. The results demonstrate that the model remains tractable while capturing essential order book dynamics, and that the derived expressions achieve good accuracy in estimating fill probabilities.</description>
