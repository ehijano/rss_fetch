      <title>Abstract ladder operators for non self-adjoint Hamiltonians, with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ladder operators are useful, if not essential, in the analysis of some given physical system since they can be used to find easily eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its Hamiltonian. In this paper we extend our previous results on abstract ladder operators considering in many details what happens if the Hamiltonian of the system is not self-adjoint. Among other results, we give an existence criterion for coherent states constructed as eigenstates of our lowering operators. In the second part of the paper we discuss two different examples of our framework: pseudo-quons and a deformed generalized Heisenberg algebra. Incidentally, and interestingly enough, we show that pseudo-quons can be used to diagonalize an oscillator-like Hamiltonian written in terms of (non self-adjoint) position and momentum operators which obey a deformed commutation rule of the kind often considered in minimal length quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Circular symmetry-breaking and topological Noether currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a toy model for the algebraic topology of bubbling as circular symmetry-breaking, in terms of asymptotic expressions for Noether currents and cobordism of manifolds with circle actions free along boundaries. This leads to an interpretation of Planck's radiation law as the loss of a Noether symmetry when a bubble $[S^2/\mathbb{T}] \to {\rm pt}$ (analogous to blowing up or down in projective geometry) collapses, much like the von K\'arm\'an street of sparks left when a candle flame wisps out.</description>

      <title>Linear Criterion for an Upper Bound on the BCS Critical Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since BCS theory of superconductivity is non-linear, it is difficult to study superconducting properties analytically. There is a more tractable linear criterion which determines a temperature $T_l$ below which the system is superconducting. Here, we observe that there is a similar linear criterion which gives a temperature $T_u$ above which no superconductivity occurs. We provide examples of translation invariant systems where $T_u&gt;T_l$ as well as systems where $T_u=T_l$. Furthermore, we estimate $T_u$ for half-spaces and show that it is exponentially small in the weak coupling limit, exhibiting the same asymptotics as the critical temperature for full space.</description>

      <title>Spin chain techniques for angular momentum quasicharacters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ring of invariant functions over the $N$-fold Cartesian product of copies of the compact Lie group $G=SU(2)$, modulo the action of conjugation by the diagonal subgroup, generalizing the group character ring. For $N=1$, an orthonormal basis for the space of invariant functions is given by the irreducible characters, and the structure constants under pointwise multiplication are the coefficients of the Clebsch-Gordan series for the reduction of angular momentum tensor products ($3j$ coefficients). For $N \ge 2$, the structure constants under pointwise multiplication of the corresponding invariants, which we term irreducible quasicharacters, are Racah $3(2N\!-\!1)j$ recoupling coefficients, which can be decomposed as products of $9j$ coefficients (for $N=2$, they are squares thereof). We identify the irreducible quasicharacters for $\times^N\! SU(2)$ with traces of representations of group elements, over totally coupled angular momentum states labelled by binary coupling trees $T$ with $N$ leaves, $N\!-\!1$ internal vertices and associated intermediate edge labels. Using concrete spin chain realizations and projection techniques, we give explicit constructions for some low degree $N=2, 3$ and $4$ quasicharacters. In the case $N=2$, related methods are used to work out the expansions of products of generic, with elementary spin-$\textstyle{\frac 12}$, quasicharacters (equivalent to an \emph{ab initio} evaluation of certain basic $9j$ coefficients). We provide an appendix which summarizes formal properties of the quasicharacter calculus known from our previous work for both $SU(2)$ and for compact $G$ (J Math Phys 59 (8) 083505 (2018) and 62(3) 033514 (2021). In particular, we provide an explicit derivation for the $N=2$ angular momentum quasicharacter product rule.</description>

      <title>Representations of quadratic Heisenberg-Weyl algebras and polynomials in the fourth Painlev\'e transcendent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new insights into the solvability property of an Hamiltonian involving of the fourth Painlev\'e transcendent and its derivatives. This Hamiltonian is third order shape invariant and can also be interpreted within the context of second supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In addition, this Hamiltonian admits third order lowering and raising operators. We will consider the case when this Hamiltonian is irreducible i.e. when no special solutions exist for given parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the fourth Painlev\'e transcendent $P_{IV}(x,\alpha,\beta)$. This means that the Hamiltonian does not admit a potential in terms of rational functions ( or hypergeometric type of special functions ) for those parameters. In such irreducible case, the ladder operators are involving the fourth Painlev\'e transcendent and its derivative. An important case for which this occurs is when the second parameter (i.e. $\beta$) of the fourth Painlev\'e transcendent $P_{IV}(x,\alpha,\beta)$ is strictly positive i.e. $\beta&gt;0$. This Hamiltonian has been studied for all hierarchies of rational solutions that comes in three families connected to the generalised Hermite and Okamoto polynomials. The explicit form of ladder, the associated wavefunctions involving exceptional orthogonal polynomials and recurrence relations were also completed described. Here, we develop a description of the induced representations based on various commutator identities for highest and lowest weight type representations for the irreducible case. We also provide for such representations new formula concerning the explicit form of the related excited states from point of view of the Schrodinger equation as two variables polynomials that involve the fourth Painlev\'e transcendent and its derivative.</description>

      <title>Triviality proof for mean-field $\varphi_4^4$-theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential equations of the Wilson renormalization group are a powerful tool to study the Schwinger functions of Euclidean quantum field theory. In particular renormalization theory can be based entirely on inductively bounding their perturbatively expanded solutions. Recently the solutions of these equations for scalar field theory have been analysed rigorously without recourse to perturbation theory, at the cost of restricting to the mean-field approximation. In particular it was shown there that one-component $\varphi^4_4$-theory is trivial if the bare coupling constant of the UV regularized theory is not large. This paper presents progress w.r.t. Kopper's previous paper on asymptotically free solutions of the mean-field scalar flow equations: 1. The upper bound on the bare coupling is sent to infinity and the proof is extended to $O(N)$ vector models. 2. The unphysical infrared cutoff used for technical simplicity is replaced by a physical mass.</description>

      <title>Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces from conformal transformations and some of its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of two classes of Lie-Hamilton systems on the Euclidean plane to two-dimensional curved spaces, leading to novel Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian spaces (flat $2$-torus, product of hyperbolic lines, sphere and hyperbolic plane), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter, and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as to semi-Riemannian spaces (Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes). The vector fields, Hamiltonian functions, symplectic form and constants of the motion of the Euclidean classes are recovered by a contraction process. The construction is based on the structure of certain subalgebras of the so-called conformal algebras of the two-dimensional Cayley-Klein spaces. These curved Lie-Hamilton classes allow us to generalize naturally the Riccati, Kummer-Schwarz and Ermakov equations on the Euclidean plane to curved spaces, covering both the Riemannian and Lorentzian possibilities, and where the curvature can be considered as an integrable deformation parameter of the initial Euclidean system.</description>

      <title>Representations of the super-Yangian of type $D(n,m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classification problem for finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Yangians associated with the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebras ${\frak{osp}}_{2n|2m}$ with $n\geqslant 2$. We give necessary conditions for an irreducible highest weight representation to be finite-dimensional. We conjecture that these conditions are also sufficient and prove the conjecture for a class of representations with linear highest weights. The arguments are based on a new type of odd reflections for the Yangian associated with ${\frak{osp}}_{2|2}$. In the Appendix, we construct an isomorphism between the Yangians associated with the Lie superalgebras ${\frak{osp}}_{2|2}$ and ${\frak{gl}}_{1|2}$.</description>

      <title>Berwald $m$-Kropina Spaces of Arbitrary Signature: Metrizability and Ricci-Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (pseudo-)Riemann-metrizability and Ricci-flatness of Finsler spaces with $m$-Kropina metric $F = \alpha^{1+m}\beta^{-m}$ of Berwald type are investigated. We prove that the affine connection on $F$ can locally be understood as the Levi-Civita connection of some (pseudo-)Riemannian metric if and only if the Ricci tensor of the canonical affine connection is symmetric. We also obtain a third equivalent characterization in terms of the covariant derivative of the 1-form $\beta$. We use these results to classify all locally metrizable $m$-Kropina spaces whose 1-forms have a constant causal character. In the special case where the first de Rahm cohomology group of the underlying manifold is trivial (which is true of simply connected manifolds, for instance), we show that global metrizability is equivalent to local metrizability and hence, in that case, our necessary and sufficient conditions also characterize global metrizability. In addition, we further obtain explicitly all Ricci-flat, locally metrizable $m$-Kropina metrics in $(3+1)$D whose 1-forms have a constant causal character. In fact, the only possibilities are essentially the following two: either $\alpha$ is flat and $\beta$ is $\alpha$-parallel, or $\alpha$ is a pp-wave and $\beta$ is $\alpha$-parallel.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solutions for the Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose integral representations and analytical solutions for the propagator of the $1+1$ dimensional Salpeter Hamiltonian, describing a relativistic quantum particle with no spin. We explore the exact Green function and an exact solution for a given initial condition, and also find the asymptotic solutions in some limiting cases. The analytical extension of the Hamiltonian in the complex plane allows us to formulate the equivalent stochastic problem, namely the B\"aumer equation. This equation describes \textit{relativistic} stochastic processes with time-changing anomalous diffusion. This B\"aumer propagator corresponds to the Green function of a relativistic diffusion process that interpolates between Cauchy distributions for small times and Gaussian diffusion for large times, providing a framework for stochastic processes where anomalous diffusion is time-dependent.</description>

      <title>Conceptual and formal groundwork for the study of resource dependence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A resource theory imposes a preorder over states, with one state being above another if the first can be converted to the second by a free operation, and where the set of free operations defines the notion of resourcefulness under study. In general, the location of a state in the preorder of one resource theory can constrain its location in the preorder of a different resource theory. It follows that there can be nontrivial dependence relations between different notions of resourcefulness. In this article, we lay out the conceptual and formal groundwork for the study of resource dependence relations. In particular, we note that the relations holding among a set of monotones that includes a complete set for each resource theory provides a full characterization of resource dependence relations. As an example, we consider three resource theories concerning the about-face asymmetry properties of a qubit along three mutually orthogonal axes on the Bloch ball, where about-face symmetry refers to a representation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, consisting of the identity map and a $\pi$ rotation about the given axis. This example is sufficiently simple that we are able to derive a complete set of monotones for each resource theory and to determine all of the relations that hold among these monotones, thereby completely solving the problem of determining resource dependence relations. Nonetheless, we show that even in this simplest of examples, these relations are already quite nuanced.</description>

      <title>Exact solitary wave solutions for a coupled gKdV-Schrodinger system by a new ODE reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method is developed for finding exact solitary wave solutions of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation with p-power nonlinearity coupled to a linear Schr\"odinger equation arising in many different physical applications. This method yields 22 solution families, with p=1,2,3,4. No solutions for p&gt;1 were known previously in the literature. For p=1, four of the solution families contain bright/dark Davydov solitons of the 1st and 2nd kind, obtained in recent work by basic ansatze applied to the ODE system for travelling waves. All of the new solution families have interesting features, including bright/dark peaks with (up to) p symmetric pairs of side peaks in the amplitude and a kink profile for the nonlinear part in the phase. The present method is fully systematic and involves several novel steps which reduce the travelling wave ODE system to a single nonlinear base ODE for which all polynomial solutions are found by symbolic computation. It is applicable more generally to other coupled nonlinear dispersive wave equations as well as to nonlinear ODE systems of generalized H\'enon-Heiles form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a massive scalar field non-minimally coupled with gravity is considered. Assuming a regular and spherically symmetric background, specifically a regular black hole solution, the energy-momentum tensor is calculated. Using the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism and its topological structure, the corresponding Stefan-Boltzmann law and Casimir effect are investigated. The results for the regular black hole are compared with those obtained for the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>A straightforward construction of $\Bbb Z$-graded Lie algebras of full-fledged nonlocal symmetries via recursion operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the reduced quasi-classical self-dual Yang-Mills equation (rYME) and two recently found (Jahnov\'{a} and Voj\v{c}\'{a}k, 2024) invertible recursion operators $\mathcal{R}^q$ and $\mathcal{R}^m$ for its full-fledged (in a given differential covering) nonlocal symmetries. We introduce a $\mathbb{Z}$-grading on the Lie algebra $\mathrm{sym}_{\mathcal{L}}^{\tau^W} (\mathcal E)$ of all nonlocal Laurent polynomial symmetries of the rYME and prove that both the operators $\mathcal{R}^q$ and $\mathcal{R}^m$ are $\mathbb{Z}$-graded automorphisms of the underlying vector space on the set $\mathrm{sym}_{\mathcal{L}}^{\tau^W} (\mathcal E)$. This inter alia implies that all its vector subspaces formed by all homogeneous elements of a given fixed degree (i.e. a weight in the context below) are mutually isomorphic, and thus each of them can be uniquely reconstructed from the vector space of all homogeneous symmetries of the zero degree. To the best of our knowledge, such a result is unparalleled in the current body of literature. The obtained results are used for the construction of a Lie subalgebra $V$ of $\mathrm{sym}_{\mathcal{L}}^{\tau^W} (\mathcal E)$ which contains all known to us nonlocal Laurent polynomial symmetries of the rYME. The Lie algebra $V$ is subsequently described as the linear span of the orbits of a set of selected zero-weight symmetries - we refer to them as to the seed generators of $V$. Further, we study the hierarchies of symmetries related to the seed generators under the action of the group of recursion operators generated by $\mathcal{R}^q$ and $\mathcal{R}^m$. Finally, the linear dependence/independence of the (sub)set of generators of $V$ is discussed.</description>

      <title>Duality Operator in Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleparallel gravity is a theory of gravity which replaces the Levi-Civita connection by a teleparallel connection - a metric-compatible connection with vanishing curvature. Teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) is a special case from this class of theories, and its dynamics is governed by equations which are equivalent to Einstein field equations of general relativity. In 2009 Lucas and Pereira presented the idea of a new operator that would allow us to express the action of TEGR in a form reminiscent of the Yang-Mills action for a gauge theory, for which torsion is the field strength. The authors constructed the operator as a duality operator acting on torsion 2-forms and curvature 2-forms, taking into account all the contractions of these forms with the volume form of the spacetime manifold. The definition of this operator for other forms, however, remained unclear. In this thesis, we seek to give a mathematically consistent definition of the operator, and we follow the results published by Lucas and Pereira. We show that the approach taken by Lucas and Pereira does not lead to a consistent definition of this operator, because it results in the operator with the desired properties either being non-unique or non-existent.</description>

      <title>On gaps in the spectra of quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators with discontinuous monotone potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, for one-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operators, stability of Anderson localization under a class of rank one perturbations implies absence of intervals in spectra. The argument is based on well-known result of Gordon and Simon, combined with a way to consider perturbations whose ranges are not necessarily cyclic. The main application of the results is showing that a class of quasiperiodic operators with sawtooth-like potentials, for which such a version of stable localization is known, has Cantor spectra. We also obtain several results on gap filling under rank one perturbations for some general (not necessarily monotone) classes of quasiperiodic operators with discontinuous potentials.</description>

      <title>Swampland Program for Hypergeometric Inflation Scenarios in Rescaled Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate hypergeometric stringy corrections in the swampland program for rescaled gravity. Precisely, we study inflationary models from Gauss-Bonnet hypergeometric scalar couplings via the falsification scenario. We first derive generalized exponential potentials from such hypergeometric behaviors. Then, we examine certain selected scalar potentials by computing the relevant cosmological quantities using the slow-roll mechanism. Choosing specific points in the corresponding moduli space, we provide viable findings corroborated by Planck observational data and checked by the swampland criteria.</description>

      <title>A quantum deformation of the ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unital associative algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, having $q$ and $k$ as complex parameters, generated by the elements $K^\pm_m$ ($\pm m\geq 0$), $T_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}$), and $G^\pm_m$ ($m\in \mathbb{Z}+{1\over 2}$ in the Neveu-Schwarz sector, $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ in the Ramond sector), satisfying relations which are at most quartic. Calculations of some low-lying Kac determinants are made, providing us with a conjecture for the factorization property of the Kac determinants. The analysis of the screening operators gives a supporting evidence for our conjecture. It is shown that by taking the limit $q\rightarrow 1$ of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ we recover the ordinary ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra. We also give a nontrivial Heisenberg representation of the algebra ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$, making a twist of the $U(1)$ boson in the Wakimoto representation of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$, which naturally follows from the construction of ${\mathcal{SV}ir\!}_{q,k}$ by gluing the deformed $Y$-algebras of Gaiotto and Rap$\check{\mathrm{c}}$\'{a}k.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian skin effect in arbitrary dimensions: non-Bloch band theory and classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a distinctive phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by a significant accumulation of eigenstates at system boundaries. While well-understood in one dimension via non-Bloch band theory, unraveling the NHSE in higher dimensions faces formidable challenges due to the diversity of open boundary conditions or lattice geometries and inevitable numerical errors. Key issues, including higher-dimensional non-Bloch band theory, geometric dependency, spectral convergence and stability, and a complete classification of NHSE, remain elusive. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a geometry-adaptive non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary dimensions, through the lens of spectral potential. Our formulation accurately determines the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone for a given geometry in the thermodynamic limit (TDL), revealing their geometric dependencies. Furthermore, we systematically classify the NHSE into critical and non-reciprocal types using net winding numbers. In the critical case, we identify novel scale-free skin modes residing on the boundary. In the nonreciprocal case, the skin modes manifest in various forms, including normal or anomalous corner modes, boundary modes or scale-free modes. We reveal the non-convergence and instability of the non-Bloch spectra in the presence of scale-free modes and attribute it to the non-exchangeability of the zero-perturbation limit and the TDL. The instability drives the energy spectra towards the Amoeba spectra in the critical case. Our findings provide a unified non-Bloch band theory governing the energy spectra, density of states, and generalized Brillouin zone in the TDL, offering a comprehensive understanding of NHSE in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of locally stable Gibbs point processes via spatial birth-death dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every locally stable and tempered pair potential $\phi$ with bounded range, there exists a unique infinite-volume Gibbs point process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for every activity $\lambda &lt; (e^{L} \hat{C}_{\phi})^{-1}$, where $L$ is the local stability constant and $\hat{C}_{\phi}:= \mathrm{sup}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} 1 - e^{-|\phi(x, y)|} dy$ is the (weak) temperedness constant. Our result extends the uniqueness regime that is given by the classical Ruelle--Penrose bound by a factor of at least $e$, where the improvements becomes larger as the negative parts of the potential become more prominent (i.e., for attractive interactions at low temperature). Our technique is based on the approach of Dyer et al. (Rand. Struct. &amp; Alg. '04): we show that for any bounded region and any boundary condition, we can construct a Markov process (in our case spatial birth-death dynamics) that converges rapidly to the finite-volume Gibbs point process while effects of the boundary condition propagate sufficiently slowly. As a result, we obtain a spatial mixing property that implies uniqueness of the infinite-volume Gibbs measure.</description>

      <title>Two-parameter quantum groups and $R$-matrices: classical types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct finite $R$-matrices for the first fundamental representation $V$ of two-parameter quantum groups $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$, both through the decomposition of $V\otimes V$ into irreducibles $U_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$-submodules as well as by evaluating the universal $R$-matrix. The latter is crucially based on the construction of dual PBW-type bases of $U^{\pm}_{r,s}(\mathfrak{g})$ consisting of the ordered products of quantum root vectors defined via $(r,s)$-bracketings and combinatorics of standard Lyndon words. We further derive explicit formulas for affine $R$-matrices, both through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [M.Ge, Y.Wu, K.Xue, "Explicit trigonometric Yang-Baxterization", Internat. J. Modern Phys. A 6 (1991), no.21, 3735-3779] and as the unique intertwiner between the tensor product of $V(u)$ and $V(v)$, viewed as modules over two-parameter quantum affine algebras $U_{r,s}(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ for classical $\mathfrak{g}$. The latter generalizes the formulas of [M.Jimbo, "Quantum R matrix for the generalized Toda system", Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), no. 4, 537-547] for one-parametric quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the representability of toric code ground states by Restricted Boltzmann Machine with only local connections between hidden and visible neurons. This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability to represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann Machine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential non-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically solvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved using machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$ to $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry multi-reduction method for partial differential equations with conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.10839v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For partial differential equations (PDEs) that have $n\geq2$ independent variables and a symmetry algebra of dimension at least $n-1$, an explicit algorithmic method is presented for finding all symmetry-invariant conservation laws that will reduce to first integrals for the ordinary differential equation (ODE) describing symmetry-invariant solutions of the PDE. This significantly generalizes the double reduction method known in the literature. Moreover, the condition of symmetry-invariance of a conservation law is formulated in an improved way by using multipliers, thereby allowing symmetry-invariant conservation laws to be obtained directly, without the need to first find conservation laws and then check their invariance. This cuts down considerably the number and complexity of computational steps involved in the reduction method. If the space of symmetry-invariant conservation laws has dimension $m\geq 1$, then the method yields $m$ first integrals along with a check of which ones are non-trivial via their multipliers. Several examples of interesting symmetry reductions are considered: travelling waves and similarity solutions in $1+1$ dimensions; line travelling waves, line similarity solutions, and similarity travelling waves in $2+1$ dimensions; rotationally symmetric similarity solutions in $n+1$ dimensions. In addition, examples of nonlinear PDEs for which the method yields the explicit general solution for symmetry-invariant solutions are shown.</description>

      <title>Smooth Solutions of the tt* Equation: A Numerical Aided Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.13639v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important special class of the tt* equations are the tt*-Toda equations. Guest et al. have given comprehensive studies on the tt*-Toda equations in a series of papers. The fine asymptotics for a large class of solutions of a special tt*-Toda equation, the case 4a in their classification, have been obtained in the paper [Comm. Math. Phys. 374 (2020), 923-973] in the series. Most of these formulas are obtained with elaborate reasoning and the calculations involved are lengthy. There are concerns about these formulas if they have not been verified by other methods. The first part of this paper is devoted to the numerical verification of these fine asymptotics. In fact, the numerical studies can do more and should do more. A natural question is whether we can find more such beautiful formulas in the tt* equation via numerical study. The second part of this paper is devoted to the numerical study of the fine asymptotics of the solutions in an enlarged class defined from the Stoke data side. All the fine asymptotics of the solutions in the enlarged class are found by the numerical study. The success of the numerical study is largely due to the truncation structures of the tt* equation.</description>

Abstract: A methodology for deriving dual variational principles for the classical Newtonian mechanics of mass points in the presence of applied forces, interaction forces, and constraints, all with a general dependence on particle velocities and positions, is presented. Methods for incorporating constraints are critically assessed. General theory, as well as explicitly worked out variational principles for a dissipative system (due to Lorenz) and a system with anholonomic constraints (due to Pars) are demonstrated. Conditions under which a (family of) dual Hamiltonian flow(s), as well as a constant(s) of motion, may be associated with a conservative or dissipative, and possibly constrained, primal system naturally emerge in this work.</description>

      <title>A class of 2 X 2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of 2 X 2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions that are imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present model, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2 X 2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time dependent experimental data are always collected at discrete grids with respect to the time t. The step size h of such a grid is always separated from zero by a certain positive number. The same is true for all computations, which are always done on discrete grids with their grid step sizes being not too small. These applied considerations prompt us to introduce a new type of Ill-Posed Problems and Coefficient Inverse Problems (CIP)for parabolic equations. In these problems the t-derivatives of corresponding parabolic operators are written in finite differences with the grid step size being separated from zero. We call this the "t-finite difference framework" (TFD). We address three long standing open questions within the TFD framework. Finally, a numerical method is developed for the CIP of monitoring epidemics. The global convergence of this method is proven.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A gauge invariant mathematical formalism based on deformation quantization is outlined to model an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric system of a spin $1/2$ charged particle placed in a nocommutative plane under the influence of a vertical uniform magnetic field. The noncommutative involutive algebra $(C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})[[\vartheta]],*^r)$ of formal power series in $\vartheta$ with coefficients in the commutative ring $C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ was employed to construct the relevant observables, viz., SUSY Hamiltonian $H$, supercharge operator $Q$ and its adjoint $Q^{\dag}$ all belonging to the $2\times 2$ matrix algebra $\mathcal{M}_{2}(C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{2})[[\vartheta]],*^r)$ with the help of a family of gauge-equivalent star products $*^{r}$. The energy eigenvalues of the SUSY Hamiltonian all turned out to be independent of not only the gauge parameter $r$ but also the noncommutativity parameter $\vartheta$. The nontrivial Fermionic ground state was subsequently computed associated with the zero energy which indicates that supersymmetry remains unbroken in all orders of $\vartheta$. The Witten index for the noncommutative SUSY Landau problem turns out to be $-1$ corroborating the fact that there is no broken supersymmetry for the model we are considering.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the dynamics of a tracer particle coupled to a Bose scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a tracer particle coupled to a Bose scalar field and study the regime where the field's propagation speed approaches infinity. For initial states devoid of field excitations, we introduce an effective approximation of the time-evolved wave function and prove its validity in Hilbert space norm. In this approximation, the field remains in the vacuum state while the tracer particle propagates with a modified dispersion relation. Physically, the new dispersion relation can be understood as the effect of radiative corrections due to interactions with virtual bosons. Mathematically, it is defined as the solution of a self-consistent equation, whose form depends on the relevant time scale.</description>

      <title>Affine subgroups of the affine Coxeter group with the same Coxeter number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine subgroups having the same Coxeter number with the affine Coxeter groups W(An), W(Dn), and W(En) are constructed by graph folding technique. The affine groups W(Cn) and W(Bn) are obtained from the Coxeter groups W(A2n-1) and W(D2n-1) respectively. The affine groups W(E6), W(D6) and W(E8) lead to the affine groups W(F4), W(H3), and W(H4) respectively by graph folding. The latter two are the non-crystallographic groups where W(H3) plays a special role in the quasicrystallographic structures with icosahedral symmetry. A general construction of the affine dihedral subgroups is introduced, some of which, describe the existing planar quasicrystallography. In the construction of the root systems, sets of orthonormal vectors are used but a special non-orthogonal set of vectors in the formulation of the root system of W(An) is also introduced which has practical applications in the construction of the lattices An and An* and their Delone and Voronoi cells.</description>

      <title>The generalized strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy for bosonic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.05627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy for bosonic quantum Gaussian systems. Such generalization determines the minimum values of linear combinations of the entropies of subsystems associated to arbitrary linear functions of the quadratures, and holds for arbitrary quantum states including the scenario where the entropies are conditioned on a memory quantum system. We apply our result to prove new entropic uncertainty relations with quantum memory, a generalization of the quantum Entropy Power Inequality, and the linear time scaling of the entanglement entropy produced by quadratic Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time weakly self-avoiding walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ has strictly monotone escape speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly self-avoiding walk (WSAW) is a model of simple random walk paths that penalizes self-intersections. On $\mathbb{Z}$, Greven and den Hollander proved in 1993 that the discrete-time weakly self-avoiding walk has an asymptotically deterministic escape speed, and they conjectured that this speed should be strictly increasing in the repelling strength parameter. We study a continuous-time version of the model, give a different existence proof for the speed, and prove the speed to be strictly increasing. The proof uses a transfer matrix method implemented via a supersymmetric version of the BFS--Dynkin isomorphism theorem, spectral theory, Tauberian theory, and stochastic dominance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the leading (first-type Landau) singularities of a certain four-loop 7-point graph that is related to the 7-point ``ziggurat'' graph by the graphical moves familiar from equivalent circuit theory. We find perfect agreement with a subset of the ``heptagon symbol alphabet'' that has appeared in the context of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. The remaining heptagon symbol letters are found in its subleading Landau singularities, which we address in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Cycles on Ammann-Beenker Tilings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01940v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a simple algorithm for constructing Hamiltonian graph cycles (visiting every vertex exactly once) on a set of arbitrarily large finite subgraphs of aperiodic two-dimensional Ammann-Beenker (AB) tilings. Using this result, and the discrete scale symmetry of AB tilings, we find exact solutions to a range of other problems which lie in the complexity class NP-complete for general graphs. These include the equal-weight traveling salesperson problem, providing, for example, the most efficient route a scanning tunneling microscope tip could take to image the atoms of physical quasicrystals with AB symmetries; the longest path problem, whose solution demonstrates that collections of flexible molecules of any length can adsorb onto AB quasicrystal surfaces at density one, with possible applications to catalysis; and the three-coloring problem, giving ground states for the $q$-state Potts model ($q \ge 3$) of magnetic interactions defined on the planar dual to AB, which may provide useful models for protein folding.</description>

      <title>Extremal Black Holes as Relativistic Systems with Kepler Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of gravitational waves emanating from inspiralling black hole binaries has triggered a renewed interest in the dynamics of relativistic two-body systems. The conservative part of the latter are given by Hamiltonian systems obtained from so called post-Newtonian expansions of the general relativistic description of black hole binaries. In this paper we study the general question of whether there exist relativistic binaries that display Kepler-like dynamics with elliptical orbits. We show that an orbital equivalence to the Kepler problem indeed exists for relativistic systems with a Hamiltonian of a Kepler-like form. This form is realised by extremal black holes with electric charge and scalar hair to at least first order in the post-Newtonian expansion for arbitrary mass ratios and to all orders in the post-Newtonian expansion in the test-mass limit of the binary. Moreover, to fifth post-Newtonian order, we show that Hamiltonians of the Kepler-like form can be related explicitly through a canonical transformation and time reparametrization to the Kepler problem, and that all Hamiltonians conserving a Laplace-Runge-Lenz-like vector are related in this way to Kepler.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body interactions on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networked systems in fields such as physics, biology, and social sciences often involve interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise ones. Hypergraphs serve as powerful modeling tools for describing and analyzing the intricate behaviors of systems with multi-body interactions. Herein, we investigate a discrete-time nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body interactions: an underlying hypergraph, comprising triples as hyperedges, delineates the structure of these interactions, while the vertices update their states through a weighted, state-dependent average of neighboring pairs' states. This dynamics captures reinforcing group effects, such as peer pressure, and exhibits higher-order dynamical effects resulting from a complex interplay between initial states, hypergraph topology, and nonlinearity of the update. Differently from linear averaging dynamics on graphs with two-body interactions, this model does not converge to the average of the initial states but rather induces a shift. By assuming random initial states and by making some regularity and density assumptions on the hypergraph, we prove that the dynamics converges to a multiplicatively-shifted average of the initial states, with high probability. We further characterize the shift as a function of two parameters describing the initial state and interaction strength, as well as the convergence time as a function of the hypergraph structure.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies bounded conditions on curvature tensors. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16939v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonality of eigenstates of different energies and its implications in potential scattering are unlabeled. Scalar products of scattering states of different energies are found to have finite non-orthogonal terms in potentials of finite widths. Their superpositions have time-dependent norms, and are not suitable for isolate states. In these systems, a perturbative method and a variational method are viable methods for finding a rigorous transition probability that describes phenomena completely. In various exceptional potentials, an orthogonality is satisfied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define \emph{$0$-shifted} and \emph{$+1$-shifted contact structures} on differentiable stacks, thus laying the foundations of \emph{shifted Contact Geometry}. As a side result we show that the kernel of a multiplicative $1$-form on a Lie groupoid (might not exist as a Lie groupoid but it) always exists as a differentiable stack, and it is naturally equipped with a stacky version of the curvature of a distribution. Contact structures on orbifolds provide examples of $0$-shifted contact structures, while prequantum bundles over $+1$-shifted symplectic groupoids provide examples of $+1$-shifted contact structures. Our shifted contact structures are related to shifted symplectic structures via a Symplectic-to-Contact Dictionary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motivation for this paper is the analysis of the fixed-density Ising lattice gas in the presence of a gravitational field. This is a seen as a particular instance of an Ising model with a slowly varying magnetic field in the fixed magnetization ensemble. We first characterize the typical magnetization profiles in the regime in which the contribution of the magnetic field competes with the bulk energy term. We then discuss in more detail the particular case of a gravitational field and the arising interfacial phenomena. In particular, we identify the macroscopic profile and propose several conjectures concerning the interface appearing in the phase coexistence regime. The latter are supported by explicit computations in an effective model. Finally, we state some conjectures concerning equilibrium crystal shapes in the presence of a gravitational field, when the latter contributes to the energy only to surface order.</description>

      <title>Concentration and local smoothness of the averaging process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the averaging process on the discrete $d$-dimensional torus. On this graph, the process is known to converge to equilibrium on diffusive timescales, not exhibiting cutoff. In this work, we refine this picture in two ways. Firstly, we prove a concentration phenomenon of the averaging process around its mean, occurring on a shorter timescale than the one of its relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we establish sharp gradient estimates, which capture its fast local smoothness property. This is the first setting in which these two features of the averaging process -- concentration and local smoothness -- can be quantified. These features carry useful information on a number of large scale properties of the averaging process. As an illustration of this fact, we determine the limit profile of its distance to equilibrium and derive a quantitative hydrodynamic limit for it. Finally, we discuss their implications on cutoff for the binomial splitting process, the particle analogue of the averaging process.</description>

Abstract: We propose the representation principle to study physical systems with a given symmetry. In the context of symmetry enriched topological orders, we give the appropriate representation category, the category of SET orders. For fusion n-category symmetries, we show that the category of SET orders encodes almost all information about the interplay between symmetry and topological orders, in a natural and canonical way. These information include defects and boundaries of SET orders, symmetry charges, explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking, stacking of SET orders, gauging of generalized symmetry, as well as quantum currents (SymTFT or symmetry TO). We also provide a detailed categorical algorithm to compute the generalized gauging. In particular, we proved that gauging is always reversible, as a special type of Morita-equivalence. The explicit data for ungauging, the inverse to gauging, is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit and extend the Durdevic theory of complete calculi on quantum principal bundles. In this setting one naturally obtains a graded Hopf-Galois extension of the higher order calculus and an intrinsic decomposition of degree 1-forms into horizontal and vertical forms. This proposal is appealing, since it is consistently equipped with a canonical braiding and exactness of the Atiyah sequence is guaranteed. Moreover, we provide examples of complete calculi, including the noncommutative 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and differential calculi on crossed product algebras.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of sigma models in two spacetime dimensions which are parameterized by an interaction function of one real variable. In addition to the physical group-valued field $g$, these models include an auxiliary vector field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every model in this family is weakly integrable, in the sense that the classical equations of motion are equivalent to flatness of a Lax connection for any value of a spectral parameter. We also show that these models are strongly integrable, in the sense that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, which guarantees the existence of an infinite set of conserved charges in involution. This class of theories includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor, such as $T \overline{T}$ and root-$T \overline{T}$.</description>

      <title>On existence of Sadovskii vortex patch: A touching pair of symmetric counter-rotating uniform vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sadovskii vortex patch is a traveling wave for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations consisting of an odd symmetric pair of vortex patches touching the symmetry axis. Its existence was first suggested by numerical computations of Sadovskii in [J. Appl. Math. Mech., 1971], and has gained significant interest due to its relevance in inviscid limit of planar flows via Prandtl--Batchelor theory and as the asymptotic state for vortex ring dynamics. In this work, we prove the existence of a Sadovskii vortex patch, by solving the energy maximization problem under the exact impulse condition and an upper bound on the circulation.</description>

      <title>Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.</description>

      <title>Global counterexamples to uniqueness for a Calder\'on problem with $C^k$ conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset R^n$, $n \geq 3$, be a fixed smooth bounded domain, and let $\gamma$ be a smooth conductivity in $\overline{\Omega}$. Consider a non-zero frequency $\lambda_0$ which does not belong to the Dirichlet spectrum of $L_\gamma = -{\rm div} (\gamma \nabla \cdot)$. Then, for all $k \geq 1$, there exists an infinite number of pairs of non-isometric $C^k$ conductivities $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ on $\overline{\Omega}$, which are close to $\gamma$ such that the associated DN maps at frequency $\lambda_0$ satisfy \begin{equation*}
  \Lambda_{\gamma_1,\lambda_0} = \Lambda_{\gamma_2,\lambda_0}. \end{equation*}</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Definition of Path Integrals on Symplectic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a mathematical definition of some path integrals, emphasizing those relevant to the quantization of symplectic manifolds (and more generally, Poisson manifolds) $\unicode{x2013}$ in particular, the coherent state path integral. We show that K\"{a}hler manifolds provide many computable examples and we emphasize those whose Bergman kernel is constant along the diagonal.</description>

      <title>Markovianity and non-Markovianity of Particle Bath with Dirac Dispersion Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay rate of quantum particles in open quantum systems has traditionally been known as exponential, based on empirical predictions from experiments and theoretical predictions from the Markovian dynamics of the corresponding quantum states. However, both theoretical predictions and experimental observations suggest deviations from this exponential decay, particularly in the short and long time regimes. In this study, we explore the spontaneous emission of a single Dirac particle within an environment characterized by an energy spectrum with a gap $m$ and an energy cutoff $L$. Our results reveal that high-energy structures, such as the spectral cutoff $L$, play a critical role in driving the short-time non-exponential decay. In contrast, the long-time decay is predominantly influenced by low-energy structures, such as the Dirac gap $m$. Surprisingly, we find that in the limits where the energy cutoff $L$ is infinite and the energy gap $m$ is zero, the decay dynamics of massless Dirac particles exhibit Markovian behavior without the need for conventional approximations like the Born-Markov approximation. This work underscores the complex interplay between particle energy properties and decay dynamics, providing new insights into quantum decay processes.</description>
