      <title>FollowGen: A Scaled Noise Conditional Diffusion Model for Car-Following Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for advancing autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Although deep learning-based approaches - especially those utilizing transformer-based and generative models - have markedly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex, non-linear patterns in vehicle dynamics and traffic interactions, they frequently overlook detailed car-following behaviors and the inter-vehicle interactions critical for real-world driving applications, particularly in fully autonomous or mixed traffic scenarios. To address the issue, this study introduces a scaled noise conditional diffusion model for car-following trajectory prediction, which integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a generative framework, improving both the accuracy and plausibility of predicted trajectories. The model utilizes a novel pipeline to capture historical vehicle dynamics by scaling noise with encoded historical features within the diffusion process. Particularly, it employs a cross-attention-based transformer architecture to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies, effectively guiding the denoising process and enhancing prediction accuracy. Experimental results on diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Enabling Adoption of Regenerative Agriculture through Soil Carbon Copilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16872v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigating climate change requires transforming agriculture to minimize environ mental impact and build climate resilience. Regenerative agricultural practices enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thus improving soil health and sequestering carbon. A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture practices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is affected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors and farm management practices. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex multi-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil health and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data (e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland information and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that integrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized analysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices across California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity may mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather conditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally, implementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants, policymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Power System Resilience to Extreme Weather Events Through Grid Enhancing Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change significantly increases risks to power systems, exacerbating issues such as aging infrastructure, evolving regulations, cybersecurity threats, and fluctuating demand. This paper focuses on the utilization of Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) to strengthen power system resilience in the face of extreme weather events. GETs are pivotal in optimizing energy distribution, enabling predictive maintenance, ensuring reliable electricity supply, facilitating renewable energy integration, and automating responses to power instabilities and outages. Drawing insights from resilience theory, the paper reviews recent grid resilience literature, highlighting increasing vulnerabilities due to severe weather events. It demonstrates how GETs are crucial in optimizing smart grid operations, thereby not only mitigating climate-related impacts but also promoting industrial transformation.

      <title>EvoChain: a Recovery Approach for Permissioned Blockchain Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology supports decentralized, consensus-driven data storage and processing, ensuring integrity and auditability. It is increasingly adopted for use cases with multiple stakeholders with shared ownership scenarios like digital identity and supply chain management. However, real-world deployments face challenges with mistakes and intrusions. This article presents EvoChain, a chaincode framework extension introducing controlled mutability for data redaction and recovery under time-limited or specific conditions. This mechanism allows corrections during a grace period before immutability takes effect. We validated our approach using WineTracker, a Hyperledger Fabric-based supply chain application. It enables some users to cancel unwanted operations while preserving the blockchain security and maintaining data consistency. Performance evaluations showed minimal overhead with functional benefits.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Storage And Self-Sovereign Identity For Document-Based Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Users increasingly rely on identity providers for accessing online services and resources. However, centralized identity systems often compromise user privacy due to online activity tracking or data breaches. At the same time, many online services require digital copies of physical documents for validation in claims processes, such as providing proof of residence for opening a bank account or verifying medical images for health insurance claims. With centralized solutions, privacy depends entirely on the trusted party, but there are emerging decentralized approaches that offer greater transparency.
  This article introduces SoverClaim, a decentralized application prototype that empowers users to control their identity and also allows them to present digital documents with privacy. SoverClaim leverages Hyperledger Indy, a blockchain for issuing and presenting self-sovereign digital identities with transparent audit logs, and Storj, a decentralized peer-to-peer service, for secure and decentralized document storage and subsequent deletion. The prototype demonstrates the seamless integration of self-sovereign identities and document-based claims, achieving response times of under 750 ms, making it suitable for timely human interactions.</description>

      <title>PIM-AI: A Novel Architecture for High-Efficiency LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in a variety of applications due to their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. However, their computational and memory requirements pose significant challenges to traditional hardware architectures. Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computational units directly into memory chips, offers several advantages for LLM inference, including reduced data transfer bottlenecks and improved power efficiency.
  This paper introduces PIM-AI, a novel DDR5/LPDDR5 PIM architecture designed for LLM inference without modifying the memory controller or DDR/LPDDR memory PHY. We have developed a simulator to evaluate the performance of PIM-AI in various scenarios and demonstrate its significant advantages over conventional architectures. In cloud-based scenarios, PIM-AI reduces the 3-year TCO per queries-per-second by up to 6.94x compared to state-of-the-art GPUs, depending on the LLM model used. In mobile scenarios, PIM-AI achieves a 10- to 20-fold reduction in energy per token compared to state-of-the-art mobile SoCs, resulting in 25 to 45~\% more queries per second and 6.9x to 13.4x less energy per query, extending battery life and enabling more inferences per charge.
  These results highlight PIM-AI's potential to revolutionize LLM deployments, making them more efficient, scalable, and sustainable.</description>

      <title>Metaverse Innovation Canvas: A Tool for Extended Reality Product/Service Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the factors contributing to the failure of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) startups in the emerging metaverse landscape. Through an in-depth analysis of 29 failed AR/VR startups from 2016 to 2022, key pitfalls were identified, such as a lack of scalability, poor usability, unclear value propositions, and the failure to address specific user problems. Grounded in these findings, we developed the Metaverse Innovation Canvas (MIC) a tailored business ideation framework for XR products and services. The canvas guides founders to define user problems, articulate unique XR value propositions, evaluate usability factors such as the motion-based interaction load, consider social/virtual economy opportunities, and plan for long term scalability. Unlike generalized models, specialized blocks prompt the consideration of critical XR factors from the outset. The canvas was evaluated through expert testing with startup consultants on five failed venture cases. The results highlighted the tool's effectiveness in surfacing overlooked usability issues and technology constraints upfront, enhancing the viability of future metaverse startups.</description>

      <title>ActSonic: Recognizing Everyday Activities from Inaudible Acoustic Wave Around the Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ActSonic, an intelligent, low-power active acoustic sensing system integrated into eyeglasses that can recognize 27 different everyday activities (e.g., eating, drinking, toothbrushing) from inaudible acoustic waves around the body. It requires only a pair of miniature speakers and microphones mounted on each hinge of the eyeglasses to emit ultrasonic waves, creating an acoustic aura around the body. The acoustic signals are reflected based on the position and motion of various body parts, captured by the microphones, and analyzed by a customized self-supervised deep learning framework to infer the performed activities on a remote device such as a mobile phone or cloud server. ActSonic was evaluated in user studies with 19 participants across 19 households to track its efficacy in everyday activity recognition. Without requiring any training data from new users (leave-one-participant-out evaluation), ActSonic detected 27 activities, achieving an average F1-score of 86.6% in fully unconstrained scenarios and 93.4% in prompted settings at participants' homes.</description>

      <title>SAIM: Scalable Analog Ising Machine for Solving Quadratic Binary Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a CMOS-compatible Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ)--based analog tile structure as a fundamental unit for developing scalable analog Ising machines (IMs). In the designed LHZ tile, the voltage-controlled oscillators are employed as the physical Ising spins, while for the ancillary spins, we introduce an oscillator-based circuit to emulate the constraint needed to ensure the correct functionality of the tile. We implement the proposed LHZ tile in 12nm FinFET technology using the Cadence Virtuoso. Simulation results show the proposed tile could converge to the results in about 31~ns. Also, the designed spins could operate at approximately 13~GHz.</description>
