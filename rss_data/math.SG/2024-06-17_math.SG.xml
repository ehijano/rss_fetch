      <title>Complex Symplectic Contractions and 3d Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose magnetic quivers for the complex-symplectic contraction spaces, which are related to implosions and have a natural interpretation in terms of the Moore-Tachikawa category. We use 3-d mirrors to provide computational checks.</description>

      <title>Families of four-dimensional integrable systems with $S^1$-symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give new insights about families of integrable systems lifting a Hamiltonian $S^1$-space. Specifically, we study one-parameter families $(M^4,\omega,F_t=(J,H_t))_{0 \leq t \leq 1}$ of systems with a fixed Hamiltonian $S^1$-space $(M,\omega,J)$ and which are semitoric for certain values of the parameter $t$, with a focus on such families in which one singular point undergoes a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation (also called nodal trade in the context of semitoric systems, and more generally almost toric fibrations). Beyond semitoric systems, we also study families containing hypersemitoric systems, and we investigate the local theory of a nodal trade.\\Building on and generalizing the ideas of a previous paper, we show how such families can be used to find explicit semitoric systems with certain desired invariants (bundled in the marked semitoric polygon). This allows us to make progress on the semitoric minimal model program by understanding and coming up with explicit systems for each strictly minimal type (i.e., those not admitting any toric or semitoric type blowdown). In order to obtain these systems, we develop strategies for constructing and understanding explicit examples of semitoric (and hypersemitoric) systems in general. One strategy we make use of is to start from a well-understood system (such as a toric system) and to explicitly induce Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcations to produce focus-focus singular points. This is an expanded version of the technique used in the aforementioned previous paper, in order to apply it to semitoric systems which include non-trivial isotropy spheres in the underlying $S^1$-space (i.e., $\mathbb{Z}_k$-spheres), which occurs in several of the strictly minimal systems.\\In particular, we give an explicit one-parameter family of systems on $\mathbb{CP}^2$ which transitions between being of toric type, semitoric type, and hypersemitoric type depending on the value of the parameter. We study this system at each stage, computing the marked semitoric polygon of the semitoric system and determining several properties of the hypersemitoric system, including the existence of a unique flap and two parabolic orbits. Furthermore, we study the transitions between these stages.\\We also come up with new explicit semitoric systems on all Hirzebruch surfaces which, together with the previous systems and the systems already contained in the literature, gives an explicit model for every type of strictly minimal system. Moreover, we show how to obtain every strictly minimal system by applying sequences of alternating toric type blowups and blowdowns to simple explicit systems. In particular, we obtain that every strictly minimal semitoric polygon can be obtained from a semitoric system which is part of a family $(M,\omega,F_t=(J,H_t))$ which is semitoric for all but a finite number of values of $t$, called a semitoric family.</description>

      <title>Partial separability and symplectic-Haantjes manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of partial separability for classical Hamiltonian systems is proposed in the context of Haantjes geometry.
  As a general result, we show that the knowledge of a non-semisimple symplectic-Haantjes manifold for a given Hamiltonian system is sufficient to construct sets of coordinates (called Darboux-Haantjes coordinates) which allow both the partial separability of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equations and the block-diagonalization of the operators of the corresponding Haantjes algebra.
  We also introduce a novel class of Hamiltonian systems, characterized by the existence of a generalized St\"ackel matrix, which by construction are partially separable. They widely generalize the known families of partially separable Hamiltonian systems. Our systems can be described in terms of semisimple but non-maximal-rank symplectic-Haantjes manifolds.</description>

      <title>Strong generalized holomorphic principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a strong generalized holomorphic (SGH) fiber bundle and develop connection and curvature theory for an SGH principal $G$-bundle over a regular generalized complex (GC) manifold, where $G$ is a complex Lie group. We develop a de Rham cohomology for regular GC manifolds, and a Dolbeault cohomology for SGH vector bundles. Moreover, we establish a Chern-Weil theory for SGH principal $G$-bundles under certain mild assumptions on the leaf space of the GC structure. We also present a Hodge theory along with associated dualities and vanishing theorems for SGH vector bundles. Several examples of SGH fiber bundles are given.</description>

      <title>Modified double brackets and a conjecture of S. Arthamonov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Around 20 years ago, M. Van den Bergh introduced double Poisson brackets as operations on associative algebras inducing Poisson brackets under the representation functor. Weaker versions of these operations, called modified double Poisson brackets, were later introduced by S. Arthamonov in order to induce a Poisson bracket on moduli spaces of representations of the corresponding associative algebras. Moreover, he defined two operations that he conjectured to be modified double Poisson brackets. The first case of this conjecture was recently proved by M. Goncharov and V. Gubarev motivated by the theory of Rota-Baxter operators of nonzero weight. We settle the conjecture by realising the second case as part of a new family of modified double Poisson brackets.</description>
