      <title>JAX-in-Cell: A Differentiable Particle-in-Cell Code for Plasma Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JAX-in-Cell is a fully electromagnetic, multispecies, and relativistic 1D3V Particle-in-Cell (PIC) framework implemented entirely in JAX. It provides a modern, Python-based alternative to traditional PIC frameworks. It leverages Just-In-Time compilation and automatic vectorization to achieve the performance of traditional compiled codes on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. The resulting framework bridges the gap between educational scripts and production codes, providing a testbed for differentiable physics and AI integration that enables end-to-end gradient-based optimization. The code solves the Vlasov-Maxwell system on a staggered Yee lattice with either periodic, reflective, or absorbing boundary conditions, allowing both an explicit Boris solver and an implicit Crank-Nicolson method via Picard iteration to ensure energy conservation. Here, we detail the numerical methods employed, validate against standard benchmarks, and showcase the use of its auto-differentiation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Large Errors in Kinetic Temperature Measurements Using Particle Tracking Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on random errors in kinetic temperature measurements due to position uncertainty in particle tracking velocimetry. Using simulated data, we isolate the effects of spatial resolution and the frame rate on particle velocity calculations. A sample of particle velocities is generated from a Maxwellian distribution at a known temperature. Particle positions are assigned randomly and roughened to match a prescribed spatial resolution. Velocities are restored using the two-frame tracking method, and the kinetic temperature is calculated. By repeating this procedure, we obtain the discrepancy as a function of the spatial resolution and frame rate. Results show that, under typical experimental conditions, the restored kinetic temperature can deviate significantly from the true value, with spatial resolution playing a more dominant role than the frame rate.</description>

      <title>Charged particle energization by low-amplitude electrostatic waves at cyclotron harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system made by a charged particle interacting with a single electrostatic wave which propagates perpendicularly to the magnetic field, at a frequency larger than the cyclotron one, has been extensively studied in literature due to its implications with ion heating in magnetized plasmas. It is known that a threshold in the electrostatic potential must be exceeded in order for stochastic particle motion and heating to occur. Regardless its amplitude, however, the electrostatic wave induces a periodic oscillation in the particle motion. We show, by analytical and numerical arguments, that this dynamics is non-adiabatic, meaning that the particle does not land back to its initial state when the wave is slowly turned off. This way, particle energization (although, not rigorously heating) occurs even under sub-threshold conditions.</description>

      <title>Residual energy in weakly compressible turbulence with a mean guide field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy distribution is a fundamental property of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. In strongly magnetized turbulence energy imbalances can arise, quantified by the so-called residual energy: $E_r~=~(E_{kin}~ - ~E_{mag})$; $E_{kin}$ and $E_{mag}$ stand for the volume-averaged kinetic and magnetic energy, respectively. Numerical simulations of incompressible turbulence yield $E_r &lt; 0$, which is consistent with Solar wind observations, while in highly compressible turbulence simulations $E_r &gt; $ 0. Differences arise in the cascade of $E_r$ between the two regimes. We explore the properties of $E_r$ in weakly compressible MHD turbulence in the presence of an initially strong (guide) magnetic field. We study the influence of different driving mechanisms and field strengths on the cascade of $E_r$. We run a suite of direct numerical simulations with the PENCIL code. All simulations are maintained through forcing in a quasi-static regime with sonic Mach numbers close to 0.1. We solely change the Alfv\'en Mach number, or equivalently the plasma beta ($\beta$) of the simulations. We drive turbulence by either injecting velocity or magnetic fluctuations at large scales and study the power spectra of kinetic, magnetic, density, and $E_r$. Magnetically-driven simulations show locally imbalanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations and a $\propto k^{-3/2}$ cascade, consistent with the dynamic alignment theory. Kinetically-driven simulations give rise to a $\propto k^{-1}$ scaling, consistent with interactions between Alfv\'en waves scattered by density inhomogeneities -- a hallmark of reflection-driven turbulence. Residual energy is positive with a spectral slope ($\alpha$) depending on $\beta$ as: for $\beta = 4.0$, $-2 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -5/3$, for $\beta = 1.0$, $-5/3 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -3/2$, and for $\beta = 0.3$, $\alpha \approx -1$.</description>

      <title>Reconnection-Driven Turbulent Fluctuations in the Magnetically Dominated Collisionless Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental plasma process that converts magnetic energy into bulk flow energy, thermal energy, and nonthermal particle acceleration. Despite its importance, the statistical properties of the turbulent fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection, which are essential for understanding how this energy conversion proceeds, remain poorly understood. Here, we employ large-scale 3D particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the turbulence characteristics of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations generated by collisionless reconnection in a magnetically dominated plasma. We characterize their statistical properties by computing structure functions along different directions within the reconnection layer. We find that the square root of the second-order velocity structure function follows a power-law scaling with a slope near $\sim1/3$ at intermediate to large scales, consistent with Kolmogorov-like turbulence, a behavior robust along the inflow, outflow, and guide-field directions. The square root of the second-order magnetic structure function consistently exhibits a steeper slope, in the range $\sim 0.6 - 0.8$. The presence of a finite guide field does not systematically modify the slope of the velocity fluctuations, while it progressively steepens the scaling of the magnetic fluctuations in the guide-field and inflow directions. We also measure higher-order structure functions, which reveal strong magnetic intermittency along the outflow direction and weaker intermittency in the inflow and guide-field directions. In addition, the local anisotropies of both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations are greater for stronger guide fields. These results provide a first systematic characterization of the multiscale nature of turbulence in collisionless reconnection layers, with important implications for plasma heating and particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>What are Switchbacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solitary Alfv\'en wave model that exhibits nontrivial three-dimensional twisting of open magnetic field lines while preserving constant $|B|$. Embedded rotational discontinuities sharply deflect the otherwise uniform field lines, producing localized, large-amplitude field reversals in one-dimensional profiles that closely resemble the ``switchbacks'' observed by the Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. This indicates that switchbacks, as seen in one-dimensional spacecraft time series, arise from traversals through strongly curved segments of open magnetic field lines.</description>

      <title>Laser Wakefield Acceleration in a Capillary Gas Cell Producing GeV-Scale High-Quality Electron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) is a promising approach for producing high-brightness electron beams in the GeV energy range, offering significant potential for compact next-generation accelerator facilities. In this work, we present a computational study of LWFA in a specially designed single-stage capillary gas-cell target aimed at producing high-quality, GeV-class electron beams. The capillary cell includes a short (~2 mm) injection region at the entrance filled with a helium (He) and nitrogen (N2 ) gas mixture. This is followed by a longer (~12 mm) pure He section, which provides the required acceleration length and limits continuous ionization injection, thereby significantly reducing the energy spread of the accelerated beam. Hydrodynamic simulations are performed to optimize the capillary geometry and generate the required two-section gas-pressure profile. The resulting gas-density distributions for various cases are then directly incorporated in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study LWFA. In particular, our hydrodynamic simulations demonstrate how tailored density profiles with longitudinal density tapering in the acceleration section can be realized in a capillary gas cell, while the corresponding PIC simulations reveal how these profiles influence the acceleration process and the resulting beam quality. Using a 100 TW-class laser system with parameters relevant to the L2-DUHA laser at the ELI Beamlines Facility, the PIC results demonstrate electron acceleration to mean energies exceeding 1.0 GeV with high-quality beam properties. Self-injected He electrons are also observed, and their impact on the main beam quality is evaluated. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for upcoming LWFA experiments planned within the EuPRAXIA Project at the ELI Beamlines Facility.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Particle Energy Gain During Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The factors that control the maximum energy attained by protons and electrons during magnetic reconnection are investigated analytically and using large-scale simulations with the \textit{kglobal} model. Previous work revealed that a strong ambient guide field strongly impacts particle energy gain during reconnection, suppressing energy gain from Fermi reflection by increasing the radius of curvature of reconnected field lines. However, previous simulations have also shown that the maximum energy gain increases with the system size. The physical basis for this result has not been explored. We perform simulations that vary the effective system size over a large range to isolate the processes determining the maximum energy gain. The maximum energy $W_{max}$ is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur, as multiple flux ropes that form at early time repeatedly merge until the largest approaches the system scale. Fermi reflection in these repeated mergers dominates particle energy gain. The number of mergers is linked to the effective system size -- larger systems produce a larger number of flux ropes and more mergers. That $W_{max}$ is linked to the number of flux rope mergers has implications for understanding why particle-in-cell simulations only produce powerlaw distributions of energetic particles with a limited range in energy.</description>

      <title>Hollow Beam Optical Ponderomotive Trap for Ultracold Neutral Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly oscillating, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field from laser exert a force that repels charged particles from regions of high light intensity. We propose and analyze a flat-bottomed hollow-beam ponderomotive optical trap for an ultracold neutral plasma (UNP), driven by a high-power CO$_2$ laser. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the plasma and Rydberg atoms are effectively trapped within a nearly uniform dark region bounded by repulsive light walls. In contrast to RF traps, flat-bottomed traps yield a small density-weighted mean ponderomotive energy per electron, while the UNP collision frequency is far below the laser frequency, thereby making collisional absorption negligible and does not limit the lifetime of the trap. This approach could enhance antimatter production and storage.</description>

      <title>Probing Proton versus Electron Heating and Energization during Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanisms controlling the relative heating and energization of electrons and protons during magnetic reconnection are explored. Simulations are carried out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since the protons counterstream at the Alfv\'en speed $C_A$ while the initial electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$. Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that of electrons.</description>
