      <title>Modification of Newtonian Gravity: Implications for Hot Gas in Clusters and Galactic Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the negative results from various dark matter detection experiments, we had earlier proposed an alternate theoretical framework through Modification of Newtonian Gravity (MONG). Here, the Poison's equation is modified by introducing an additional gravitational self-energy density term along with the usual dark energy density term. In this work we extend this model to account for the presence of low-density gas at high temperatures (10^8 K) in the intra cluster medium (ICM) by estimating the velocities to which particles will be subjected by the modified gravitational force. Considering that the ICM is under the influence of the cluster's gravity, particle velocities of the ions in the ICM must be balanced by the cluster's gravitational force. The particle velocities obtained for various clusters from their temperature profiles match the velocity produced by the MONG gravitational force. Thus, the increase in the gravitational potential at the outskirts of galaxies balances the thermal pressure of the ICM, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium without invoking DM. The effect of MONG on the angular momentum of galaxies is also studied by obtaining a scaling relation between the angular momentum and the mass of a galaxy. MONG predicts a higher dependence on mass in comparison to the \Lambda-CDM model. This increased dependence on mass compensates for the halo contribution to the angular momentum. The angular momentum from MONG for galaxies from the SPARC database is compared to the halo angular momentum by a Chi-square fit technique. The correlation coefficient is found to be unity, showing a replicable result.</description>

      <title>Kiloparsec-scale turbulence driven by reionization may grow intergalactic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intergalactic medium (IGM) underwent intense heating that resulted in pressure disequilibrium in the wake of ionization fronts during cosmic reionization. The dynamical relaxation to restore pressure balance may have driven small-scale turbulence and, hence, the amplification of intergalactic magnetic fields. We investigate this possibility using a suite of $\approx 100$ pc resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of IGM gas dynamics. We show that as the spatial resolution improves beyond that achieved with most prior studies, much of the IGM becomes turbulent unless it was pre-heated to $\gg 100~$K before reionization. In our most turbulent simulations, we find that the gas energy spectrum follows the expected $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov scaling to the simulation's resolution, and the eddy turnover time of the turbulence is $&lt; 1$ Gyr at $k \approx 1 ~$kpc$^{-1}$. Turbulence will grow magnetic fields, and we show that the fields grown by reionization-driven turbulence could explain lower limits on IGM B-field strengths from observations of TeV blazars.</description>

      <title>Cosmological-model independent limits on photon mass from FRB and SNe data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic emissions from astrophysical sources at cosmological distances can be used to estimate the photon mass, $m_{\gamma}$. In this paper, we combine measurements of the dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}$) of fast radio bursts (FRB) with the luminosity distance from type Ia supernovae (SNe) to investigate update constraints on the photon rest mass. We derive the expression of $\mathrm{DM}$ dependence concerning a non-vanishing photon mass from a cosmological-model independent approach and constrain the parameter $m_{\gamma}$ from measurements of 68 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe data from the Pantheon compilation. We consider two scenarios for the baryon fraction in the intergalactic medium ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$): one where the value is fixed according to recent reports and another where it is treated as a free parameter, $f_{\mathrm{IGM}} = f_{\mathrm{IGM,0}}$. In the latter case, we find $m_{\gamma} = (29.4_{-15.5}^{+5.80}) \times 10^{-51}$ kg, at $1\sigma$ level. Our results also demonstrate an anticorrelation between $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ and $m_{\gamma}$, which highlights the importance of analyzing a larger sample of FRBs for a more comprehensive understanding of their properties.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model for Covariance Matrices of the 2-, 3-, and 4-Point Correlation Functions in the Gaussian Random Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of the galaxy N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs) have a large number of degrees of freedom, meaning one cannot directly estimate an invertible covariance matrix purely from mock catalogs, as has been the standard approach for the 2PCF and power spectrum. Instead, analyses use templates based on assuming a Gaussian Random Field density with the true, Boltzmann-solver-computed power spectrum. The resulting covariance matrices are sparse but have notable internal structure. To understand this structure better, we seek a fully analytic, closed-form covariance matrix template, using a power law power spectrum $P(k) \propto 1/k$. We obtain a simple closed-form solution for the covariance of the 2PCF, as well as closed-form solutions for the fundamental building blocks of the covariance matrices for the 3PCF, 4PCF, and beyond. We use our results to present a clearer picture of the covariance matrices' structure and sparsity, corresponding to triangular and non-triangular regions. This will be useful in guiding future NPCF analyses with spectroscopic surveys such as DESI, Euclid, Roman, and SPHEREx.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy in the Crosshairs: A Joint Analysis with DESI, Pantheon plus, and TDCOSMO Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological tensions between early- and late-Universe probes, particularly the Hubble tension ($H_0$) and $S_8$ discrepancy, challenge the validity of the standard ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$ model. Motivated by these tensions, we perform a comprehensive joint analysis of three representative dark energy models - ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and the Phenomenologically Emergent Dark Energy (PEDE) model - using the latest observational datasets: baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Releases 1 and 2 (DR1/DR2), the Pantheon Plus sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and time-delay cosmography from TDCOSMO lensing. Our multi-probe approach breaks key degeneracies among cosmological parameters ($H_0$, $r_d$, and $M_B$) and provides robust constraints on dark energy dynamics. The CPL model yields a statistically significant improvement over ${\rm{\Lambda}CDM}$, with $\Delta \chi^2 \approx -3.6$ for DESI DR2+Pantheon Plus+TDCOSMO, favoring a quintessence-like behavior ($w_0=-0.87^{+0.045 }_{-0.045} $, $w_a=-0.41^{+ 0.28}_{-0.28}$ at 1$\sigma$ confidence level). In contrast, the PEDE model exhibits severe tension with observations, yielding $\Delta \chi^2 \approx +53.1$ (DR1) and $\Delta \chi^2 \approx +132.3$ (DR2), despite its potential to marginally alleviate the $H_0$ tension. DESI DR2 tightens constraints on dynamical dark energy by $\sim$40\%, reinforcing evidence for redshift-evolving $w(z)$. Remarkably, our results demonstrate that such data combination can achieve precision comparable to Planck CMB measurements for dynamical dark energy studies, while offering complementary advantages in probing the late-time universe. This synergy between different observational data significantly enhances our ability to constrain dark energy properties.</description>

      <title>Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with various data sets and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. Further, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is one of the most fundamental questions in cosmology. Using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN) and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of the evolution of dark matter in the dynamical dark matter (DDM) model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Based on CMB data, we find a very strong linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing the single-parameter DDM model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm}a$, where the $\sim2\,\sigma$ DDM evidences is well captured and even strengthened. We demonstrate that there are beyond $2\,\sigma$ evidences of the coexistence of DDM and dynamical dark energy using the combinations of CMB, DESI BAO and Pantheon+ SN data. In such models, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we verify that the universe remains in a matter-dominated state for a substantial period in the past, accelerate in the distant future and finally becomes completely dominated by dark matter. We propose that the ultimate fate of the universe is the ``Super Rip'' induced by dark matter with an extremely negative pressure. Our findings fundamentally challenge the prevailing understanding of cosmic acceleration and deepen our insight into the universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cosmological Constraints by Two-dimensional $\beta$-cosmic-web Weighted Angular Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of $\beta$-cosmic-web weighted angular correlation functions to improve the cosmological constraints. Using SDSS DR12 CMASS-NGC galaxies and simulated mock catalogs with $\Omega_m$ varying in the range of 0.25-0.40, we quantify the discriminative power of different statistics via $\Delta \chi^2$ measurements. Our results demonstrate significant improvements when incorporating weighted statistics. Especially, adding the $\bar{D}_{\rm nei}$-weighting statistics enhances $\Delta \chi^2$ by 39%-130%, while adding the $1/\bar{D}_{\rm nei}$-weighted statistics yields 229%-336% gains over solely using the traditional angular statistics. These findings align with 3D correlation function studies \cite{Yin+etal+2024}, confirming the superior performance of $\beta$-cosmic-web weighted statistics. The thin-redshift-slice approach makes our method particularly relevant for slitless surveys (such as Euclid, CSST) where redshift errors challenge traditional 3D analyses. This work also establishes the first theoretical framework for marked statistics in 2D angular clustering.</description>

      <title>Turning a negative neutrino mass into a positive optical depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under $\Lambda$CDM, recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures from DESI, which favor a low matter density $\Omega_m$, are in moderate $2-3\sigma$ tension with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. This tension appears alternately as a preference for the sum of neutrino masses dropping below the $\sum m_\nu = 0.06$eV value required by neutrino oscillation measurements to formally negative values; a discrepant value of $\Omega_m$ at 0.06eV; or preference for dynamical dark energy beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We show that this tension largely arises from the CMB lensing constraints on the calibration of the sound horizon for geometric measurements and relies on the measurement of the reionization optical depth $\tau$ from large-angle CMB polarization to set the lensing amplitude. Dropping these constraints removes the neutrino tension at $\sum m_\nu=0.06$eV entirely, favoring $\tau = 0.091\pm 0.011$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Beyond $\Lambda$CDM, it brings the preference for $w_0-w_a$ dynamical dark energy to below $95\%$ CL. We explore the freedom in interpreting the low-$\ell$ EE polarization constraint due to analysis choices and reionization modeling beyond the standard step-function assumption and find that this drops the neutrino tension in $\Lambda$CDM to below $95\%$ CL. Alternately, this raising of $\tau$ can also be achieved by the same reduction in large-scale curvature fluctuations that also ameliorates the low-$\ell$ temperature anomaly.</description>

      <title>Recoherence, adiabaticiy and Markovianity in Gaussian maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of situations where cosmological fluctuations recohere during inflation, we investigate the relationship between quantum recoherence (late-time purification after a transient phase of decoherence), adiabaticity, and Markovianity. To that end, we study a simple setup of two linearly-coupled harmonic oscillators, and compute the purity of one oscillator when the interaction is switched off. We find that there exists a critical value for the coupling strength below which the purity oscillates and above which it decays exponentially. This decay cannot be captured with perturbation theory, hence, decoherence is always a non-perturbative phenomenon. When the interaction is turned off, the purity either freezes to its value prior to the turn-off, or it smoothly goes back to a value very close to one (recoherence). This depends on the rate at which the turn-off occurs. We thus develop a new adiabatic-expansion scheme and find complete recoherence at any finite order in the inverse turn-off time. Therefore, decoherence is always a non-adiabatic effect. The critical value of the turn-off time above which recoherence takes place is then expressed in terms of the other time scales of the problem. Finally, we show that even though the dynamics of the system is never Markovian, when decoherence takes place, it can always be interpreted as resulting from a locally Markovian process. We introduce a new measure of Markovianity dubbed the Bures velocity and use it to optimise Markovian approximations.</description>

Abstract: We suggest that a gauge theory CP-violating phase could be degenerate with a magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux. Discrete discharge of this flux by membrane nucleations could reduce the total CP-violating phase to below $10^{-10}$ well before BBN if the charge and the tension of the membranes are in the $\sim keV$ range.</description>

      <title>The frozen vanilla model: Exploring dark sector interactions with delta effective theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new interacting mechanism within the dark sector, encompassing both dark energy and dark matter, while grounding our analysis in the familiar framework of the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ model augmented by baryons and radiation components, including photons and neutrinos. The interaction between dark energy and dark matter is confined to the perturbative level. One significant advantage of this proposal is that all geometric probes yield constraints consistent with the so-called vanilla model or the extended vanilla model, where dark energy has a constant equation of state, $w_{x}$. However, the introduction of this new interacting mechanism affects several theoretical signatures, involving contrast dark matter and dark energy densities. We perform an exploratory analysis of those effects in the CMB power spectra, matter-power spectra, and redshift space distortions. For instance, it allows for a decrease/increment in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect depending on the value taken by the interaction coupling. This effect could be observationally detected by looking for a cross-correlation between the ISW temperature fluctuations and the distribution of galaxies or quasars. At late times, the interaction in the dark sector becomes very effective, affecting the non-linear scale of structure formation. We discuss how the estimators $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ and $S_{8}(z)$ are affected by different interacting couplings; indicating that $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ can show a relative change of up to $15\%$ compared to the concordance model at low redshifts. Finally, we show how the various terms in the dark energy pressure perturbation (both adiabatic and non-adiabatic) are relevant for different scales, demonstrating the absence of large-scale instabilities.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition and Bubble Wall Velocity in Local Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the electroweak phase transition in the early universe has profound implications for cosmology and particle physics. We systematically study the steady-state dynamics of bubble walls in scenarios where the transition is first order within three representative beyond the Standard Model frameworks, characterised by the presence of an additional scalar in different electroweak representations. Focusing on the local thermal equilibrium regime, we numerically solve the coupled scalar and hydrodynamic equations to extract key properties of the phase transition front: the wall velocity, width, plasma and field profiles. Remarkably, we find a near-universal behaviour across models when expressed in terms of thermodynamic quantities, that can be captured by simple fitting functions, useful for phenomenological applications. These results also provide an upper bound on the bubble velocity and represent the first necessary step for the full inclusion of out-of-equilibrium effects.</description>

      <title>Towards model-independent identification of lensed gravitational waves using Kramers-Kronig relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of microlensed gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are essential for studying the mass density distribution in the universe, including black holes and dark matter halos. However, no confident detection of microlensed GWs have been reported to date. There are two important challenges in the identification of microlensed GWs. The first is that the source waveform and lens structure models are not known a-priori. The second is that certain classes of unlensed GWs could mimic microlensed GWs, resulting in undesirable false alarms. In this work, we propose to use the Kramers-Kronig relation for gravitational lensing systems. We argue that such systems are essentially linear response systems obeying causality, where KK relation must hold. The power of this method lies in the fact that microlensed GWs, regardless of the lens structure, must obey KK relation, while unlensed GW events are not in general expected to obey it. This, in principle, allows us to identify microlensed GWs while dismissing microlensing mimickers. We provide the first important steps towards a methodology that exploits KK relation, and test its usefulness under idealized conditions.</description>

      <title>Plausible Indication of Gamma-Ray Absorption by Dark Matter in NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 1068 is the brightest extragalactic source in high-energy neutrinos as seen by IceCube, yet the accompanying gamma-ray flux is orders of magnitude weaker. It has been argued that this indicates that the bulk of neutrinos and gamma rays are emitted in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole, which is transparent to neutrinos, but opaque to gamma rays. Even in such extreme scenarios for the acceleration of cosmic rays, astrophysical models typically overestimate the low-energy gamma-ray flux and/or require some fine-tuning in the physical parameters. Here we suggest instead that the dark matter surrounding the supermassive black hole may absorb the gamma rays, inducing the observed deficit. We show that for a dark matter-photon scattering cross section in the range $\sigma_{\rm DM-\gamma}/m_{\rm DM} \simeq 10^{-28}-10^{-30}$ cm$^2$/GeV, Fermi-LAT measurements can be well reconciled with IceCube data. We also present some simple particle physics examples that achieve the correct spectral energy dependence while respecting complementary constraints.</description>

      <title>Accretion inside astrophysical objects : Effects of rotation and viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-solar mass black holes could show up in gravitational observations in future and near-solar mass black holes might have been involved in the events GW190425 and GW190814. Since they cannot form from the stellar evolution, their creation requires exotic mechanisms. One such mechanism involves the capture of dark matter particles by stellar objects and their thermalization. When the criterion for the collapse of these dark matter particles is satisfied, a tiny endoparasitic black hole (EBH) forms and then it accretes matter from the host. The EBH may transmute the host into a black hole of nearly the same mass as the host or lesser, depending on the type of accretion. We examine this complex and poorly explored accretion mechanism, considering the effects of rotation and viscosity but ignoring some other effects, such as those of pressure and magnetic field, as the first step. Using a general framework to assess the effects of rotation and viscosity on accretion, we show that the accretion could be stalled in some white dwarfs, but not in neutron stars. The stalled accretion should cause an opening in the host's polar regions, the extent of which depends on the mass and spin of the host.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings in LISA: reconstruction pipeline and physics interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the LISA template databank for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds sourced by cosmic strings. We include two templates, an analytical template, which enables more flexible searches, and a numerical template derived directly from large Nambu-Goto simulations of string networks. Using searches based on these templates, we forecast the parameter space within the reach of the experiment and the precision with which their parameters will be reconstructed, provided a signal is observed. The reconstruction permits probing the Hubble expansion and new relativistic DoF in the early universe. We quantify the impact that astrophysical foregrounds can have on these searches. Finally, we discuss the impact that these observations would have on our understanding of the fundamental models behind the string networks. Overall, we prove that LISA has great potential for probing cosmic string models and may reach tensions as low as $G\mu =10^{-16} - 10^{-17} $, which translates into energy scales of the order $10^{11}~\text{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a modified-gravity model with an exponential function of the curvature using the expansion history, the RSD, and the Pantheon+SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a well-motivated $f(R)$ modified-gravity model, in which an exponential function of the curvature is included, in this paper we implement a statistical data analysis to set constraints on the parameters of the model, taking into account an analytic approximate solution for the expansion rate, $H(z)$. Using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain-based analysis of the expansion rate evolution, the standardized SN distance modulus and the redshift space distortion observational data, we find that the preferred value for the perturbative parameter, $b$, quantifying the deviation of the $f(R)$ model from $\Lambda$CDM, lies in a region that excludes $b = 0$ at $\gtrsim 3.5 \sigma$ C.L., and that the predicted current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, locates in between the two observational results currently under scrutiny from Planck and SH0ES collaborations. Under the implemented approximate solution, and with the constraints obtained for the parameters, the proposed $f(R)$ model successfully reproduces the observational data and the predicted evolution of interesting cosmological parameters resemble the results of $\Lambda$CDM, as expected, while an oscillatory behavior of the dark energy equation of state is observed, pointing to deviation from the concordance cosmological model. The results presented here reinforce the conclusion that the $f(R)$ modified-gravity model represents a viable alternative to describe the evolution of the Universe, avoiding the challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>DESI Peculiar Velocity Survey -- Fundamental Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Peculiar Velocity Survey aims to measure the peculiar velocities of early and late type galaxies within the DESI footprint using both the Fundamental Plane and optical Tully-Fisher relations. Direct measurements of peculiar velocities can significantly improve constraints on the growth rate of structure, reducing uncertainty by a factor of approximately 2.5 at redshift 0.1 compared to the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey's redshift space distortion measurements alone. We assess the quality of stellar velocity dispersion measurements from DESI spectroscopic data. These measurements, along with photometric data from the Legacy Survey, establish the Fundamental Plane relation and determine distances and peculiar velocities of early-type galaxies. During Survey Validation, we obtain spectra for 6698 unique early-type galaxies, up to a photometric redshift of 0.15. 64\% of observed galaxies (4267) have relative velocity dispersion errors below 10\%. This percentage increases to 75\% if we restrict our sample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts below 0.1. We use the measured central velocity dispersion, along with photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, to fit the Fundamental Plane parameters using a 3D Gaussian maximum likelihood algorithm that accounts for measurement uncertainties and selection cuts. In addition, we conduct zero-point calibration using the absolute distance measurements to the Coma cluster, leading to a value of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.05 \pm 0.35$(statistical) $\pm 0.49$(systematic FP) $\pm 4.86$(statistical due to calibration) $\mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. This $H_0$ value is within $2\sigma$ of Planck Cosmic Microwave Background results and within $1\sigma$, of other low redshift distance indicator-based measurements.</description>

      <title>StratLearn-z: Improved photo-$z$ estimation from spectroscopic data subject to selection effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A precise measurement of photometric redshifts (photo-z) is key for the success of modern photometric galaxy surveys. Machine learning (ML) methods show great promise in this context, but suffer from covariate shift (CS) in training sets due to selection bias where interesting sources are underrepresented, and the corresponding ML models show poor generalisation properties. We present an application of the StratLearn method to the estimation of photo-z, validating against simulations where we enforce the presence of CS to different degrees. StratLearn is a statistically principled approach that relies on splitting the source and target datasets into strata based on estimated propensity scores (i.e. the probability for an object to be in the source set given its observed covariates). After stratification, two conditional density estimators are fit separately to each stratum, then combined via a weighted average. We benchmark our results against the GPz algorithm, quantifying the performance of the two codes with a set of metrics. Our results show that the StratLearn-z metrics are only marginally affected by the presence of CS, while GPz shows a significant degradation of performance in the photo-z prediction for fainter objects. For the strongest CS scenario, StratLearn-z yields a reduced fraction of catastrophic errors, a factor of 2 improvement for the RMSE and one order of magnitude improvement on the bias. We also assess the quality of the conditional redshift estimates with the probability integral transform (PIT). The PIT distribution obtained from StratLearn-z features fat fewer outliers and is symmetric, i.e. the predictions appear to be centered around the true redshift value, despite showing a conservative estimation of the spread of the conditional redshift distributions. Our julia implementation of the method is available at https://github.com/chiaramoretti/StratLearn-z.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Dark Matter Annihilation and Dark Matter-Baryon Velocity Offsets at Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter annihilation has the potential to leave an imprint on the properties of the first luminous structures at Cosmic Dawn as well as the overall evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we employ a semi-analytic method to model dark matter annihilation during Cosmic Dawn (approximately redshift $z=20$ to $40$), examining potential modifications to IGM evolution as well as gas collapse, cooling, and star formation in mini-halos. Our analysis takes into account the effects of dark matter-baryon velocity offsets, utilizing the public 21cmvFAST code, and producing predictions for the 21cm global signal. The results from our simplified model suggest that dark matter annihilation can suppress the gas fraction in small halos and alter the molecular cooling process, while the impact on star formation might be positive or negative depending on parameters of the dark matter model as well as the redshift and assumptions about velocity offsets. This underscores the need for more comprehensive simulations of the effects of exotic energy injection at Cosmic Dawn as observational probes are providing us new insights into the process of reionization and the formation of first stars and galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since the Planck satellite measured the the cosmic microwave background (CMB) down to arcminute angular scales, the mismatch between the CMB-inferred value of the Hubble constant and the value inferred from the distance ladder (i.e., the Hubble tension) has been a growing concern and is currently at the $\sim 6 \sigma$ level. There are a handful of proposed mechanisms operating in the early universe which have shown some promise in resolving the Hubble tension. These mechanisms are expected to leave a measurable impact on the smallest scale CMB anisotropy, deep in the damping tail. Using current CMB data, baryonic acoustic oscillation data, and the luminosities of Type Ia supernovae as a baseline, we compute the predicted small-scale CMB power spectra for a characteristic set of these models. We find that near-future CMB data should be able to distinguish some but not all of the investigated models from the core cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of DESI DR2 BAO measurements in light of the latest ACT DR6 CMB data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report cosmological results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) when combined with recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). By jointly analyzing ACT and Planck data and applying conservative cuts to overlapping multipole ranges, we assess how different Planck+ACT dataset combinations affect consistency with DESI. While ACT alone exhibits a tension with DESI exceeding 3$\sigma$ within the $\Lambda$CDM model, this discrepancy is reduced when ACT is analyzed in combination with Planck. For our baseline DESI DR2 BAO+Planck PR4+ACT likelihood combination, the preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant is about 3$\sigma$, increasing to over 4$\sigma$ with the inclusion of Type Ia supernova data. While the dark energy results remain quite consistent across various combinations of Planck and ACT likelihoods with those obtained by the DESI collaboration, the constraints on neutrino mass are more sensitive, ranging from $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.061$ eV in our baseline analysis, to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.077$ eV (95\% confidence level) in the CMB likelihood combination chosen by ACT when imposing the physical prior $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$ eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an emergent cosmological model rooted in the Asymptotically Safe antiscreening behavior of the Newton constant at Planckian energies. Distinguishing itself from prior approaches, our model encapsulates the variable nature of $G$ through a multiplicative coupling within the matter Lagrangian, characterized by a conserved energy-momentum tensor. The universe emerges from a quasi-de Sitter phase, transitioning to standard cosmological evolution post-Planck Era. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constraining the transition scale to nearly classical cosmology using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the potential to empirically probe the antiscreening trait of Newton's constant, as predicted by Asymptotic Safety.</description>

      <title>Circularly Polarized Gravitational Wave Background Search with a Network of Space-borne Triangular Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized gravitational wave backgrounds are predicted in many well-motivated models of inflation and phase transitions involving spontaneous parity violation. In this work, we investigate the detection of such parity-violating signals with the network of two space-borne triangular detectors. We derive the general analytical formula for the overlap reduction functions of networks composed of two triangular detectors, by exploiting the system's symmetrical properties under the long-wave approximation. Based on these results, we further assess the detectability of a parity-violating background with alternative LISA-Taiji network configurations. We find that the sensitivity to the parity-violating component can be significantly enhanced at low frequencies by adjusting the orientation of Taiji's constellation plane. This sensitivity gain is approximately an order of magnitude around the millihertz band, making the peak sensitivity comparable to that of the total intensity. This provides a promising opportunity to constrain various parity-violating theories in the millihertz band with upcoming space-borne detectors.</description>

Abstract: The detection of artificial satellite thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths is presented using data from the 3rd-Generation receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G). This represents the first reported detection of thermal emission from artificial satellites at millimeter wavelengths. Satellite thermal emission is shown to be detectable at high signal-to-noise ratios on timescales as short as a few tens of milliseconds. An algorithm for downloading orbital information and tracking known satellites given observer constraints and time-ordered observatory pointing is described. Consequences for cosmological surveys and short-duration transient searches are discussed, revealing that the integrated thermal emission from all large satellites does not contribute significantly to the SPT-3G survey intensity map. Measured satellite positions are found to be discrepant from their two-line element (TLE) derived ephemerides up to several arcminutes which may present a difficulty in cross-checking or masking satellites from short-duration transient searches.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Amplification of Chiral Gravitational Waves and the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological vacuum amplification of gravitational waves in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We develop a comprehensive framework to compute graviton production induced by the parity violating Pontryagin coupling and study its imprint on the stochastic gravitational wave background energy power spectrum. We explore gravitational vacuum amplification in four concrete scenarios for the evolution of the Chern-Simons pseudoscalar. We show that a parity-violating contribution dominates over an initially flat spectrum when the velocity of the pseudoscalar quickly interpolates between two asymptotically constant values or when it is nonvanishing and constant through a finite period of time. This is also the case when we parametrize the pseudoscalar evolution by a perfect fluid with radiation- and dust-like equations of state for large enough values of its energy density. The resulting spectra are compared with the sensitivity curves of current and future gravitational wave observational searches.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields limit the mass of Population III stars even before the onset of protostellar radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\,\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\sim 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. We quantify the fractional contribution of each event to the constraints on the population hyperparameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>
