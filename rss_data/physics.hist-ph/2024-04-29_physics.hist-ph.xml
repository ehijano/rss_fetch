      <title>On the Meaning of Local Symmetries: Epistemic-Ontological Dialectic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose our account of the meaning of local symmetries. We argue that the general covariance principle and gauge principle both are principles of democratic epistemic access to the law of physics, leading to ontological insights about the objective nature of spacetime. We further argue that relationality is a core notion of general-relativistic gauge field theory, tacitly encoded by its (active) local symmetries.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariance through Gauge Fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phenomena in gauge theory are often described in the physics literature via a specific choice of gauge. In foundational and philosophical discussions this is often criticized as introducing gauge dependence, and contrasted against (often aspirational) "gauge-invariant" descriptions of the physics. I argue, largely in the context of scalar electrodynamics, that this is misguided, and that descriptions of a physical process within a specific gauge are in fact gauge-invariant descriptions. However, most of them are non-local descriptions of that physics, and I suggest that this ought to be the real objection to such descriptions. I explore the unitary gauge as the exception to this nonlocality and consider its strengths and limitations, as well as (more briefly) its extension beyond scalar electrodynamics.</description>
