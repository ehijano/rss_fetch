      <title>Fast and Exact Least Absolute Deviations Line Fitting via Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Least-absolute-deviations (LAD) line fitting is robust to outliers but computationally more involved than least squares regression. Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers. We provide a reference implementation written in Rust with a Python API.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models in Simulation-Based Inference: A Tutorial Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful learners for simulation-based inference (SBI), enabling fast and accurate estimation of latent parameters from simulated and real data. Their score-based formulation offers a flexible way to learn conditional or joint distributions over parameters and observations, thereby providing a versatile solution to various modeling problems. In this tutorial review, we synthesize recent developments on diffusion models for SBI, covering design choices for training, inference, and evaluation. We highlight opportunities created by various concepts such as guidance, score composition, flow matching, consistency models, and joint modeling. Furthermore, we discuss how efficiency and statistical accuracy are affected by noise schedules, parameterizations, and samplers. Finally, we illustrate these concepts with case studies across parameter dimensionalities, simulation budgets, and model types, and outline open questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Weighted MCC: A Robust Measure of Multiclass Classifier Performance for Observations with Individual Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several performance measures are used to evaluate binary and multiclass classification tasks.
  But individual observations may often have distinct weights, and none of these measures are sensitive to such varying weights.
  We propose a new weighted Pearson-Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) for binary classification as well as weighted versions of related multiclass measures. The weighted MCC varies between $-1$ and $1$. But crucially, the weighted MCC values are higher for classifiers that perform better on highly weighted observations, and hence is able to distinguish them from classifiers that have a similar overall performance and ones that perform better on the lowly weighted observations.
  Furthermore, we prove that the weighted measures are robust with respect to the choice of weights in a precise manner:
  if the weights are changed by at most $\epsilon$, the value of the weighted measure changes at most by a factor of $\epsilon$ in the binary case
  and by a factor of $\epsilon^2$ in the multiclass case.
  Our computations demonstrate that the weighted measures clearly identify classifiers that perform better on higher weighted observations, while the unweighted measures remain completely indifferent to the choices of weights.</description>

      <title>Learning from Neighbors with PHIBP: Predicting Infectious Disease Dynamics in Data-Sparse Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling sparse count data, which arise across numerous scientific fields, presents significant statistical challenges. This chapter addresses these challenges in the context of infectious disease prediction, with a focus on predicting outbreaks in geographic regions that have historically reported zero cases. To this end, we present the detailed computational framework and experimental application of the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), with demonstrated success in handling sparse count data in microbiome and ecological studies. The PHIBP's architecture, grounded in the concept of absolute abundance, systematically borrows statistical strength from related regions and circumvents the known sensitivities of relative-rate methods to zero counts. Through a series of experiments on infectious disease data, we show that this principled approach provides a robust foundation for generating coherent predictive distributions and for the effective use of comparative measures such as alpha and beta diversity. The chapter's emphasis on algorithmic implementation and experimental results confirms that this unified framework delivers both accurate outbreak predictions and meaningful epidemiological insights in data-sparse settings.</description>

      <title>Enhancing diffusion models with Gaussianization preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks such as image generation. However, one of the bottlenecks of these models is slow sampling due to the delay before the onset of trajectory bifurcation, at which point substantial reconstruction begins. This issue degrades generation quality, especially in the early stages. Our primary objective is to mitigate bifurcation-related issues by preprocessing the training data to enhance reconstruction quality, particularly for small-scale network architectures. Specifically, we propose applying Gaussianization preprocessing to the training data to make the target distribution more closely resemble an independent Gaussian distribution, which serves as the initial density of the reconstruction process. This preprocessing step simplifies the model's task of learning the target distribution, thereby improving generation quality even in the early stages of reconstruction with small networks. The proposed method is, in principle, applicable to a broad range of generative tasks, enabling more stable and efficient sampling processes.</description>

      <title>Causal-driven attribution (CDA): Estimating channel influence without user-level data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attribution modelling lies at the heart of marketing effectiveness, yet most existing approaches depend on user-level path data, which are increasingly inaccessible due to privacy regulations and platform restrictions. This paper introduces a Causal-Driven Attribution (CDA) framework that infers channel influence using only aggregated impression-level data, avoiding any reliance on user identifiers or click-path tracking. CDA integrates temporal causal discovery (using PCMCI) with causal effect estimation via a Structural Causal Model to recover directional channel relationships and quantify their contributions to conversions. Using large-scale synthetic data designed to replicate real marketing dynamics, we show that CDA achieves an average relative RMSE of 9.50% when given the true causal graph, and 24.23% when using the predicted graph, demonstrating strong accuracy under correct structure and meaningful signal recovery even under structural uncertainty. CDA captures cross-channel interdependencies while providing interpretable, privacy-preserving attribution insights, offering a scalable and future-proof alternative to traditional path-based models.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented Pollen Recognition in Optical and Holographic Microscopy for Veterinary Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.</description>

      <title>Random Gradient-Free Optimization in Infinite Dimensional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a random gradient-free method for optimization in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, applicable to functional optimization in diverse settings. Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations \`a la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence.</description>

      <title>Subgroup Discovery with the Cox Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of subgroup discovery for survival analysis, where the goal is to find an interpretable subset of the data on which a Cox model is highly accurate. Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.
  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a "quality function" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.
  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.</description>

      <title>Invariant Feature Extraction Through Conditional Independence and the Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem: the Gaussian case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A methodology is developed to extract $d$ invariant features $W=f(X)$ that predict a response variable $Y$ without being confounded by variables $Z$ that may influence both $X$ and $Y$.
  The methodology's main ingredient is the penalization of any statistical dependence between $W$ and $Z$ conditioned on $Y$, replaced by the more readily implementable plain independence between $W$ and the random variable $Z_Y = T(Z,Y)$ that solves the [Monge] Optimal Transport Barycenter Problem for $Z\mid Y$. In the Gaussian case considered in this article, the two statements are equivalent.
  When the true confounders $Z$ are unknown, other measurable contextual variables $S$ can be used as surrogates, a replacement that involves no relaxation in the Gaussian case if the covariance matrix $\Sigma_{ZS}$ has full range. The resulting linear feature extractor adopts a closed form in terms of the first $d$ eigenvectors of a known matrix. The procedure extends with little change to more general, non-Gaussian / non-linear cases.</description>

      <title>Understanding Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks via Feature Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to scaling laws that predict consistent gains as model, data, and compute grow; however, large models can exhibit training instability and diminishing returns, suggesting that scaling laws describe what success looks like but not when and why scaling succeeds or fails. A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.</description>

      <title>Statistical and computational challenges in ranking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of ranking $n$ experts according to their abilities, based on the correctness of their answers to $d$ questions. This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $\pi^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{\pi^{*-1}(i),k} \geq M_{\pi^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\in [n-1], k \in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $\pi^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $\lambda \mathbf 1\{S\times T\}$ where $S\subset [n], T\subset [d]$. This model has been extensively studied. We provide an overview of the results and proof techniques for this problem with a particular emphasis on the computational lower bounds based on low-degree polynomial methods. Then, we build upon this instrumental sub-problem to discuss existing results and algorithmic ideas for the general ranking problem.</description>

      <title>Active inference and artificial reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.</description>

      <title>Does the Data Processing Inequality Reflect Practice? On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform "low-level" tasks before "high-level" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs. Second, paired prediction noise typically exceeds paired data noise, which means reducing prediction noise by averaging can significantly increase statistical power. These findings enable practitioners to assess significance without custom testing and to detect much smaller effects in controlled experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Deep Kronecker Network (DKN), a novel framework designed for analyzing medical imaging data, such as MRI, fMRI, CT, etc. Medical imaging data is different from general images in at least two aspects: i) sample size is usually much more limited, ii) model interpretation is more of a concern compared to outcome prediction. Due to its unique nature, general methods, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), are difficult to be directly applied. As such, we propose DKN, that is able to i) adapt to low sample size limitation, ii) provide desired model interpretation, and iii) achieve the prediction power as CNN. The DKN is general in the sense that it not only works for both matrix and (high-order) tensor represented image data, but also could be applied to both discrete and continuous outcomes. The DKN is built on a Kronecker product structure and implicitly imposes a piecewise smooth property on coefficients. Moreover, the Kronecker structure can be written into a convolutional form, so DKN also resembles a CNN, particularly, a fully convolutional network (FCN). Furthermore, we prove that with an alternating minimization algorithm, the solutions of DKN are guaranteed to converge to the truth geometrically even if the objective function is highly nonconvex. Interestingly, the DKN is also highly connected to the tensor regression framework proposed by Zhou et al. (2010), where a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) low-rank structure is imposed on tensor coefficients. Finally, we conduct both classification and regression analyses using real MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to demonstrate the effectiveness of DKN.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a framework for robo-advisors to estimate non-expert clients' risk aversion using adaptive binary-choice questionnaires. We model risk aversion using cost functions and spectral risk measures in a static setting. We prove the finite-sample identifiability and, for properly designed questions, obtain a convergence rate of $\sqrt{N}$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of questions. We introduce the notion of distinguishing power and demonstrate, through simulated experiments, that designing questions by maximizing distinguishing power achieves satisfactory accuracy in learning risk aversion with fewer than 50 questions. We also provide a preliminary investigation of an infinite-horizon setting with an additional discount factor for dynamic risk aversion, establishing qualitative identifiability in this case.</description>

      <title>Neural Dynamic Data Valuation: A Stochastic Optimal Control Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19557v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data valuation has become a cornerstone of the modern data economy, where datasets function as tradable intellectual assets that drive decision-making, model training, and market transactions. Despite substantial progress, existing valuation methods remain limited by high computational cost, weak fairness guarantees, and poor interpretability, which hinder their deployment in large-scale, high-stakes applications. This paper introduces Neural Dynamic Data Valuation (NDDV), a new framework that formulates data valuation as a stochastic optimal control problem to capture the dynamic evolution of data utility over time. Unlike static combinatorial approaches, NDDV models data interactions through continuous trajectories that reflect both individual and collective learning dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06096v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental but largely unexplored challenge in sequential changepoint analysis: conducting inference following a detected change. We develop a very general framework to construct confidence sets for the unknown changepoint using only the data observed up to a data-dependent stopping time at which an arbitrary sequential detection algorithm declares a change. Our framework is nonparametric, making no assumption on the composite post-change class, the observation space, or the sequential detection procedure used, and is non-asymptotically valid. We also extend it to handle composite pre-change classes under a suitable assumption, and also derive confidence sets for the change magnitude in parametric settings. We provide theoretical guarantees on the width of our confidence intervals. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the produced sets have reasonable size, and slightly conservative coverage. In summary, we present the first general method for sequential changepoint localization, which is theoretically sound and broadly applicable in practice.</description>

      <title>Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17836v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. Here this shortcoming is addressed by using machine learning to map the joint predicted state and observation to the updated state estimate. The derivation of methods from a mean field formulation of the true filtering distribution suggests a single parametrization of the algorithm that can be deployed at different ensemble sizes. And we use a mean field formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter as an inductive bias for our architecture.
  To develop this perspective, in which the mean-field limit of the algorithm and finite interacting ensemble particle approximations share a common set of parameters, a novel form of neural operator is introduced, taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz '96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>

      <title>Optimal Model Selection for Conformalized Robust Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decision-making under uncertainty, Contextual Robust Optimization (CRO) provides reliability by minimizing the worst-case decision loss over a prediction set. While recent advances use conformal prediction to construct prediction sets for machine learning models, the downstream decisions critically depend on model selection. This paper introduces novel model selection frameworks for CRO that unify robustness control with decision risk minimization. We first propose Conformalized Robust Optimization with Model Selection (CROMS), a framework that selects the model to approximately minimize the averaged decision risk in CRO solutions. Given the target robustness level 1-\alpha, we present a computationally efficient algorithm called E-CROMS, which achieves asymptotic robustness control and decision optimality. To correct the control bias in finite samples, we further develop two algorithms: F-CROMS, which ensures a 1-\alpha robustness but requires searching the label space; and J-CROMS, which offers lower computational cost while achieving a 1-2\alpha robustness. Furthermore, we extend the CROMS framework to the individualized setting, where model selection is performed by minimizing the conditional decision risk given the covariates of the test data. This framework advances conformal prediction methodology by enabling covariate-aware model selection. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in decision efficiency across diverse synthetic and real-world applications, outperforming baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Explicit Group Sparse Projection with Applications to Deep Learning and NMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.03896v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design a new sparse projection method for a set of vectors that guarantees a desired average sparsity level measured leveraging the popular Hoyer measure (an affine function of the ratio of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms). Existing approaches either project each vector individually or require the use of a regularization parameter which implicitly maps to the average $\ell_0$-measure of sparsity. Instead, in our approach we set the sparsity level for the whole set explicitly and simultaneously project a group of vectors with the sparsity level of each vector tuned automatically. We show that the computational complexity of our projection operator is linear in the size of the problem. Additionally, we propose a generalization of this projection by replacing the $\ell_1$ norm by its weighted version. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks on image datasets including CIFAR10 and ImageNet. In deep neural network pruning, the sparse models produced by our method on ResNet50 have significantly higher accuracies at corresponding sparsity values compared to existing competitors. In nonnegative matrix factorization, our approach yields competitive reconstruction errors against state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with constraints against stochastic thresholds, aiming at safety of reinforcement learning in unknown and uncertain environments. We leverage a Growing-Window estimator sampling from interactions with the uncertain environment to estimate the thresholds, based on which we design Stochastic Pessimistic-Optimistic Thresholding (SPOT), a novel model-based primal-dual algorithm for multiple constraints against stochastic thresholds. SPOT enables reinforcement learning under both pessimistic and optimistic threshold settings. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret and constraint violation; i.e., a reward regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ while allowing an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation over $T$ episodes. The theoretical guarantees show that our algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of an approach relying on fixed and clear thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, SPOT is the first reinforcement learning algorithm that realises theoretical guaranteed performance in an uncertain environment where even thresholds are unknown.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Inference Time Scaling for Solving High-Dimensional PDE via Defect Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is a critical challenge where modern data-driven solvers often lack reliability and rigorous error guarantees. We introduce Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML), a framework that systematically improves pre-trained PDE solvers at inference time without any retraining. Our core idea is to use defect correction method that derive a new PDE, termed Structural-preserving Law of Defect, that precisely describes the error of a given surrogate model. Since it retains the structure of the original problem, we can solve it efficiently with traditional stochastic simulators and correct the initial machine-learned solution. We prove that SCaSML achieves a faster convergence rate, with a final error bounded by the product of the surrogate and simulation errors. On challenging PDEs up to 160 dimensions, SCaSML reduces the error of various surrogate models, including PINNs and Gaussian Processes, by 20-80%. Code of SCaSML is available at https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.</description>

      <title>Improving Coverage in Combined Prediction Sets with Weighted p-values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by augmenting point predictions with valid prediction sets. For complex scenarios involving multiple trials, models, or data sources, conformal prediction sets can be aggregated to create a prediction set that captures the overall uncertainty, often improving precision. However, aggregating multiple prediction sets with individual $1-\alpha$ coverage inevitably weakens the overall guarantee, typically resulting in $1-2\alpha$ worst-case coverage. In this work, we propose a framework for the weighted aggregation of prediction sets, where weights are assigned to each prediction set based on their contribution. Our framework offers flexible control over how the sets are aggregated, achieving tighter coverage bounds that interpolate between the $1-2\alpha$ guarantee of the combined models and the $1-\alpha$ guarantee of an individual model depending on the distribution of weights. Importantly, our framework generalizes to data-dependent weights, as we derive a procedure for weighted aggregation that maintains finite-sample validity even when the weights depend on the data. This extension makes our framework broadly applicable to settings where weights are learned, such as mixture-of-experts (MoE), and we demonstrate through experiments in the MoE setting that our methods achieve adaptive coverage.</description>

      <title>Alternating Gradient Flows: A Theory of Feature Learning in Two-layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06489v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What features neural networks learn, and how, remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic framework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks trained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in this regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus where neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons rapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step process: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a cost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each iteration, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and a drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these drops, matching experiments across several commonly studied architectures. We show that AGF unifies and extends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks and attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular modes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we prove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization. Applying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give the first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that networks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude. Altogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning in neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy - Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) - against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement (EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization encompasses flexible variants - including random or adaptive schemes - our results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization, especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Sequential Adaptive Priors for Orthogonal Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of prior distributions for sequences of orthogonal functions, which are frequently required in various statistical models such as functional principal component analysis (FPCA). Our approach constructs priors sequentially by imposing adaptive orthogonality constraints through a hierarchical formulation of conditionally normal distributions. The orthogonality is controlled via hyperparameters, allowing for flexible trade-offs between exactness and smoothness, which can be learned from the observed data. We illustrate the properties of the proposed prior and show that it leads to nearly orthogonal posterior estimates. The proposed prior is employed in Bayesian FPCA, providing more interpretable principal functions and efficient low-rank representations. Through simulation studies and analysis of human mobility data in Tokyo, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in inducing orthogonality and improving functional component estimation.</description>

      <title>Don't Pass@k: A Bayesian Framework for Large Language Model Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials (samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over $N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical (not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$), explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty. Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants, enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded, rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$ for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty explicit.
