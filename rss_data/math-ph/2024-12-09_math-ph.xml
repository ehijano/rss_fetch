      <title>Intertwining vectors, and Boltzmann weight matrices, of a Solid-on-Solid model from the 20-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a new study on the correspondence between the 20-vertex model and a SOS (Solid-on-Solid) model. In comparison to two previous works of the author in 2024 which characterized properties of the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices of the 20-vertex model from the perspective of the quantum inverse scattering method, in addition to the structure of nonlocal correlations, the forthcoming approach is an adaptation of a study on the rational 7-vertex model. For the rational 7-vertex model, Antoenneko and Valinevich demonstrated that the intertwining vectors can be used to transform the R-matrix of a vertex model into the Boltzman weight matrix of an SOS model. To further develop perspectives on classes of higher dimensional SOS models, by leveraging previous computations with L-operators due to the author, and by also manipulating q-exponentials, and other related factors from a factorization of the universal R-matrix due to Boos et al, analogs of intertwining vectors for the 20- vertex model can be obtained. In comparison to the system of equations that have been obtained for the rational 7-vertex model, the system that one obtains for the 20-vertex model consists of 9 equations for each entry of the R-matrix. Furthermore, from the fact that the 20-vertex model contains more possible configurations in the sample space than the rational 7-vertex model does, the Boltzman weight matrix of the corresponding SOS model asymptotically depends upon several contributions, a few of which include tensor products of basis elements, and spectral parameters over the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Enlargement of symmetry groups in physics: a practitioner's guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner's classification has led to the insight that projective unitary representations play a prominent role in quantum mechanics. The physics literature often states that the theory of projective unitary representations can be reduced to the theory of ordinary unitary representations by enlarging the group of physical symmetries. Nevertheless, the enlargement process is not always described explicitly: it is unclear in which cases the enlargement has to be done to the universal cover, a central extension, or to a central extension of the universal cover. On the other hand, in the mathematical literature, projective unitary representations were extensively studied, and famous theorems such as the theorems of Bargmann and Cassinelli have been achieved. The present article bridges the two: we provide a precise, step-by-step guide on describing projective unitary representations as unitary representations of the enlarged group. Particular focus is paid to the difference between algebraic and topological obstructions. To build the bridge mentioned above, we present a detailed review of the difference between group cohomology and Lie group cohomology. This culminates in classifying Lie group central extensions by smooth cocycles around the identity. Finally, the take-away message is a hands-on algorithm that takes the symmetry group of a given quantum theory as input and provides the enlarged group as output. This algorithm is applied to several cases of physical interest. We also briefly outline a generalization of Bargmann's theory to time-dependent phases using Hilbert bundles.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory for periodic vector NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a first order operator with a periodic 3x3 matrix potential on the real line. This operator appears in the problem of the periodic vector NLS equation. The spectrum of the operator covers the real line, it is union of the spectral bands of multiplicity 3, separated by spectral intervals of multiplicity 1. The main results of this work are the following: 
The Lyapunov function on the corresponding 2 or 3-sheeted Riemann surface is described. 
Necessary and sufficient conditions are given when the Riemann surface is 2-sheeted. 
The asymptotics of 2-periodic eigenvalues are determined. 
One constructs an entire function, which is positive on the spectrum of multiplicity 3 and is negative on its gaps. 
The Borg type results about inverse problems are solved.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum walkers coupled to a bosonic reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the discrete-time dynamics of a model of non-interacting fermions on a finite graph coupled to an infinite reservoir formed by a bosonic quantum walk on Z. This dynamics consists of consecutive applications of free evolutions of the fermions and bosons followed by a local coupling between them. The unitary operator implementing this coupling generates fermionic transitions between two fixed vertices induced by absorption and emission of bosons at a single lattice site. The free fermion evolution is given by a second-quantized single-particle unitary operator satisfying some genericity assumptions, in particular it produces hopping of fermions between all vertices. The free boson evolution is given by the second-quantized shift operator on Z. We derive explicitly the Heisenberg dynamics of fermionic observables and obtain a systematic expansion in the large-coupling regime, which we control by using spectral methods. We also prove that the reduced state of the fermions converges in the large-time limit to an infinite-temperature Gibbs</description>

      <title>Factorisability of the Harer-Zagier Transform of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Harer-Zagier (HZ) transform maps the HOMFLY-PT polynomial into a rational function. For some special knots and links, the latter has a simple factorised form, both in the numerator and denominator. This property seems to be preserved under full twists and concatenation with the Jucys--Murphy's braid, which are hence used to generate infinite families with HZ factorisability. For such families, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial can be fully encoded in two sets of integers, corresponding to the numerator and denominator exponents. These exponents turn out to be related to the Khovanov homology and its Euler characteristics. A criterion for when factorisability occurs is found via a conjectural relation between the HOMFLY-PT and Kauffman polynomials, which is proven in several special cases. The latter is equivalent to the vanishing of the two-crosscap BPS invariant of topological strings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Cheeger-Simons triangulation $(K, K')$ of a compact smooth oriented Riemannian manifold $M$ gives rise to a Cheeger-Simons model, which defines a finite dimensional differential character group $\mbox{Diff}^{\bullet}(\mathscr{CS}(K, K'))$. This group converges to the ordinary Cheeger-Simons differential character group $\widehat{H}^{\bullet}(M)$. We introduce a simplicial higher abelian gauge theory based on Cheeger-Simons models and demonstrate that, as the mesh approaches zero, the partition function of this theory converges to the one proposed by Kelnhofer in \cite{K2}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric linearization of nonlinear differential equation is a robust method for the construction of analytic solutions. The method is related to the existence of Lie symmetries which can be used to determine point transformations such that to write the given differential equation in a linear form. In this study we employ another geometric approach and we utilize the Eisenhart lift to geometric linearize the Newtonian system describing the motion of a particle in a line under the application of an autonomous force. Our findings reveal that for the oscillator, the Ermakov potential with or without the oscillator term, and the Morse potential, Newton's second law can be globally expressed in the form of that of a free particle. This study open new directions for the geometric linearization of differential equations via equivalent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the Brascamp-Lieb Inequality and the Dipole Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with lattice field models in dimension at least 2. The action is a uniformly convex function of the gradient of the field. The main result Theorem 1.4 proves that charge-charge correlations in the Coulomb dipole gas are close to Gaussian. These results go beyond previous results of Dimock-Hurd and Conlon-Spencer. The approach in the paper is based on the observation that the sine-Gordon probability measure corresponding to the dipole gas is the invariant measure for a certain stochastic dynamics. The stochastic dynamics here differs from the stochastic dynamics in previous work used to study the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Frobenius manifold structure on the space of rational functions with multiple simple poles is constructed. In particular, the dependence of the Saito-flat coordinates on the flat coordinates of the intersection form is studied. While some of the individual flat coordinates are complicated rational functions, they appear in the prepotential in certain combinations known as diagonal invariants, which turn out to be polynomial. Two classes are studied in more detail. These are generalisations of the Coxeter and extended-affine-Weyl orbits space for the group $W=W(A_\ell)\,.$ An invariant theory is also developed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of the sum of large random matrices that are mutually "free", i.e. randomly rotated, can be obtained using the formalism of R-transforms, with many applications in different fields. We provide a direct interpretation of the otherwise abstract additivity property of R-transforms for the sum in terms of a deterministic dynamical evolution of "particles" (the eigenvalues), interacting through two-body and higher-body forces, generalizing the usual Coulomb interaction. We extend our result to product of free matrices.</description>

      <title>Clustering-induced localization of quantum walks on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks on networks are a paradigmatic model in quantum information theory. Quantum-walk algorithms have been developed for various applications, including spatial-search problems, element-distinctness problems, and node centrality analysis. Unlike their classical counterparts, the evolution of quantum walks is unitary, so they do not converge to a stationary distribution. However, it is important for many applications to understand the long-time behavior of quantum walks and the impact of network structure on their evolution. In the present paper, we study the localization of quantum walks on networks. We demonstrate how localization emerges in highly clustered networks that we construct by recursively attaching triangles, and we derive an analytical expression for the long-time inverse participation ratio that depends on products of eigenvectors of the quantum-walk Hamiltonian. Building on the insights from this example, we then show that localization also occurs in Kleinberg navigable small-world networks and Holme--Kim power-law cluster networks. Our results illustrate that local clustering, which is a key structural feature of networks, can induce localization of quantum walks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two results concerning percolation on general graphs.
  - We establish the converse of the classical Peierls argument: if the critical parameter for (uniform) percolation satisfies $p_c&lt;1$, then the number of minimal cutsets of size $n$ separating a given vertex from infinity is bounded above exponentially in $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Babson and Benjamini from 1999.
  - We prove that $p_c&lt;1$ for every uniformly transient graph. This solves a problem raised by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Raoufi, Severo and Yadin, and provides a new proof that $p_c&lt;1$ for every transitive graph of superlinear growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two families of random tridiagonal block matrices for which the joint eigenvalue distributions can be computed explicitly. These distributions are novel within random matrix theory, and exhibit interactions among eigenvalue coordinates beyond the typical mean-field log-gas type. Leveraging the matrix models, we go on to describe the point process limits at the edges of the spectrum in two ways: through certain random differential operators, and also in terms of coupled systems of diffusions. Along the way we establish several algebraic identities involving sums of Vandermonde determinant products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How should we model an observer within quantum mechanics or quantum field theory? How can classical physics emerge from a quantum model, and why should classical probability be useful? How can we model a selective measurement entirely within a closed quantum system? This paper sketches a new physical theory of probability based on an attempt to model classical information within a purely quantum system. We model classical information using a version of Zurek's theory of Quantum Darwinism, with emphasis on quantum information encoded using projection operators localised in spacetime. This version of Quantum Darwinism is compatible with quantum field theory, and does not require any artificial division of a quantum system into subsystems. The main innovation is our attempt to provide a physical explanation of probability. Decoherence is the physical mechanism behind Quantum Darwinism or the `branching of quantum worlds'. Assuming a type of perfect decoherence we construct a conventional probabilistic model for classical information. This, however, is not our theory of natural probability, and does not quite demonstrate the validity of Bayesian reasoning. Instead, our theory of natural probability arises from careful consideration of errors in decoherence: roughly speaking, we don't observe low probability events because they are swamped by quantum noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian tracer particle trajectories for invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations confined to the three-dimensional geometry of plane Couette flow are studied. Treating the Eulerian velocity field of an invariant solution as a dynamical system, the transport of these passive scalars along Lagrangian flow trajectories reveals a rich repertoire of different types of motion that can occur, including stagnation points, for which there is no fluid movement, and invariant tori, which obstruct chaotic mixing across the full volume of the plane Couette flow minimal cell. We determine the stability of these stagnation points, along with their stable and unstable manifolds, and find heteroclinic connections between them. These topological features produce a skeleton that shapes the passive tracer flow for a turbulent fluid, providing a first step to elucidating Lagrangian particle transport and mixing in three-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Non-rotational measures in the Bargmann space, and entanglement of bipartite squeezed coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement of bipartite squeezed states generated by holomorphic Hermite functions of two complex variables is investigated using phase-space approach based on the Wigner distribution function. Orthogonality of the holomorphic Hermite functions implies the relationship between certain real parameter associated with the non-rotational measure in the Bargmann space and the squeezing parameter. The mutual relation between squeezing and entanglement is elucidated with the help of Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion formulated in the phase-space version for continuous-variable systems. The quantitative characteristics of the entanglement is determined using the log-negativity criterion. The oscillator-like model of a two-particle quantum-mechanical system is developed to illustrate the presented findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal geodesics form an invariantly defined family of unparametrized curves in a conformal manifold generalizing unparametrized geodesics/paths of projective connections. The equation describing them is of third order, and it was an open problem whether they are given by an Euler--Lagrange equation. In dimension 3 (the simplest, but most important from the viewpoint of physical applications) we demonstrate that the equation for unparametrized conformal geodesics is variational.</description>

      <title>Center of affine $\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}$ at the critical level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we shall describe the center of the universal affine vertex superalgebra $V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak g)$ associated with $\mathfrak g=\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}, \mathfrak {gl}_{2|1}$ at the critical level $\kappa_c$ and prove the conjecture of A. Molev and E. Ragoucy in this case.
  The center $\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ turns out to be isomorphic to the large level limit $\ell \rightarrow \infty$ of a vertex subalgebra, called the parafermion vertex algebra $K^{\ell} (\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, of the affine vertex algebra $V^\ell(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. The key ingredient of the proof is to understand the principal $W$-superalgebra $ W^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1})$ at the critical level. It relates the center $\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl} _{2|1}))$ to $V^\infty(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ via the Kazama-Suzuki duality while it has a surprising coincidence with $V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1})$, whose center has been recently described. Moreover, the centers $\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ and $\mathfrak{z}(W^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{2|1}))$ are proven to coincide as a byproduct.
  A general conjecture is proposed which describes the center $\mathfrak{z}(V^{\kappa_c}(\mathfrak{sl}_{n|m}))$ with $n&gt;m$ as a large level limit of ``the dual side'', i.e., the parafermion-type subalgebras of $W$-algebras $ W^\ell(\mathfrak{sl}_{n}, \mathbb{O}_{[n-m,1^m]})$ associated with hook-type partitions $[n-m,1^m]$, known also as vertex algebras at the corner.</description>

Abstract: In this note we give a criterion for the existence of a fractional-linear integral for a geodesic flow on a Riemannian surface and explain that modulo M\"obius transformations the moduli space of such local integrals (if nonempty) is either the two-dimensional projective plane or a finite number of points. We will also consider explicit examples and discuss a relation of such rational integrals to Killing vectors.</description>

      <title>Affine relationships between steady currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbing transition rates in a steady nonequilibrium system, e.g. modeled by a Markov jump process, causes a change in the local currents. Their susceptibility is usually expressed via Green-Kubo relations or their nonequilibrium extensions. However, we may also wish to directly express the mutual relation between currents. Such a nonperturbative interrelation was discovered by P.E. Harunari et al. in [1] by applying algebraic graph theory showing the mutual linearity of currents over different edges in a graph. We give a novel and shorter derivation of that current relationship where we express the current-current susceptibility as a difference in mean first-passage times. It allows an extension to multiple currents, which remains affine but the relation is not additive.</description>

      <title>Exact Model Reduction for Continuous-Time Open Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</description>

      <title>Defects and Phases of Higher Rank Abelian GLSMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct defects describing the transition between different phases of gauged linear sigma models with higher rank abelian gauge groups, as well as defects embedding these phases into the GLSMs. Our construction refers entirely to the sector protected by B-type supersymmetry, decoupling the gauge sector. It relies on an abstract characterization of such transition defects and does not involve an actual perturbative analysis. It turns out that the choices that are required to characterize consistent transition defects match with the homotopy classes of paths between different phases. Our method applies to non-anomalous as well as anomalous GLSMs, and we illustrate both cases with examples. This includes the GLSM associated to the resolution of the $A_N$ singularity and one describing the entire parameter space of $N = 2$ minimal models, in particular, the relevant flows between them. Via fusion with boundary conditions, the defects we construct yield functors describing the transport of D-branes on parameter space. We find that our results match with known results on D-brane transport.</description>

      <title>Fast Laplace transforms on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many classical algorithms rely on Laplace transforms, it has remained an open question whether these operations could be implemented efficiently on quantum computers. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT), which enables the implementation of $N\times N$ discrete Laplace transforms on quantum states encoded in $\lceil \log_2(N)\rceil$-qubits. In many cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$ as $O(\log(\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\log(N))$, requiring exponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time than their classical counterparts. These efficient scalings open the possibility of developing a new class of quantum algorithms based on Laplace transforms, with potential applications in physics, engineering, chemistry, machine learning, and finance.</description>

      <title>Go-or-Grow Models in Biology: a Monster on a Leash</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Go-or-grow approaches represent a specific class of mathematical models used to describe populations where individuals either migrate or reproduce, but not both simultaneously. These models have a wide range of applications in biology and medicine, chiefly among those the modeling of brain cancer spread. The analysis of go-or-grow models has inspired new mathematics, and it is the purpose of this review to highlight interesting and challenging mathematical properties of reaction--diffusion models of the go-or-grow type. We provide a detailed review of biological and medical applications before focusing on key results concerning solution existence and uniqueness, pattern formation, critical domain size problems, and traveling waves. We present new general results related to the critical domain size and traveling wave problems, and we connect these findings to the existing literature. Moreover, we demonstrate the high level of instability inherent in go-or-grow models. We argue that there is currently no accurate numerical solver for these models, and emphasize that special care must be taken when dealing with the "monster on a leash".</description>

Abstract: We study a hierarchical model of non-overlapping cubes of sidelengths $2^j$, $j \in \mathbb{Z}$. The model allows for cubes of arbitrarily small size and the activities need not be translationally invariant. It can also be recast as a spin system on a tree with long-range hard-core interaction. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Gibbs measures, discuss fragmentation and condensation, and prove bounds on the decay of two-point correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06587v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit two papers which appeared in 1999: [1] M. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, and N. Nadirashvili. On the multiplicity of eigenvalues of the Laplacian on surfaces. Ann. Global Anal. Geom. 17 (1999) 43--48. [2] T. Hoffmann-Ostenhof, P. Michor, and N. Nadirashvili. Bounds on the multiplicity of eigenvalues for fixed membranes. Geom. Funct. Anal. 9 (1999) 1169--1188. The main result of these papers is that the multiplicity $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k(M))$ of the $k$th eigenvalue of the Riemannian surface $M$ is bounded from above by $(2k-3)$ provided that $k \ge 3$. In [1], $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. In [2], $M$ is a plane domain with Dirichlet boundary condition. In both cases, the starting label of eigenvalues is $1$. The proofs given in [1,2] are not very detailed, and often rely on figures or special configurations of nodal sets. The purpose of this monograph is to provide detailed general proofs for the above upper bounds and to extend the results to Robin boundary conditions. When $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, we provide a complete proof that $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for any $k\ge 3$, by introducing and carefully studying the combinatorial type and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. When $M$ is a plane domain, we consider Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions and we also study the combinatorial types and a labeling of the nodal domains of some particular eigenfunctions. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-2)$ for general $C^{\infty}$ bounded domains and all $k \ge 3$. We prove the inequality $\mathrm{mult}(\lambda_k) \le (2k-3)$ for $k \ge 3$ under the additional assumption that the domain is simply connected.</description>

      <title>On the Exact Maxwell evolution equation of resonator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent publication [Opt. Express 32, 20904 (2024)], the accuracy of the main evolution equation that governs resonator dynamics in the coupled-mode theory (CMT) was questioned. The study concluded that the driving force is proportional to the temporal derivative of the excitation field rather than the excitation field itself. This conclusion was reached with a derivation of an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation obtained directly from Maxwell's equations, which was further supported by extensive numerical tests. Hereafter, we argue that the original derivation lacks mathematical rigor. We present a direct and rigorous derivation that establishes a solid mathematical foundation for the EME equation. This new approach clarifies the origin of the temporal derivative in the excitation term of CMT and elucidates the approximations present in the classical CMT evolution equation through a straightforward argument.</description>

      <title>Radial Mode Stability of Two-Fluid Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radial mode stability is a necessary condition for the astrophysical viability of compact objects. In recent years, astrophysical models with two fluids have gain popularity, especially in their ability to model dark matter admixed neutron stars. Just as is the case of single-fluid stars, a stability criterion based on the background equations has been developed -- the critical curve for the particle numbers of the two fluids in the two-dimensional configuration space determines a one-dimensional sequence that labels the marginally stable configurations -- but its validity depends on the linear stability of radial perturbations which remains unstudied. In this paper, we establish a set of stability criteria for two perfect-fluid relativistic stars by carefully studying the radial mode perturbation equations. We prove that modes are complete, have real eigenvalues with a minimum eigenvalue (i.e. a fundamental mode), thus a configuration is stable if and only if the fundamental mode is positive. As a consequence, our work formally and rigorously proves these necessary conditions for the stability criterion based on the background equations.</description>

      <title>Integrals of motion in conformal field theory with W-symmetry and the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ODE/IM correspondence between two-dimensional $WA_{r}$/$WD_{r}$-type conformal field theories and the higher-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) obtained from the affine Toda field theories associated with $A_r^{(1)}/D_r^{(1)}$-type affine Lie algebras. We calculate the period integrals of the WKB solution to the ODE along the Pochhammer contour, where the WKB expansions correspond to the classical conserved currents of the Drinfeld-Sokolov integrable hierarchies. We also compute the integrals of motion for $WA_{r}$($WD_{r}$) algebras on a cylinder. Their eigenvalues on the vacuum state are confirmed to agree with the period integrals up to the sixth order. These results generalize the ODE/IM correspondence to higher-order ODEs and can be used to predict higher-order integrals of motion.</description>

      <title>The universe is not a Lie, but actually an Hopf, algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper I would like to show how the Deformed Special Relativity family of models - developed to approach spacetime quantization - can actually be applied to the description of classical cosmology. I use the bicrossproduct basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebra to describe photon propagation in deSitter classical General Relativity. I show the Hopf algebraic aspects of deSitter model, and give an explicit physical interpretation of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} Hopf algebraic features in spacetime. Such an approach allows to unravel some not yet known General Relativistic relations of deSitter cosmology, and reinterpret many features of Quantum Gravity phenomenology as classical properties of maximally symmetric spacetime models. In the last section of the paper I give a first example on how to apply this mathematical framework to more realistic (non maximally symmetric) spacetime models, such as $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ and matter-dominated universe.</description>

      <title>Off-shell color-kinematics duality from codifferentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the color-kinematics duality within the BV formalism, highlighting its emergence as a feature of specific gauge-fixed actions. Our goal is to establish a general framework for studying the duality while investigating straightforward examples of off-shell color-kinematics duality. In this context, we revisit Chern-Simons theory as well as introduce new examples, including BF theory and 2D Yang-Mills theory, which are shown to exhibit the duality off-shell. We emphasize that the geometric structures responsible for flat-space color-kinematics duality appear for general curved spaces as well.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping string models with entanglement minimization and Machine-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to bootstrapping string-like theories by exploiting a local crossing symmetric dispersion relation and field redefinition ambiguities. This approach enables us to use mass-level truncation and to go beyond the dual resonance hypothesis. We consider both open and closed strings, focusing mainly on open tree-level amplitudes with integer-spaced spectrum, and two leading Wilson coefficients as inputs. Using entanglement minimization in the form of the minimum of the first finite moment of linear entropy or entangling power, we get an excellent approximation to the superstring amplitudes, including the leading and sub-leading Regge trajectories. We find other interesting S-matrices which do not obey the duality hypothesis, but exhibit a transition from Regge behaviour to power law behaviour in the high energy limit. Finally, we also examine Machine-Learning techniques to do bootstrap and discuss potential advantages over the present approach.</description>

      <title>Curvature of an exotic 7-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the Gromoll-Meyer sphere, one of Milnor's exotic $7$-spheres. We focus on a Kaluza-Klein Ansatz, with a round $S^4$ as base space, unit $S^3$ as fibre, and $k=1,2$ $SU(2)$ instantons as gauge fields, where all quantities admit an elegant description in quaternionic language. The metric's moduli space coincides with the $k=1,2$ instantons' moduli space quotiented by the isometry of the base, plus an additional $\mathbb{R}^+$ factor corresponding to the radius of the base, $r$. We identify a "center" of the $k=2$ instanton moduli space with enhanced symmetry. This $k=2$ solution is used together with the maximally symmetric $k=1$ solution to obtain a metric of maximal isometry, $SO(3)\times O(2)$, and to explicitly compute its Ricci tensor. This allows us to put a bound on $r$ to ensure positive Ricci curvature, which implies various energy conditions for an $8$-dimensional static space-time. This construction then enables a concrete examination of the properties of the sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Ground state solutions for Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of ground state solutions by considering the minimization problem on a Nehari-Pohozaev set. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in the proof of the uniqueness of a maximum point of a fibering map. A key ingredient is to establish the energy inequality. We also establish the relation between ground state solutions and $L^2$-constraint minimizers. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature,are responsible for the existence of ground state solutions.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fixing Quantum Density Operators At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.</description>

      <title>Validity of the Fr\"ohlich model for a mobile impurity in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the many-body Hamiltonian describing a mobile impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using exact unitary transformations and rigorous error estimates, we show the validity of the Bogoliubov-Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian for the Bose polaron in the regime of moderately strong, repulsive interactions with a dilute BEC. Moreover, we calculate analytically the universal logarithmic correction to the ground state energy that arises from an impurity mediated phonon-phonon interaction.</description>
