      <title>Minimal Hamiltonian deformations as bulk probes of effective non-Hermiticity in Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac semimetals describe open gain--loss systems, yet at charge neutrality models featuring real spectrum often look Hermitian-like, with NH effects absorbed into renormalized band parameters. Here we show that a response-based diagnostic of effective non-Hermiticity can be formulated using minimal pseudo-Lorentz-symmetry-breaking deformations, which separate observables that remain captured by parameter redefinitions from those that exhibit irreducible NH structure. For a two-dimensional NH Dirac semimetal in the weak-NH, real-spectrum regime, we analyze Dirac-cone tilt and velocity anisotropy and compute representative probes of spectral structure, quantum geometry, optical response, and viscoelasticity at zero temperature. We find that tilt yields an NH-dependent slope of the density of states that cannot be collapsed to a single effective velocity, while velocity anisotropy can be captured by effective-velocity reparametrization. Furthermore, the quantum metric and collisionless optical conductivities provide NH-insensitive benchmarks (with the nonlinear conductivity symmetry selected), whereas the shear viscosity offers a discriminator through its tensor structure. Our results identify minimal deformations and bulk response channels that enable access to effective non-Hermiticity even when the spectrum remains real.</description>

      <title>Strong radial electric field scaling near nanoscale conductive filaments and the ReRAM resistive switching mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics underlying reset in bipolar resistive memory has been the subject of decades of controversy and has been identified as the primary barrier to resistive memory technology development. This manuscript introduces a nanoscale effect in current carrying conductors, whereby surface charge induced radial electric fields are found to be inversely proportional to the radius of the conductive path. This nanoscale effect is then applied to explain the negative resistance switching (reset) mechanism in filamentary metal oxide resistive switching memory devices (memristors). Previous explanations for the negative resistive switching mechanism state that diffusion constitutes the radial driving mechanism for oxygen ions, and drift under electric fields is restricted to the direction parallel to current flow. This explanation conflicts with retention and microscopy data collected in a subset of devices presented in literature. We demonstrate that the electric field's dependency on the on the radius of a nanoscale conductive path can result in radial fields on the order of 10^5 to 10^6 V/cm at only -1 V bias, sufficient to govern the negative resistance switching mechanism in filamentary metal oxides. By accounting for this nanoscale size effect, long standing anomalous experimental data about the negative (reset) resistance switching mechanism in bipolar filamentary resistive memory devices is finally reconciled. Wide understanding of surface charges and associated electric fields in nanoscale conductive paths could prove important for further scaling of integrated circuits and aid in elucidating many nanoscale phenomena.</description>

      <title>Transport signatures of topological commensurate off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum transport and topology in a one-dimensional off-diagonal commensurate Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) chain. The model, formulated within AAH framework, effectively represents a one-dimensional lattice with two competing commensurate modulations, supporting two distinct types of topological edge modes: zero-energy states in the central gapless region and quantum Hall (QH) edge states bridging the gapped bulk bands. These edge modes govern the transport behavior and give rise to sharp variations in transmission across the corresponding gap-closing transitions. A pronounced even-odd effect further emerges, where chains with an odd number of sites exhibit nearly perfect zero-energy transmission at the Dirac points, independent of system-lead coupling, system size, or modulation strength; a robust signature of ballistic transport. To capture the influence of environmental decoherence, we also incorporate B\"uttiker dephasing probes, which enable a phenomenological description of inelastic scattering and reveal how dephasing modifies, and in some regimes enhances, coherent transport.</description>

      <title>Compact self-matched gyrators using edge magnetoplasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal microwave components are indispensable in quantum information processing and cryogenic measurement. Conventional implementations, however, are bulky and incompatible with on-chip scalable integration. Recent efforts to develop compact on-chip alternatives often rely on active modulation or complex circuit architectures, which introduce additional losses and degrade performance. We demonstrate the realization of compact, self-impedance-matched gyrators based on edge magnetoplasmons in a two-dimensional electron gas. Gyrators can be used as building blocks for other non-reciprocal elements such as isolators and circulators. Our devices achieve gyration from 0.2 to 2 GHz, tunable by moderate out-of plane magnetic fields below 400 mT, and sub-mm footprint, two orders of magnitude smaller than conventional ferrite-based components. Using an electrode geometry predicted to minimize reflections, we achieve insertion losses as low as 2 to 4 dB. The self-matched design framework we utilize is broadly applicable, and can be implemented in a wide variety of non-reciprocal device architectures.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of propagating spin waves in a spin-Hall nano-oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constriction-based spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) show great promise for application as highly tunable microwave sources with straightforward scalability toward large coupled networks. However, details of the magnetization dynamics within SHNOs have thus far not been addressed experimentally, due to the minute time and length scales involved. In this work, we present direct imaging of the magnetization dynamics within a single CoFeB-based SHNO using time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM). Our measurements reveal that the magnon amplitude is the strongest at the two constriction edges, with a pronounced assymetry favoring one edge, and that emitted spin waves exhibit strongly anisotropic propagation. Micromagnetic simulations suggest that grain boundaries and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) play a key role in both effects. Furthermore, the magnetodynamics changed during the measurement, indicating that the CoFeB/MgO interface may be more susceptible to X-ray induced modifications than previously recognized, challenging its presumed radiation hardness.</description>

      <title>Color Centers and Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: A New Platform for Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPPs) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) confine mid-infrared light to deep-subwavelength scales and may offer a powerful route to strong light-matter interactions. Generation and control of HPPs are typically accessed using classical near-field probes, which limits experiments at the quantum level.A complementary frontier in hBN research focuses on color centers: bright, stable, atomically localized emitters that have rapidly emerged as a promising platform for solid-state quantum optics. Here we establish a key connection between these two directions by developing a cavity-QED framework in which a single hBN color center serves as a quantum source of HPPs. We quantify the emitter-HPP interaction and analyze two generation schemes. The first is spontaneous emission into the phonon sideband, which can produce single-HPP events and, in ultrathin slabs, becomes single-mode with an enhanced decay rate. The second is a stimulated Raman process that provides frequency selectivity, tunable conversion rate, and narrowband excitation. This drive launches spatially confined, ray-like HPPs that propagate over micrometer distances. We also outline a two-emitter correlation measurement that can directly test the single-polariton character of these emissions. By connecting color-center quantum optics with hyperbolic polaritonics, our approach enables quantum emitters to act as on-chip quantum sources and controls for HPPs, while HPPs provide long-range channels that couple spatially separated emitters. Together, these capabilities point to a new direction for mid-infrared photonic experiments that unite strong coupling, spectral selectivity, and spatial reach within a single material system.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermoelectric and thermal Hall effects in irradiated altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we show that a $d$-wave altermagnet can be transformed into a Chern insulator by irradiating it with elliptically polarized light from a high-frequency photon beam. We further explore the intrinsic anomalous thermoelectric and thermal Hall effects in light-irradiated altermagnets. At extremely low temperatures, the thermoelectric Hall coefficient, which exhibits a linear temperature dependence for the thermoelectric Hall conductivity, vanishes within the gapped region between the conduction and valence bands. However, it displays peaks and dips at the boundaries of the gap, suggesting that thermoelectric Hall conductivity can be used to probe the bandwidth. Similarly, the low-temperature thermal Hall coefficient, which also shows a linear temperature dependence for the thermal Hall conductivity, becomes quantized in the gapped region between the conduction and valence bands. This quantization indicates that thermal Hall conductivity can serve as a probe for the topological properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the emergence of quantum jumps in a monitored qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum jumps, the collapse of a quantum system upon measurement, are among the most striking consequences of observation in quantum mechanics. While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.</description>

      <title>Vertical Nb Josephson junctions fabricated by direct metal deposition on both surfaces of freestanding graphene layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical integration of superconducting electronics requires fabrication strategies that preserve pristine interfaces while accommodating oxidation-sensitive elemental superconductors. However, existing van der Waals-based vertical Josephson junctions largely rely on transfer-based assembly schemes that are incompatible with elemental materials such as niobium (Nb). Here, we introduce a freestanding van der Waals membrane architecture that enables deposition-based fabrication of vertical Josephson junctions through double-sided processing of a single suspended two-dimensional layer. Using multilayer graphene suspended across lithographically defined through-holes in a SiNx membrane, we realize vertical Nb/multilayer graphene/Nb Josephson junctions without ambient exposure of buried interfaces. The resulting devices exhibit clear Josephson coupling, including reproducible supercurrents and a temperature dependence of the critical current consistent with short-junction behaviour. Well-defined magnetic interference patterns governed by the membrane-defined aperture geometry, together with sub-gap features that track a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like superconducting gap, further confirm the junction quality. This platform establishes a scalable route to vertical superconducting devices based on oxidation-sensitive elemental superconductors and van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Spin current generation via magnetic skyrmion, bimeron, and meron crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin current offers a promising route toward energy-efficient and high-speed information processing. Developing efficient methods for their generation remains a central challenge in spintronics. Here, we investigate spin current generation via two-dimensional topological spin textures: a skyrmion crystal (SkX) with out-of-plane magnetization, a bimeron crystal (BmX) with in-plane magnetization, and a meron crystal (MX) with zero net magnetization. We show that these distinct spin textures generate spin currents with characteristic spin polarization directions. In the absence of spin--orbit coupling, the SkX and BmX generate spin currents polarized along their magnetization directions, whereas the MX yields no spin current. Upon introducing spin--orbit coupling, while the behavior of the SkX does not qualitatively change, the BmX generates nonzero spin currents in multiple polarization directions. Notably, the MX, despite its zero net magnetization, exhibits a pronounced spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization, driven by an enhanced spin Berry curvature associated with characteristic band degeneracy. We further demonstrate that the electronic and spin transport properties of each texture are governed by their magnetic symmetries. Our results highlight the topological spin textures as efficient sources of spin current even without net magnetization, expanding the design for spintronics devices based on topological magnetic metals.</description>

      <title>Quasi-One-Dimensional Electronic Nature of Ta4SiTe4 Underlying the Giant Thermoelectric Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ta4SiTe4 is a one-dimensional van der Waals material that exhibits an exceptionally large thermoelectric power factor below room temperature. However, since this material has been available only in the form of acicular microcrystals, experimental exploration of the electronic properties responsible for its giant thermoelectric performance has long been challenging. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the one-dimensional electronic nature of Ta4SiTe4 by combining micro-spot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport measurements on focused-ion-beam-processed samples. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal anisotropic band dispersions along and perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. Consistently, transport measurements demonstrate that the resistivity perpendicular to the c axis is approximately five times larger than that along the c axis at 200 K. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the quasi-one-dimensional electronic character of Ta4SiTe4, which underlies its giant thermoelectric response reported previously, and offer fundamental insights into the role of electronic dimensionality in enhancing thermoelectric performance.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in Atomically Thin Metallic TaNiTe$_5$ with Ultrahigh Carrier Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric metals, characterized by the coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallic conductivity, present a fundamental challenge due to the screening effect of free charge carriers on the long-range electric dipole order. Existing strategies to circumvent this obstacle include employing two-dimensional (2D) crystals, where reduced dimensionality and low carrier densities suppress screening, or designing materials of van der Waals (vdW) superlattice with spatially separated and decoupled conductive and nearly insulating ferroelectric layers. Here, we report an alternative paradigm in TaNiTe5, where an ultrahigh carrier density coexists with an out-of-plane ferroelectric order within the same surface monolayer. Using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), we observed robust ferroelectric behavior in TaNiTe5 down to single-unit-cell thickness (~1.3 nm) at room temperature. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) gives structural evidence that the ferroelectricity might originate from the vertical displacement of outmost Te atoms on the surface, breaking the inversion symmetry. Concurrently, electrical transport measurements reveal a metallic state with a carrier density on the order of 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ (or 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$) -- comparable to that of Copper (Cu). Our findings establish a unique platform for exploring the interplay between ferroelectricity and an ultrahigh density of mobile carriers in the 2D limit.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide an accurate description of geometric phases emerging in simple optical systems -- nanostructures (metaatoms) interacting with vortex beams. We show that this interaction leads to a new class of geometric phase for optical beams, which is different from the geometric phases commonly discussed in structured-light optics. We compare this setting to the usual description of geometric phases for beams and show that the underlying geometry is different.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the formation of ferron-polariton - a hybrid light-matter quasiparticle arising from the coupling between collective ferroelectric excitations (ferrons) and Swihart photons in a superconductor/ferroelectric/superconductor heterostructure. The coupling provides direct evidence for ferrons and reaches the ultrastrong-coupling regime, with a spectral gap in the terahertz range, orders of magnitude larger than those in magnetic analogues, reflecting the superior strength of electric dipole interactions.

      <title>Platform and Framework for Time-Resolved Nanoscale Thermal Transport Measurements in STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding heat transport at the nanometer scale is critical for semiconductor devices, quantum materials, and thermal management of nanostructures, yet direct local measurements of thermal conductivity and heat capacity remain scarce. We developed a laser-excitation system integrated into a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) for nanoscale thermal transport measurements using ultra-high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). A fiber-coupled laser is introduced via a modified aperture mechanism, enabling flexible holder geometries and large tilt angles without optical elements in the polepiece gap. Synchronization of pulsed laser excitation with an externally gated direct electron detector provides temporal resolution about 50 ns at &lt;10 meV energy resolution. Local temperatures are determined via the principle of detailed balance, and thermal transport parameters are extracted by fitting a forward-time central-space heat diffusion model including radiative losses. For amorphous carbon films, we obtain a thermal conductivity of 1.24 $\frac{W}{m\cdot K}$ and a heat capacity of 821 $\frac{J}{kg\cdot K}$, consistent with literature. This framework enables time-resolved nanoscale measurements of thermal transport in materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>Torsional Hall Viscosity of Massive Chern Insulators: Magnetic Field and Momentum Deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the non-dissipative, parity-odd spin transport of $(2+1)$-dimensional relativistic electrons, generated by torsion, and the torsional Hall viscosity $\zeta_{\rm H}$. We first determine $\zeta_{\rm H}$ for massive Dirac fermions in the presence of a constant electromagnetic field. We predict that the magnetic field induces a contribution to $\zeta_{\rm H}$ competing with the one originating from the Dirac mass. Moreover, we quantify the impact on $\zeta_{\rm H}$ originating from the band structure deformation quadratic in momentum terms that was proposed by Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ). We find that the BHZ deformation substantially enhances $\zeta_{\rm H}$ in magnitude as measured in a domain wall configuration, when compared to the free Dirac fermion result. Nevertheless, the torsional Hall viscosity still discriminates between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes. Our results, hence, pave the way for a deeper understanding of hydrodynamic spin transport and its possible verification in experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of magnetic octupole in periodic crystals and application to $d$-wave altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic multipoles have been recognized as order parameters characterizing magnetic structure in solids. Recently, magnetic octupoles have been proposed as the order parameters of time-reversal-symmetry breaking centrosymmetric antiferromagnets exhibiting nonrelativistic spin splitting, which is referred to as ``altermagnet''. However, a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic octupoles in crystalline solids remains elusive. Here, we present a gauge-invariant expression of spin magnetic octupoles in periodic crystals based on quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, which can be used to quantitatively characterize time-reversal-symmetry breaking antiferromagnets including $d$-wave altermagnets. The allowed physical response tensors are classified beyond symmetry considerations, and direct relationships are established for some of them in insulators at zero temperature. Furthermore, our expression reveals a contribution from an anisotropic magnetic dipole, which has the same symmetry as conventional spin and orbital magnetic dipoles but carries no net magnetization. We discuss the relation between the anisotropic magnetic dipole and the anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the topological spin of Majoranas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana zero modes make them interesting for both technological applications and fundamental research. Unlike their non-Abelian counterpart, the Abelian contribution, $e^{i\theta}$, where $\theta$ is directly related to the Majorana's topological spin, is often neglected. However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin can differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors, the Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising from a vortex encircling a $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this fractional charge, and hence the topological spin, can be manipulated through the control of device geometry, introducing an additional control knob for topological quantum computing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment that reveals the presence of this fractional charge through shifts in the critical current.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature spin-lifetime anisotropy exceeding 60 in bilayer graphene spin valves proximity coupled to WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spins in bilayer graphene (BLG) can be achieved by spin-orbit proximity coupling of graphene to transition metal dichalcogenides. This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</description>

Abstract: We show that periodically time-modulating the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in a two-dimensional magnon insulator may induce a topological phase transition that results in the presence of robust edge modes. To this end, we study a square lattice of spins interacting via an XXZ Heisenberg model with a ferromagnetic longitudinal coupling and antiferromagnetic transverse coupling, as well as the aforementioned time-modulated DMI. The topologically protected edge states of this system are composed of coherent superpositions of single-magnon excitations and two magnon bound states. Furthermore, we show that the chirality of the edge states can be controlled by adjusting the relative phase for the drive on the DMI associated with nearest neighbors in the x and y directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Klein tunneling stands as a fundamental probe of relativistic quantum transport in two-dimensional materials. We investigate this phenomenon in quadratic band-touching systems, where the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance plays a central role in the underlying mechanism. By employing a generic parabolic model, we systematically disentangle the cooperative effects of intrinsic mass asymmetry and tunable quantum geometry. We demonstrate that mass asymmetry sets the overall transmission profile, including the angular distribution and the resonance channels. In contrast, we show that quantum geometry provides a universal parameter that modulates tunneling efficiency by tuning the quantum distance, while leaving the energy dispersion unchanged. Specifically, quantum geometry plays a dual role: it governs the overall transmission amplitude through pseudospin mismatch, while its interplay with Fabry-Perot interference induces observable shifts in resonance angles. Our findings reveal that incorporating quantum geometry alongside band structure is essential for a complete description of quantum transport.</description>

Abstract: We study the formation of hybrid plasmon-magnon modes in a heterostructure comprising a monolayer semiconductor with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling -- specifically, Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) -- and an insulating ferrimagnet, such as yttrium iron garnet-based compounds. Using a combined microscopic-macroscopic framework for plasmon-magnon coupling, we show that plasmons and magnons strongly hybridize over both GHz and THz frequency ranges, enabling experimental access well above cryogenic temperatures. Moreover, the developed approach provides an efficient and natural classification of the topology of the hybrid modes, rooted in the phase winding of the plasmon-magnon coupling induced by spin-momentum locking and the associated chiral winding of the electronic spin along the Fermi contours. Finally, we identify experimentally accessible manifestations of the hybridization, such as topological interface modes and an anomalous thermal Hall response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipative stabilization of cat qubits autonomously corrects for bit flip errors by ensuring that reservoir-engineered two-photon losses dominate over other mechanisms inducing phase flip errors. To describe the latter, we derive an effective master equation for an asymmetrically threaded SQUID based superconducting circuit used to stabilize a dissipative cat qubit. We analyze the dressing of relaxation processes under drives in time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory for weakly anharmonic bosonic degrees of freedom, and in numerically exact Floquet theory. We find that spurious single-photon decay rates can increase under the action of the parametric pump that generates the required interactions for cat-qubit stabilization. Our analysis feeds into mitigation strategies that can inform current experiments, and the methods presented here can be extended to other circuit implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts temporarily degrade qubit coherence which can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allows us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of five. This reduction falls four orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of replacement-type quantum gates. This type of gate introduces input qubits, candidate qubits, and output qubits. The candidate qubits are prepared such, that a displacement conditional on the input qubit results in the targeted output state. Finally, the circuit continues with the output qubits constructed from the candidate qubits instead of the input qubits, thus the name "replacement-type gate". We present examples of replacement-type $X$ and $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates realized with spin qubits and with neutral atom qubits with error rates predicted near the threshold of the XZZX surface code. By making use of the extended Hilbert space, including the position of the particles, these gates approximately preserve the innate noise bias of the qubits. The gate preserves the noise bias which motivates advanced quantum computer architectures with quantum error correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for calculating exciton spectra and wavefunctions for model lattice Hamiltonians, based on real-space electron-hole propagators. We verify that our results agree with those of the continuum approximation in the limit of large Wannier excitons, and propose a simple criterion to estimate the exciton size above which the continuum approximation is quantitatively accurate. We then investigate simple one- and two-dimensional multi-orbital lattice models and show that small, Frenkel-like excitons, whose size approaches the lattice constant, can display physics that disagrees with the simplest continuum descriptions (a single-valley quadratic expansion around the minimum gap) not just quantitatively, but qualitatively. Specifically, we identify sharp transitions in the character and momentum of the lowest-energy exciton, enabled by the multi-orbital nature of the lattice models.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Dome in Ionic Liquid Gated Homoepitaxial Strontium Titanate Thin Films</title>

Abstract: In this work, we patterned a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) on the surface of a SrTiO$_3$ thin film grown homoepitaxially on SrTiO$_3$ by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE). We explored the superconducting dome in this material system by tuning electron density with ionic liquid gating. We found superconducting transitions up to 503 mK near an optimal electron density of approximately 3 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This is a meaningful increase from the typical optimal transition near 350 mK in similar 2DEGs on SrTiO$_3$ single crystal substrate surfaces. Systematic tuning of 2DEG electron density revealed a consistent BCS scaling between superconducting critical temperature, coherence length, and electron mean free path. Substantial variation of transition width across the dome was described by a paraconductivity model combining Aslamazov-Larkin and Maki-Thompson contributions.</description>

      <title>Modified Langevin noise formalism for multiple quantum emitters in dispersive electromagnetic environments out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of interactions among quantum emitters through nanophotonic structures offers significant opportunities for quantum technologies. However, a rigorous theoretical description of the interaction of multiple quantum emitters with complex, dispersive dielectric objects remains challenging. Here, we introduce an approach based on the modified Langevin noise formalism that unveils the roles of both the noise polarization currents of the dielectrics and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field scattered by the dielectrics. This work extends Refs. \cite{miano_quantum_2025} and \cite{miano_spectral_2025} to the general case of an arbitrary number of emitters. The proposed approach allows us to describe the dynamics of the quantum emitters for arbitrary initial quantum states of the electromagnetic environment, consisting of two independent bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density matrix. Specifically, we examine situations where both reservoirs are initially in thermal quantum states but have different temperatures. Understanding how these reservoirs shape the dynamics of the emitters is crucial for understanding light-matter interactions in complex electromagnetic environments and for improving intrinsic emitter properties within structured environments.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Response of a Half-Filled Chern Band near Topological Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate electromagnetic-response observables in a half-filled Chern band, across a topological phase transition between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a Fermi liquid (FL) phase. While a sharp gapped plasma mode exists deep in the CFL phase, we demonstrate that it is damped near the proposed continuous phase transition between CFL and FL. This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions.</description>
