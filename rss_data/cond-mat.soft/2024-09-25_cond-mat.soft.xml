      <title>Effects of collective patterns, confinement, and fluid flow on active particle transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-organization of active particles on a two-dimensional single-occupancy lattice is investigated, with an emphasis on the effects of boundary confinement and the influence of an external mean fluid flow. The study examines collective behaviors, particularly the transition from a disordered phase to the formation of orientationally ordered patterns, and their impact on particle transport and flux. In the absence of fluid flow, confinement causes particles to accumulate near the walls, leading to clogs or obstructions that hinder movement, or to the formation of bands aligned with the channel. Although these bands limit the particles ability to freely self-propel, they still result in a net flux along the channel. The introduction of an external Poiseuille fluid flow induces vorticity, shifts the phase transition to higher alignment sensitivities, and promotes particle clustering at the channel center, significantly enhancing overall flux.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Method to Play with Porosity and Particle Size Distribution for Characterizing Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents a simulation method for investigating the relationship between porosity and particle size distribution in porous media characterization. The method simulates particle packing based on particle size distributions, incorporating descent and collision rules to mimic the natural deposition process while minimizing boundary-induced porosity distortions. By systematically varying the mean particle size and standard deviation, multiple packed structures are generated, and their corresponding porosities are calculated. This approach offers a flexible and scalable tool for exploring the impact of particle size distribution on porosity, providing both qualitative and quantitative insights into porous media properties.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to the osmotic second virial coefficient of protein solutions and its application to liquid liquid phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The osmotic second virial coefficient B2 is an important parameter to describe the interactions and phase behavior of protein solutions, including colloidal systems and macromolecular solutions. Another key parameter to describe the driving force of the nucleation of a new phase is the supersaturation, which is used in the classical nucleation theory framework and is connected with the favorable contribution in the Gibbs free energy in the bulk solution. In this article, we establish a connection between B2 calculated from small angle Xray scattering (SAXS) data and the values of B2 obtained from supersaturation measurements using thermodynamics considerations. The values of the second virial coefficient calculated employing this method agree with those determined via SAXS in the region near the liquid liquid phase separation border for human serum albumin and bovine serum albumin. The general relations adopted are shown to be useful for the estimation of the second virial coefficient B2 for globular proteins, in the proximity of the binodal biphasic coexistent region.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of the Spatial Statistics of Random and Defined-Sequence Photoresist Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resolution-line edge roughness-sensitivity tradeoff has motivated exploration of potential improvements using defined sequence polymers and polymer-bound photoacid generators and quenchers. In this study we characterize the internal structures of positive tone photoresist polymer films formed from defined sequence polymers and compare them to random copolymers of the same composition. We model their imaging to connect initial to developable film structures. We use a polymer packing algorithm to simulate films of diverse compositions and locations of photoacid generators and quenchers, using the composition of an ESCAP photoresist. We use a simple EUV exposure-deprotection algorithm to model developable image formation within them. In all cases, the spatial distribution of chemical moieties in the film for defined sequence polymers is nearly indistinguishable from random copolymers. We evaluate several exposure-deprotection scenarios, and find that a defined sequence copolymer has a distinctive developable image under certain circumstances. The use of defined sequence polymers within a photoresist layer does not automatically result in improved imaging, however they do have some characteristics different from random polymers of the same composition. Further study of these characteristics may provide a route to improved control over the nanoscale imaging process.</description>

      <title>Programmable Motion of Optically Gated Electrically Powered Engineered Microswimmer Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report on a new class active particles capable of dynamically programmable motion powered by electricity. We have implemented physical principles that separate the propulsion and steering mechanisms of active motion using optically activated, patterned, photoresponsive semiconductor coatings on intricate microstructures. Our engineered microswimmer robots employ an induced-charge electro-phoresis (ICEP) mechanism to achieve linear motion and optically modulated electrokinetic propulsion (OMEP) for steering. Optical modulation is achieved by manipulating the polarizability of patterned ZnO semiconductor coating through exposure to light with wavelengths above its bandgap, exploiting the semiconductor's photoconductive properties. Unlike previous methods that rely on changing the direction of optical illumination or spatially controlling narrow optical beams, our approach achieves optical steering under uniform ambient illumination conditions, thereby greatly reducing the complexity of the optical system. The decoupling of propulsion and steering allows for the programming of micromotor trajectories in both open and closed-loop control modes. We anticipate that our findings will pave the way for efficient optically gated control of the trajectory of photoresponsive active particles. Furthermore, they will enable the selective manipulation of specific subgroups of engineered active microparticles with various semiconducting coatings having different band gaps.</description>

      <title>Turbulence to Order Transitions in Activity Patterned Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study two-dimensional active nematics with periodic activity patterning. For stripes of activity, we observe a transition from two-dimensional to one-dimensional active turbulence as the maximum active force and distance between activity stripes increases, followed by a transition to stable vortices ordered antiferromagnetically along the stripes and ferromagnetically transverse to the stripes. If the stripes are replaced by columns of activity circles, the vortex ordering is lost. A triangular lattice of activity circles can induce the formation of two-dimensional active turbulence. Our results provide a mechanism for inducing non-equilibrium phase transitions in active nematics using activity inhomogeneity, which can be exploited to create activity patterned ordered phases.</description>

      <title>Condensate Size Control by Charge Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are complex droplets comprising many different types of molecules that interact using various mechanisms. Condensation is often driven by short-ranged attraction, but net charges can also mediate long-ranged repulsion. Using molecular dynamics simulations and an equilibrium field theory, we show that such opposing interactions can suppress coarsening so that many droplets of equal size coexist at equilibrium. This size control depends strongly on the charge asymmetry between constituents, while the strength of the short-ranged attractions has a weak influence. Our work reveals how electrostatic effects control droplet size, which is relevant for understanding biomolecular condensates and creating synthetic patterns in chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a fluid flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions. The fluid imposes elastic, viscous, and active stresses on such surfaces, which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stress in a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two-dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring the active stresses in active anisotropic biological systems. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Hyperdisordered cell packing on a growing surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ''hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.</description>

      <title>Avalanche criticality emerges by thermal fluctuation in a quiescent glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report avalanche criticality of thermal relaxation in glassy systems after a rapid quench by molecular simulation. Our analysis of the energy landscape and the scaling reveals that particle rearrangement is critical. The critical phenomenon has the same origin as avalanches in sheared amorphous solids, but the critical exponent differs from previously observed. Our results suggest that by viewing a glass as a thermally driven elastoplastic material, we can understand dynamics below the glass transition point, such as aging.</description>

      <title>The interplay between membrane viscosity and ligand-binding receptor kinetics in lipid bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma membranes appear as deformable systems wherein molecules are free to move and diffuse giving rise to condensed microdomains (composed of ordered lipids, transmembrane proteins and cholesterol) surrounded by disordered lipid molecules. Such denser and thicker regions, namely lipid rafts, are important communication hubs for cells. Indeed, recent experiments revealed how the most of active signaling proteins co-localize on such domains, thereby intensifying the biochemical trafficking of substances. From a material standpoint, it is reasonable to assume the bilayer as a visco-elastic body accounting for both in-plane fluidity and elasticity. Consequently, lipid rafts contribute to membrane heterogeneity by typically exhibiting higher stiffness and viscosity and by locally altering the bilayer dynamics and proteins activity. A chemo-mechanical model of lipid bilayer coupled with interspecific dynamics among the resident species (typically transmembrane receptors and trasporters) has been recently formulated to explain and predict how proteins regulate the dynamic heterogeneity of membrane. However, the explicit inclusion of the membrane viscosity in the model was not considered. To this aim, the present work enriches the constitutive description of the bilayer by modeling its visco-elastic behavior. This is done through a strain-level dependent viscosity able to theoretically trace back the alteration of membrane fluidity experimentally observed in lipid phase transitions. This provides new insights into how the quasi-solid and fluid components of lipid membrane response interact with the evolution of resident proteins by affecting the activity of raft domains, with effects on cell mechano-signaling.</description>

      <title>Normalized topological indices discriminate between architectures of branched macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branching architecture characterizes numerous systems, ranging from synthetic (hyper)branched polymers and biomolecules such as lignin, amylopectin, and nucleic acids to tracheal and neuronal networks. Its ubiquity reflects the many favourable properties that arise because of it. For instance, branched macromolecules are spatially compact and have a high surface functionality, which impacts their phase characteristics and self-assembly behaviour, among others. The relationship between branching and physical properties has been studied by mapping macromolecules to mathematical trees whose architecture can be characterized using topological indices. These indices, however, do not allow for a comparison of macromolecules that map to trees of different size, be it due to different mapping procedures or differences in their molecular weight. To alleviate this, we introduce a novel normalization of topological indices using estimates of their probability density functions. We determine two optimal normalized topological indices and construct a phase space that enables a robust discrimination between different architectures of branched macromolecules. We demonstrate the necessity of such a phase space on two practical applications, one being ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules with various branching topologies and the other different methods of coarse-graining branched macromolecules. Our approach can be applied to any type of branched molecules and extended as needed to other topological indices, making it useful across a wide range of fields where branched molecules play an important role, including polymer physics, green chemistry, bioengineering, biotechnology, and medicine.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation on Deformable Membranes: interplay of mechanical coupling and dynamic surface geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-organization of proteins into enriched compartments and the formation of complex patterns are crucial processes for life on the cellular level. Liquid-liquid phase separation is one mechanism for forming such enriched compartments. When phase-separating proteins are membrane-bound and locally disturb it, the mechanical response of the membrane mediates interactions between these proteins. How these membrane-mediated interactions influence the steady state of the protein density distribution is thus an important question to investigate in order to understand the rich diversity of protein and membrane-shape patterns present at the cellular level. This work starts with a widely used model for membrane-bound phase-separating proteins. We numerically solve our system to map out its phase space and perform a careful, systematic expansion of the model equations to characterize the phase transitions through linear stability analysis and free energy arguments. We observe that the membrane-mediated interactions, due to their long-range nature, are capable of qualitatively altering the equilibrium state of the proteins. This leads to arrested coarsening and length-scale selection instead of simple demixing and complete coarsening. In this study, we unambiguously show that long-range membrane-mediated interactions lead to pattern formation in a system that otherwise would not do so. This work provides a basis for further systematic study of membrane-bound pattern-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Epithelial Tissues from the Bottom-Up: Contact Inhibition, Wound Healing, and Force Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In processes such as embryo shaping, wound healing, and malignant cell invasion, epithelial cells transition between dispersed phases, where the cells move independently, and condensed phases, where they aggregate and deform to close gaps, forming confluent tissues. Understanding how cells regulate these transitions and how these transitions differ from those of inert particles remains an open challenge. Addressing these questions requires linking the macroscopic properties of tissues to the mechanical characteristics and active responses of individual cells, driven by sub-cellular processes. Here, we introduce a computational model that incorporates key factors such as cell deformability, lamellipodium-driven dynamics, cell-junction-mediated adhesion, and contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL)-a process where cells alter their motion upon contact with others. We demonstrate how these factors, along with cell density, regulate the dynamical and mechanical properties of tissues. We show that CIL imparts unique living-like behaviors to cells and tissues by reducing density fluctuations. This reduction in fluctuations affects the dynamics: it inhibits cell motion in steady states but promotes it in the presence of gaps, accelerating wound healing. Furthermore, the stabilization of tensile states by CIL, which would otherwise fracture, enables the formation of tensile force chains.</description>

      <title>Interfacial performance evolution of ceramics-in-polymer composite electrolyte in solid-state lithium metal batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incorporation of ceramics into polymers, forming solid composite electrolytes (SCEs) leads to enhanced electrical performance of all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. This is because the dispersed ceramics particles increase the ionic conductivity, while the polymer matrix leads to better contact performance between the electrolyte and the electrode. In this study, we present a model, based on Hybrid Elements Methods, for the time-dependent Li metal and SCE rough interface mechanics, taking into account for the oxide (ceramics) inclusions (using the Equivalent Inclusion method), and the viscoelasticity of the matrix. We study the effect of LLTO particle size, weight concentration, and spatial distribution on the interface mechanical and electrical response. Moreover, considering the viscoelastic spectrum of a real PEO matrix, under a given stack pressure, we investigate the evolution over time of the mechanical and electrical performance of the interface. The presented theoretical/numerical model might be pivotal in tailoring the development of advanced solid state batteries with superior performance; indeed, we found that conditions in the SCE mixture which optimize both the contact resistivity and the interface stability in time.</description>

      <title>An Informatics Framework for the Design of Sustainable, Chemically Recyclable, Synthetically-Accessible and Durable Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to design durable and chemically recyclable ring-opening polymerization (ROP) class polymers. This approach employs digital reactions using virtual forward synthesis (VFS) to generate over 7 million ROP polymers and machine learning techniques to rapidly predict thermal, thermodynamic and mechanical properties crucial for application-specific performance and recyclability. This combined methodology enables the generation and evaluation of millions of hypothetical ROP polymers from known and commercially available molecules, guiding the selection of approximately 35,000 candidates with optimal features for sustainability and practical utility. Three of these recommended candidates have passed validation tests in the physical lab - two of the three by others, as published previously elsewhere, and one of them is a new thiocane polymer synthesized, tested and reported here. This paper presents the framework, methodology, and initial findings of our study, highlighting the potential of VFS and machine learning to enable a large-scale search of the polymer universe and advance the development of recyclable and environmentally benign polymers.</description>

      <title>Martignac: Computational workflows for reproducible, traceable, and composable coarse-grained Martini simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their wide use and far-reaching implications, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from a lack of both traceability and reproducibility. We introduce Martignac: computational workflows for the coarse-grained (CG) Martini force field. Martignac describes Martini CG MD simulations as an acyclic directed graph, providing the entire history of a simulation -- from system preparation to property calculations. Martignac connects to NOMAD, such that all simulation data generated are automatically normalized and stored according to the FAIR principles. We present several prototypical Martini workflows, including system generation of simple liquids and bilayers, as well as free-energy calculations for solute solvation in homogeneous liquids and drug permeation in lipid bilayers. By connecting to the NOMAD database to automatically pull existing simulations and push any new simulation generated, Martignac contributes to improving the sustainability and reproducibility of molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>The Viscosity of Liquids in the Dual Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable model of viscosity in liquids using a dual liquid model framework is developed. The analytical expression arrived at exhibits the correct T-dependence Arrhenius-like. It is compared with the values of viscosity for water with acceptable accuracy and those related to the mechano-thermal effect in liquids under low-frequency shear. It has even been shown that a numerical approach of viscosity in liquids dealt with as dual systems provides good agreement with experimental data. The expression of viscosity shows an explicit dependence upon the sound velocity and the collective vibratory degrees of freedom excited at a given temperature. The terms involved depend upon the Boltzmann and Planck constants. Finally, the physical model is coherent with the postulate of microscopic reversibility as well as with the time's arrow for macroscopic dissipative mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple and popular Bridgman's formula predicts a linear correlation between the thermal conductivity coefficient and the sound velocity of dense liquids. Unfortunately, it cannot be applied to strongly coupled plasma-related fluids, because the sound velocity can greatly increase as screening weakens. We propose a modification of the Bridgman formula by correlating the thermal conductivity coefficient with the transverse (shear) sound velocity. This approach is demonstrated to work reasonably well in screened Coulomb (Yukawa) fluids and can be useful in the context of complex (dusty) plasmas.</description>

      <title>Emergent Strategies for Shepherding a Flock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how a shepherd should move to effectively herd a flock towards a target. Using an agent-based (ABM) and a coarse-grained (ODE) model for the flock, we pose and solve for the optimal strategy of a shepherd that must keep the flock cohesive and coerce it towards a target. Three distinct strategies emerge naturally as a function of the scaled herd size {and} the scaled shepherd speed: (i) mustering, where the shepherd circles the herd to ensure compactness, (ii) droving, where the shepherd chases the herd in a desired direction while sweeping back and forth, and (iii) driving, where the flock surrounds a shepherd that drives it from within. A minimal dynamical model for the size, shape, and position of the herd captures the effective behavior of the ABM and further allows us to characterize the different herding strategies in terms of the behavior of the shepherd that librates (mustering), oscillates (droving), or moves steadily (driving).</description>

      <title>Multiple temperatures and melting of a colloidal active crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal fluctuations constantly and evenly excite all vibrational modes in an equilibrium crystal. As the temperature rises, these fluctuations promote the formation of defects and eventually melting. In active solids, the self-propulsion of "atomic" units provides another source of strong non-equilibrium fluctuations whose effect on the melting scenario is still largely unexplored. Here we show that when a colloidal crystal is activated by a bath of swimming bacteria, solvent temperature and active temperature cooperate to define dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Our system consists of repulsive paramagnetic particles confined in two dimensions and immersed in a bath of light-driven E. coli. The relative balance between fluctuations and interactions can be adjusted in two ways: by changing the strength of the magnetic field and by tuning activity with light. When the persistence time of active fluctuations is short, a single effective temperature controls both the amplitudes of vibrational modes and the melting transition. For more persistent active noise, energy equipartition is broken and multiple temperatures emerge, whereas melting occurs before the Lindemann parameter reaches its equilibrium critical value. We show that this phenomenology is fully confirmed by numerical simulations and can be framed within a minimal model of a single active particle in a periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoresis of ionic catalytic particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A migration of charged particles relative to a solvent, caused by a gradient of salt concentration and termed a diffusiophoresis, is of much interest being exploited in many fields. Existing theories deal with diffusiophoresis of passive inert particles. In this paper, we extend prior models by focusing on a particle, which is both passive and catalytic, by postulating an uniform ion release over its surface. We derive an expression for a particle velocity depending on a dimensionless ion flux (Damkohler number Da) and show that a charged region is formed at distances of the order of the particle size, provided the diffusion coefficients of anions and cations are unequal. When Da becomes large enough, the contribution of this (outer) region to the particle velocity dominates. In this case the speed of catalytic passive particles augments linearly with Da and is inversely proportional to the square of electrolyte concentration. As a result, they always migrate towards a high concentration region and in dilute solutions become much faster than inert (non-catalytic) ones.</description>

      <title>Particle scale anisotropy controls bulk properties in sheared granular materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk dynamics of dense granular materials arise through a combination of particle-scale and mesoscale effects. Theoretical and numerical studies have shown that collective effects are created by particle-scale anisotropic structures such as grain connectivity (fabric), force transmission, and frictional mobilization, all of which influence bulk properties like bulk friction and the stress tensor through the Stress-Force-Fabric (SFF) relationship. To date, establishing the relevance of these effects to laboratory systems has remained elusive due to the challenge of measuring both normal and frictional contact forces at the particle scale. In this study, we perform experiments on a sheared photoelastic granular system in an quasi-2D annular (Couette) cell. During these experiments, we measure particle locations, contacts, and normal and frictional forces vectors during loading. We reconstruct the angular distributions of the contact and force vectors, and extract the corresponding emergent anisotropies for each of these metrics. Finally, we show that the SFF relation quantitatively predicts the relationship between particle scale anisotropies, the stress tensor components, and the bulk friction coefficient, capturing even transient behaviors. As such, this method shows promise for application to other dense particulate systems where fabric anisotropy can provide a useful measure of bulk friction.</description>

      <title>The interplay between liquid-liquid and ferroelectric phase transitions in supercooled water</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distinctive characteristics of water, evident in its thermodynamic anomalies, have implications across disciplines from biology to geophysics. Considered a valid hypothesis to rationalize its unique properties, a liquid-liquid phase transition in water's supercooled regime has nowadays been observed in several molecular dynamics simulations and is being actively researched experimentally. Here, we highlight intriguing and far-reaching implications of water: the ferroelectric and liquid-liquid phase transitions can be designed as two facets of the same underlying phenomenon. Our results are based on the analysis of extensive molecular dynamics simulations and are explained in the context of a classical density functional theory in mean-field approximation valid for a polar liquid. The theory underpins the potential role of ferroelectricity in promoting the liquid-liquid phase transition. The existence of ferroelectric order in supercooled low-density liquid water is confirmed by the observation in molecular dynamics simulations of collective modes in polarization fluctuations dynamics, traceable to spontaneous breaking of continuous rotational symmetry. Our work opens the door to new experimental investigations of the static and dynamic behavior of water polarization.</description>

      <title>A Modified Landau-de Gennes Theory for Smectic Liquid Crystals: Phase Transitions and Structural Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We mathematically model Smectic-A (SmA) phases with a modified Landau-de Gennes (mLdG) model. The orientational order of the SmA phase is described by a tensor-order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$, and the positional order is described by a real scalar $u$, which models the deviation from the average density of liquid crystal molecules. Firstly, we prove the existence and regularity of global minimisers of the mLdG free energy in three-dimensional settings. Then, we analytically prove that the mLdG model can capture the Isotropic-Nematic-Smectic phase transition as a function of temperature, under some assumptions. Further, we explore stable smectic phases on a square domain, with edge length $\lambda$, and tangent boundary conditions. We use heuristic arguments to show that defects repel smectic layers and strong nematic ordering promotes layer formation. We use asymptotic arguments in the $\lambda\to 0$ and $\lambda\to\infty$ limits which reveal the correlation between the number and thickness of smectic layers, the amplitude of density fluctuations with the phenomenological parameters in the mLdG energy. For finite values of $\lambda$, we numerically recover BD-like and D-like stable smectic states observed in experiments. We also study the frustrated mLdG energy landscape and give numerical examples of transition pathways between distinct mLdG energy minimisers.</description>

      <title>Loading-dependent microscale measures control bulk properties in granular material: an experimental test of the Stress-Force-Fabric relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk behaviour of granular materials is tied to its mesoscale and particle-scale features: strength properties arise from the buildup of various anisotropic structures at the particle-scale induced by grain connectivity (fabric), force transmission, and frictional mobilization. More fundamentally, these anisotropic structures work collectively to define features like the bulk friction coefficient and the stress tensor at the macroscale and can be explained by the Stress-Force-Fabric (SFF) relationship stemming from the microscale. Although the SFF relation has been extensively verified by discrete numerical simulations, a laboratory realization has remained elusive due to the challenge of measuring both normal and frictional contact forces. In this study, we analyze experiments performed on a photoelastic granular system under four different loading conditions: uniaxial compression, isotropic compression, pure shear, and annular shear. During these experiments, we record particle locations, contacts, and normal and frictional forces vectors to measure the particle-scale response to progressing strain. We track microscale measures like the packing fraction, average coordination number and average normal force along with anisotropic distributions of contacts and forces. We match the particle-scale anisotropy to the bulk using the SFF relation, which is founded on two key principles, a Stress Rule to describe the stress tensor and a Sum Rule to describe the bulk friction coefficient; we find that the Sum and Stress Rules accurately describe bulk measurements. Additionally, we test the assumption that fabric and forces transmit load equally through our granular packings and show that this assumption is sufficient at large strain values, and can be applied to areas like rock mechanics, soft colloids, or cellular tissue where force information is inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Spreading of Low-viscosity Ink Filaments Driven by Bath Viscoelasticity in Embedded Printing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inks deposited in conventional direct ink writing need to be able to support their own weight and that of the upper layers with minimal deformation to preserve the structural integrity of the three-dimensional (3D) printed parts. This constraint limits the range of usable inks to high-viscosity materials. Embedded printing enables the use of much softer inks by depositing the materials in a bath of another fluid that provides external support, thus diversifying the types of 3D printable structures. The interactions between the ink and bath fluids, however, give rise to a unique type of defect: spreading of the dispensed ink behind the moving nozzle. By printing horizontal threads made of dyed water in baths of Carbopol suspensions, we demonstrate that the spreading can be attributed to the pressure field generated in the viscous bath by the relative motion of the nozzle. As the pressure gradient increases with the viscosity of the bath fluid while the viscosity of the ink resists the flow, a larger bath-to-ink viscosity ratio results in more spreading for low-concentration Carbopol baths. For high-concentration, yield-stress-fluid baths, we find that the steady-state viscosity alone cannot account for the spreading, as the elastic stress becomes comparable to the viscous stress and the bath fluid around the dispensed ink undergoes fluidization and resolidification. By parameterizing the transient rheology of the high-concentration Carbopol suspensions using a simple viscoelastic model, we suggest that the ink spreading is exacerbated by the elasticity but is mitigated by the yield stress as long as the yield stress is low enough to allow steady injection of the ink. These results help illuminate the link between the bath rheology and the printing quality in embedded 3D printing.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have established negative energetic elasticity, the negative contribution of energy to the elastic modulus, as a universal property of polymer gels. To reveal the microscopic origin of this phenomenon, Shirai and Sakumichi investigated a polymer model on a cubic lattice with the energy effect from the solvent in finite-size calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023)]. Motivated by this work, we provide a simple platform to study the elasticity of polymer chains by considering a one-dimensional random walk with the energy effect. This model can be mapped onto the classical Ising chain, leading to an exact form of the free energy in the thermodynamic or continuous limit. Our analytical results are qualitatively consistent with Shirai and Sakumichi's work. Our model serves as a fundamental benchmark for studying negative energetic elasticity.</description>
