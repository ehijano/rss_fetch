      <title>A general Bayesian model-validation framework based on null-test evidence ratios, with an example application to global 21-cm cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing composite models for multi-component observational data is a prevalent scientific challenge. When fitting composite models, there exists the potential for systematics from a poor fit of one model component to be absorbed by another, resulting in the composite model providing an accurate fit to the data in aggregate but yielding biased a posteriori estimates for individual components. We begin by defining a classification scheme for composite model comparison scenarios, identifying two categories: category I, where models with accurate and predictive components are separable through Bayesian comparison of the unvalidated composite models, and category II, where models with accurate and predictive components may not be separable due to interactions between components, leading to spurious detections or biased signal estimation. To address the limitations of category II model comparisons, we introduce the Bayesian Null Test Evidence Ratio-based (BaNTER) validation framework. Applying this classification scheme and BaNTER to a composite model comparison problem in 21-cm cosmology, where minor systematics from imperfect foreground modelling can bias global 21-cm signal recovery, we validate six composite models using mock data. We show that incorporating BaNTER alongside Bayes-factor-based comparison reliably ensures unbiased inferences of the signal of interest across both categories, positioning BaNTER as a valuable addition to Bayesian inference workflows with potential applications across diverse fields.</description>

      <title>New accelerating cosmology without dark energy: The particle creation approach and the reduced relativistic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard procedure to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe is to assume the existence of an exotic component with negative pressure, generically called dark energy. Here, we propose a new accelerating flat cosmology without dark energy, driven by the negative creation pressure of a reduced relativistic gas (RRG). When the hybrid dark matter of the RRG is identified with cold dark matter, it describes the so-called CCDM cosmology whose dynamics is equivalent to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at both the background and perturbative levels (linear and nonlinear). This effect is quantified by the creation parameter $\alpha$. However, when the pressure from the RRG slightly changes the dynamics of the universe, as measured by a parameter $b$, the model departs slightly from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Therefore, this two-parametric model ($\alpha, b$) describes a new scenario whose dynamics is different but close to the late-time scenarios predicted by CCDM and $\Lambda$CDM models. The free parameters of the RRG model with creation are constrained based on SNe Ia data (Pantheon+SH0ES) and also using $H(z)$ from cosmic clocks. In principle, this mild distinction in comparison with both CCDM or $\Lambda$CDM may help alleviate some cosmological problems plaguing the current standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Implementing a Robust Test of Galaxy Catalogue Completeness for Dark Siren Measurements of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the application of a robust test of galaxy catalogue completeness to the gwcosmo pipeline. The method implements a straightforward statistical test for determining the apparent magnitude completeness limit of a magnitude-redshift sample. This offers an improved, less conservative approach compared with how galaxy catalogue completeness is currently estimated in the gwcosmo gravitational wave cosmology pipeline for determining the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. The test also does not require prior knowledge of the luminosity function, and thus returns a more robust estimate of the limiting apparent magnitude for a magnitude-redshift sample of galaxies. For GWTC-1 results using $B_{J}$-band photometry of galaxies in the GLADE catalogue, we find a $3.4\%$ improvement on the inference of $H_{0}$ using dark sirens only and a $1.3\%$ improvement for the combined posterior with GW170817. Using GLADE+, there is a $8.6\%$ improvement with dark sirens only and a $6.3\%$ improvement for the combined posterior with GW170817. However, the final posterior on $H_{0}$ using the GWTC-3 dataset with the GLADE+ $K$-band shows no improvement when applying the robust method. This is because the GLADE+ galaxy catalogue provides little or no coverage in the $K$-band for any of the GWTC-3 events. With the use of deeper galaxy catalogues in future gravitational wave cosmology analyses, the adoption of a less conservative estimate of magnitude completeness will become increasingly important.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from the ultraslow-roll phase in the inflaton--curvaton mixed field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a promising candidate for dark matter, as they can form in the very early universe without invoking new particle physics. This work explores PBH formation within a curvaton scenario featuring an ultraslow-roll (USR) phase. An inflaton--curvaton mixed field model is presented, where the inflaton drives early inflation and then transits into the USR phase, amplifying the small-scale curvature perturbation. During inflation, the curvaton generates entropy perturbation, which later converts into curvature perturbation after the curvaton decays in the radiation-dominated era. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we compute the power spectrum of the total primordial curvature perturbation and analyze the relevant non-Gaussianity. Our results show that adding a curvaton field not only has a significant impact on primordial non-Gaussianity, but also introduces more complex inflationary dynamics, even saving the inflaton potentials that generate too low scalar spectral indices. Our model can produce PBHs with mass around $10^{-14}\,M_\odot$ that account for all dark matter, while remaining consistent with current observational constraints.</description>

      <title>A primordial origin to cosmic tensions: towards a joint solution to the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions with early dark energy and scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension between direct measurements of the expansion rate and the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model calibrated on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), is a strong motivation to explore alternative cosmological models. A popular class of such models includes an additional component of dark energy relevant in the early Universe, which solves the Hubble tension. These Early Dark Energy (EDE) models however typically worsen the $S_8$ tension between measurements of weak gravitational lensing and the $\Lambda$CDM expectation. Here, we show how combining EDE with scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianities (sPNG) can in principle solve both tensions at once. Such sPNG are related to non-trivial inflationary physics, and observationally affect the non-linear regime of structure formation while leaving the linear regime mostly untouched. Depending on the amplitude of the sPNG, such models can either yield back the $\Lambda$CDM expectation for the PS in the non-linear regime, and hence an $S_8$ parameter compatible with $\Lambda$CDM, or can even reconcile the value of $S_8$ from weak-lensing measurements with the CMB, while solving the Hubble tension in all cases. In such models, both tensions would then be entirely related to pre-CMB physics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-to-dS and dS-to-dS transitions: Implications for the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and cosmological implications of dark energy (DE), modeled as a scalar field with a hyperbolic tangent potential that induces a smooth shift in the effective cosmological constant (CC), encompassing transitions such as AdS-dS, 0-dS, and dS-dS, with the mirror AdS-dS as a particular case aligned with the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. In our construction, a phantom scalar field with a negative kinetic term drives a bottom-up transition from an AdS-like vacuum at high redshifts to a dS-like vacuum at low redshifts, thereby providing a physical underpinning for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. Despite the negative kinetic term, the step-like form of the potential prevents pathologies such as unbounded energy growth, Big Rip, and violations of the WEC. Our numerical integration of the equations of motion shows that the model is consistent with both CMB data and the SH0ES determination of $H_0$, thereby addressing the $H_0$ tension, with all key kinematical parameters-$H(z)$, $\dot{H}(z)$, and $q(z)$-evolving smoothly. The total energy density of the phantom and matter system remains positive at all times, and the effective EoS stays above -1, ensuring that the WEC is satisfied. While the phantom field's energy density and pressure remain finite throughout, its EoS exhibits a safe singularity as its energy density smoothly crosses zero. We perform analysis of the transition period, demonstrating that the evolution of the DE density from a negative CC-like regime to a positive one does not exactly mirror the behavior of the potential-e.g., it lasts longer-as it also involves the kinetic term. We also show that analogous quintessence models featuring dS-dS transitions predict an $H_0$ value lower than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby failing to address the $H_0$ tension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario.</description>

      <title>Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. II. 3D Analysis and Dependence on Projection and Selection Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of subhalos in the vicinity of dark matter halo pairs in the Illustris-TNG simulation. The satellites around halo pairs with separations $d_{\text{sep}} &gt; 0.5~h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$ exhibit a non-uniform distribution, which is a combined result of two distinct features: the ``bulging'' distribution, characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the ``lopsided'' distribution, which shows an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs that are more widely separated and involve less massive halos, while the lopsidedness strengthens as the halo mass increases. Both signals depend weakly on halo mass ratio, and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from host halos. These measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of halos is properly taken into account. Our results imply that the lopsidedness and bulging distribution may arise from two distinct origins: the former is caused simply by the overlap of two closely placed halos, while the latter is driven by the alignment of halos with large-scale filamentary structures. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis of satellite distribution in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the SDSS galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large pair separations, low halo masses, and large halo mass ratios.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum constraints on Primordial non-Gaussianities with the eBOSS DR16 quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, the parameter quantifying the amplitude of local Primordial Non-Gaussianities (PNG), from a combined analysis of the tree-level power spectrum and bispectrum of Data Release $16$ (DR16) of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) quasar sample. In our analysis, we use the power spectrum measured with the optimal redshift weights that maximize the local PNG information together with the bispectrum estimated with the standard Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock weights. In the modeling, we incorporate the global and radial integral constraint corrections both in the power spectrum and in the bispectrum, for which we observe that only the radial integral constraint correction has a significant impact. Our constraints read $-6 &lt; f_{\rm NL} &lt; 20$ at $68\%$ confidence level and improve by $\sim 16\%$ over the previous power spectrum analysis of the same dataset. We observe the same improvement over the power spectrum analysis when the quasar response to PNG is lower. In this case, we find $-23 &lt; f_{\rm NL} &lt; 14$ at $68\%$ confidence level. Our findings are consistent with the Fisher matrix expectations.</description>

      <title>Primordial full bispectra from the general bounce cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities are key quantities to test early universe scenarios. In this paper, we compute full bispectra of scalar and tensor perturbations generated during a contracting phase in a general bounce model. The general bounce model consists of two branches: one realizes scale-invariant scalar and tensor power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes become constant on superhorizon scales, as in de Sitter inflation, while the other realizes scale-invariant power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes grow on superhorizon scales, as in matter bounce cosmology. We study the auto- and cross-bispectra originating from the scale-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations in these two branches. We investigate the amplitudes and shapes of non-Gaussianities and find that the differences between the two branches manifest for equilateral and squeezed momentum triangle configurations. In particular, one of the branches in which the superhorizon perturbations are conserved reproduces the so-called Maldacena's consistency relation. By examining perturbativity conditions and considering current observational constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities, we also find a viable parameter space in which both theoretical and observational constraints are satisfied simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Fast Generation of Weak Lensing Maps in Modified Gravity with COLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of weak lensing observables are essential for understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and probing the nature of gravity. In this work, we present a lightcone implementation to generate maps of the weak lensing convergence field using the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method. The lightcone is constructed in spherical shells from the source to the observer following an onion representation of the Universe.
  We validate the COLA-generated convergence maps in General Relativity by comparing five statistics to those of maps obtained with the high-resolution $N$-body simulations presented in Takahashi $et\ al.$ (2017): the power spectrum, bispectrum, probability distribution function, peak counts and Minkowski functionals. The convergence power spectrum is accurate to within $5\%$ up to $\ell\sim500$ and to within $10\%$ up to $\ell\sim750$, confirming the accuracy of this method on both linear and non-linear scales. For the probability distribution function, peak counts and Minkowski functionals, we determine the map pixel resolution required for COLA to capture the statistical features of the $N$-body convergence maps.
  Our validation tests provide a baseline for the convergence map specifications at which we can trust COLA for each statistic considered. Using these map specifications, we extend our analyses to two representative theories of Modified Gravity, and demonstrate their imprints on the five convergence statistics considered. This work represents a step towards precise weak lensing predictions under both General Relativity and Modified Gravity with reduced computational cost, providing a robust framework to explore the nature of gravity using field-level inference.</description>

      <title>Modeling Galaxies in the Early Universe with Supernova Dust Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova may be the dominant channel by which dust grains accumulate in galaxies during the first Gyr of cosmic time as formation channels important for lower redshift galaxies, e.g., AGB stars and grain growth, may not have had sufficient time to take over. Supernovae (SNe) produce fewer small grains, leading to a flatter attenuation law. In this work, we fit observations of 138 spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;6 galaxies adopting standard spectral energy distribution modeling assumptions and compare standard attenuation law prescriptions to that of supernova-produced dust alone. Compared to SMC dust, SNe attenuation yields up to 0.5 mag higher $A_V$, and 0.4 dex larger stellar masses. SNe dust attenuation also finds better fits to the rest-frame UV photometry with lower $\chi^2_{\rm UV}$. This allows the observed UV luminosities taken from the models to be fainter by 0.2 dex on average. The systematically fainter rest-frame UV luminosities for fixed observed photometry could help resolve current tension between the ionizing photon production implied by JWST observations and the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction. Given these systematic effects and the physical constraint of cosmic time itself, pure supernova dust attenuation laws should be a standard consideration in fitting to the spectral energy distributions of z&gt;6 galaxies.</description>

      <title>PROTOCALC, A W-band polarized calibrator for CMB Telescopes: application to Simons Observatory and CLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current- and next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments will measure polarization anisotropies with unprecedented sensitivities. The need for high precision in these measurements underscores the importance of gaining a comprehensive understanding of instrument properties, with a particular emphasis on the study of the beam properties and, in particular, their polarization characteristics, and the measurement of the polarization angle. In this context, a major challenge lies in the scarcity of millimeter polarized astrophysical sources with sufficient brightness and calibration knowledge to meet the stringent accuracy requirements of future CMB missions. This led to the development of a drone-borne calibration source designed for frequency band centered on approximately 90 GHz band, matching a commonly used channel in ground based CMB measurements. The PROTOtype CALibrator for Cosmology, PROTOCALC, has undergone thorough in-lab testing, and its properties have been subsequently modeled through simulation software integrated into the standard Simons Observatory (SO) analysis pipeline. Moreover, the PROTOCALC system has been tested in the field, having been deployed twice on calibration campaigns with CMB telescopes in the Atacama desert. The data collected constrain the roll angle of the source with a statistical accuracy of $0.045^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory reproducing the MOND phenomenology based on a non-Abelian Yang-Mills graviphoton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant (a "graviphoton") emerging in a regime of weak acceleration, i.e. below the MOND acceleration scale. Using the formalism of the effective field theory and invoking a mechanism of gravitational polarization of the dark matter medium, we show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a fundamental violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime. We show how to restore the general covariance of the model by adding one gravitational degree of freedom in the form of the scalar Khronon field.</description>

      <title>Key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We confirm the previous finding in the literature that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at a similar significance level ($3.2\sigma$) when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. The computationally efficient $\theta_\star$ and $\Omega_bh^2$ priors allow us to take a frequentist approach by comparing DES5YR SNe and DESI BAO with a large number ($\gtrsim 10^4$) of Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We find that $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy is very rare (occurrence rate = $0.28\%$) in simulations. When we combine DESI BAO with SN simulations or combine DES5YR SNe with BAO simulations, the occurrence rate of $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy increases to $1.2\%$ and $4.8\%$, respectively. These results indicate an internal inconsistency, i.e., a significant tension between DESI BAO + DES5YR SNe and Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models in both Bayesian and frequentist points of view. Although both DESI BAO and DES5YR SNe contribute to the preference for dynamic dark energy, the contribution from DES5YR SNe is more significant. In the frequentist point of view, even DES5YR SNe alone is in tension with Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models, though in Bayesian point of view this tension is prior dependent and inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physics with the Lyman-alpha forest: constraints on the growth of structure and neutrino masses from SDSS with effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory (EFT) approach to extract fundamental cosmological parameters from the Lyman-alpha forest flux fluctuations as an alternative to the standard simulation-based techniques. As a first application, we re-analyze the publicly available one-dimensional Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our analysis relies on informative priors on EFT parameters which we extract from a combination of public hydrodynamic simulation and emulator data. Assuming the concordance cosmological model, our one-parameter analysis yields a $2\%$ measurement of the late time mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.841\pm 0.017$, or equivalently, the structure growth parameter $S_8 = 0.852\pm 0.017$, consistent with the standard cosmology. This result is obtained assuming that non-linear EFT parameters are cosmology-independent functions of the linear bias parameter. When this assumption is loosened, the limit degrades by a factor of 3, suggesting that informative priors are necessary for competitive constraints. Combining our EFT likelihood with Planck + baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find a new constraint on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;$ 0.08 eV (at 95\% CL). Our study defines priorities for the development of EFT methods and sets the benchmark for cosmological analyses of the Lyman-alpha forest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>On the mass distribution of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merging black hole binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories, may help us shed light on how such binaries form. In addition, these detections can help us probe the hypothesized primordial black holes, a candidate for the observed abundance of dark matter. In this work, we study the black-hole mass distribution obtained from the LVK binary black hole merger events. We obtain that distribution by first associating a skewed normal distribution to each event detected with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$ 8 and then summing all such distributions. We also simulate black hole binaries from two separate populations of merging binaries. One of these is a stellar-origin population that follows a mass-distribution similar to the zero-age mass function of stars. The second population of black holes follows a Gaussian mass-distribution. Such a distribution could approximate a population of black hole binaries formed from earlier black hole mergers in dense stellar environments, or binaries of primordial black holes. For those populations, we evaluate the number of detectable events and fit their combination to the LVK observations. In our work, we rely on a wide range of stellar-origin black-hole mass distributions. We find that the observed LVK events can be fitted much better by the combination of such a stellar-origin mass distribution and a Gaussian distribution, than by the stellar-origin mass distribution alone.</description>

      <title>Constant roll and non-Gaussian tail in light of logarithmic duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The curvature perturbation in a model of constant-roll (CR) inflation is interpreted in view of the logarithmic duality discovered in Ref. [1] according to the $\delta N$ formalism. We confirm that the critical value $\beta:=\ddot{\varphi}/(H\dot{\varphi})=-3/2$ determining whether the CR condition is stable or not is understood as the point at which the dual solutions, i.e., the attractor and non-attractor solutions of the field equation, are interchanged. For the attractor-solution domination, the curvature perturbation in the CR model is given by a simple logarithmic mapping of a Gaussian random field, which can realise both the exponential tail (i.e., the single exponential decay) and the Gumbel-distribution-like tail (i.e., the double exponential decay) of the probability density function, depending on the value of $\beta$. Such a tail behaviour is important for, e.g., the estimation of the primordial black hole abundance.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of SNIa and BAO cosmic probes results using a two-regions model of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article revisits the interpretation of cosmic probes such as SNIa and BAO under a two-regions model of the universe. Standard cosmological analyses assume homogeneity, yet observations are predominantly conducted in overdense regions where matter is clustered, potentially biasing conclusions about cosmic expansion. We refine an existing two-regions framework that accounts for both overdense and underdense areas, demonstrating that the apparent acceleration of the universe, typically attributed to dark energy, can emerge as a consequence of observational bias rather than a fundamental cosmological constant. By applying this model to SNIa and BAO measurements, we show that inhomogeneities can affect redshift and distance estimates in a way that mimics cosmic acceleration. This interpretation provides a natural resolution to the coincidence problem and offers an alternative explanation for the observed tensions in Hubble constant measurements. Additionally, it may shed light on the unexpectedly early formation of galaxies observed by JWST. These findings challenge the necessity of dark energy and suggest that the observed acceleration may be an artefact of the spatial distribution of matter rather than a true universal phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Spectra of magnetic fields from electroweak symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize magnetic fields produced during electroweak symmetry breaking by non-dynamical numerical simulations based on the Kibble mechanism. The generated magnetic fields were thought to have an energy spectrum $\propto k^3$ for small wavenumbers $k$, but here we show that it is actually a spectrum $\propto k^4$ along with characteristic fluctuations in the magnetic helicity. Using scaling results from MHD simulations for the evolution and assuming that the initial magnetic field is coherent on the electroweak Hubble scale, we estimate the magnetic field strength to be $\sim 10^{-13}\, \rmG$ on kpc scales at the present epoch for non-helical fields. For maximally helical fields we obtain $\sim 10^{-10}\, \rmG$ on Mpc scales. We also give scalings of these estimates for partially helical fields.</description>

      <title>The DESI 2024 hint for dynamical dark energy is biased by low-redshift supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a $\sim3.9\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration inspired hot debates on new physics or systematics. In this letter, we reveal this significant preference is dominated by an external low-redshift supernova (low-$z$ SN) sample that combines with the Dark Energy Survey SN program (DES-SN) in their Year 5 data release (DESY5). Further implementing the $a_B$ (the intercept of the SN magnitude-redshift relation) diagnosis between low-$z$ and DES-SN samples, we find large dispersions in the low-$z$ SN sample with a $\sim0.043$ magnitude discrepancy in $-5a_B$ from the high-$z$ DES-SN sample, suggesting potential systematics in DESY5. Correcting for this low-$z$ systematics or directly ignoring the low-$z$ sample can largely reduce the preference for dynamical DE to be $&lt;2\sigma$ or even $&lt;1\sigma$ if further eliminating the data interference from the cosmic microwave background. Therefore, the DESI preference for dynamical DE might be a mirage of unknown systematics in low-$z$ SNe with a mismatch intercept.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Bianchi I spacetimes within the Jordan frame of Brans-Dicke theory, incorporating the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. After developing general formulas, we analyze the robustness of classical singularity resolution due to quantum geometric effects using two common quantization schemes. We then compare the resulting physical properties. We find that both schemes replace classical singularities with regular quantum bounces. Notably, in contrast to similar studies based on general relativity, we find that all three directional scale factors of the Bianchi I spacetimes increase and after the quantum bounce they reach values similar to their initial values, leading to a merging with classical spacetimes in both schemes.</description>

      <title>Disentangling gamma-beta: the 4th-order velocity moments based on spherical Jeans analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distinguishing a core and a cusp within dark matter halos is complexified by the existence of mass-anisotropy degeneracy, where various combinations of velocity anisotropy ($\beta$) and inner density slope ($\gamma$) yield similar observational signatures. We construct a dynamical model that incorporates the 4th-order velocity moments to alleviate this challenge. The inclusion of the 4th-order velocity moments enables stars' line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) to be flexible. This flexible LOSVD can cover from a thin-tailed to a heavy-tailed distribution that is inaccessible if only the 2nd-order moments are considered. We test the model on four mock galaxies having isotropic orbits, $\beta = 0$: two resembling dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and two resembling ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) in terms of velocity dispersion. Each category includes one galaxy with a cuspy NFW profile and one with a cored density profile. Results show that a ratio of the global velocity dispersion to velocity error, $\sigma_{\rm los,global} / \delta v_{\rm los} \gtrsim 4$, is crucial to avoid systematic biases arising from the strong sensitivity of 4th-order moments to the LOSVD tails. In cases where this velocity ratio condition is met, our model reliably recovers $\gamma$ in dSph mock galaxies, with the true value recovered within $\sim 1\sigma$, and strongly excludes a cuspy NFW profile for the cored dSph mock galaxy. However, recovering the density profiles of UFDs remains challenging due to their intrinsically low velocity dispersions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution to standard model cosmological perturbation theory in a matter-dominated, adiabatic, hydrodynamic era. The solution is in the form of hypergeometric functions. While such functions can oscillate with the sound velocity, they can only do so at high frequency. There is thus a maximum wavelength to these oscillations, with this maximum wavelength serving to provide a horizon for acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Constraining inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array third data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an inflation model with nonminimal derivative coupling that features a coupling between the derivative of the inflaton field and the Einstein tensor. This model naturally amplifies curvature perturbations at small scales via gravitationally enhanced friction, a mechanism critical for the formation of primordial black holes and the associated production of potentially detectable scalar-induced gravitational waves. We derive analytical expressions for the primordial power spectrum, enabling efficient exploration of the model parameter space without requiring computationally intensive numerical solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation. Using the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA DR3), we constrain the model parameters characterizing the coupling function: $\phi_c = 3.7^{+0.3}_{-0.5} M_\mathrm{P}$, $\log_{10} \omega_L = 7.1^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$, and $\log_{10} \sigma = -8.3^{+0.3}_{-0.6}$ at 90\% confidence level. Our results demonstrate the growing capability of pulsar timing arrays to probe early Universe physics, complementing traditional cosmic microwave background observations by providing unique constraints on inflationary dynamics at small scales.</description>
