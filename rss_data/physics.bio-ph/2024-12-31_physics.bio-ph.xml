      <title>Biological Insights from Integrative Modeling of Intrinsically Disordered Protein Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions are increasingly appreciated for their abundance in the proteome and the many functional roles they play in the cell. In this short review, we describe a variety of approaches used to obtain biological insight from the structural ensembles of disordered proteins, regions, and complexes and the integrative biology challenges that arise from combining diverse experiments and computational models. Importantly, we highlight findings regarding structural and dynamic characterization of disordered regions involved in binding and phase separation, as well as drug targeting of disordered regions, using a broad framework of integrative modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Electro-Optic Modulator source as sample-free calibrator and frequency stabilizer for Brillouin Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin Microscopy is a novel label-free optical technique that enables the measurement of a material's mechanical properties at the sub-micron scale in a non-invasive and non-contact way; in the last few years, its applications in the life sciences have extensively expanded. However, many Brillouin Microscopes suffer from temporal instabilities that impact their performances, showing drifts in the acquired spectra during time that may lead to inconsistencies between data acquired at different days. The current method to solve this problem is to frequently (i.e. every 30 minutes) re-align the spectrometer and to perform repeated calibrations with standard materials. Here, we show a method to remove temporal instabilities of a Brillouin Microscope by inserting an Electro-Optic Modulator (EOM) that can be used: i) as a reference frequency during data measurements; ii) as a calibrator, allowing the reconstruction of the pixel-to-GHz dispersion curve with high precision, in an automatic pipeline and without the need for reference samples; iii) as a way to check the frequency shift of the system and compensate for drifts. We here show that our Brillouin Microscope, equipped with an EOM and a tuneable laser, was able to automatically acquire data for more than 2 days without the need to realign the spectrometer; retrieved Brillouin shifts and widths showed superior stability than standard Brillouin Microscopes. These results pave the way for a prototype of an automatic Brillouin Microscope that, once aligned, can automatically acquire data for hours or days.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Information Exchange in Zebrafish: The Role of U-Turns in Visual Communication and Behavior Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motions of visually coupled zebrafish pairs are studied to understand the effects of information exchange on their behavior as a function of their minimal separation ($d$). We find that when $d$ is small, the pair can display a leader-follower relation (LFR) with trajectories of almost synchronized form. However, with larger $d$, although the same LFR is still maintained, the originally similar trajectories turn into different forms. Detailed analysis of their motion trajectories suggests that the pair might be using U-turns (UTs) to exchange information and to maintain a LFR at the same time. A simulation model based on UTs with inferred and proposed rules is able to reproduce prominent features of observed trajectories; indicating that the transition of trajectories can be understood as the result of a change in information exchange between the fish as $d$ increases. Our finding that UTs as important visual signals is consistent with the fact that UTs can induce a large amount of firings in retinas of observing fish.</description>

      <title>Photonics detection of molecular-specific spatial structural alterations in cell nuclei due to chronic alcoholism and probiotics treatments on colon cancer via a light localization method using confocal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonics/light localization techniques are important in understanding the structural changes in biological tissues at the nano- to sub-micron scale. It is now known that structural alteration starts at the nanoscale at the beginning of cancer progression. This study examines the molecular-specific nano-structural alterations of chronic alcoholism and probiotic effects on colon cancer using a mouse model of colon cancer. Confocal microscopy and mesoscopic light-scattering analysis are applied to quantify structural changes in DNA (chromatin), cytoskeleton, and ki-67 protein cells with appropriate staining dyes. We assessed alcohol-treated and azoxymethane (AOM) with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis models, including ethanol (EtOH) and probiotic (L.Casei) treatments separately and together. The inverse participation ratio (IPR) technique was employed to quantify the degree of light localization to access the molecular-specific spatial structural disorder as a biomarker for cancer progression detection. Significant enhancement of cancer progression was observed in the alcohol-treated group, and probiotics treatment with alcohol showed partial reversal of these changes in colon cancer. The results underscore the potential of the IPR technique in detecting early structural changes in colon cancer, offering insights into the mitigating effects of probiotics on alcohol-induced enhancement of colon cancer.</description>

      <title>Kinetically arrested clusters in active filament arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Brownian dynamics simulations and theory to study the over-damped spatiotemporal dynamics and pattern formation in a fluid-permeated array of equally spaced, active, elastic filaments that are pinned at one end and free at the other. The filaments are modeled as connected colloidal chains with activity incorporated via compressive follower forces acting along the filament backbone. The length of the chains is smaller than the thermal persistence length. For a range of filament separation and activity values, we find that the filament array eventually self-assembles into a series of regularly spaced, kinetically arrested, compact clusters. Filament activity, geometry, elasticity, and grafting density are each seen to crucially influence the size, shape, and spacing of emergent clusters. Furthermore, cluster shapes for different grafting densities can be rescaled into self-similar forms with activity-dependent scaling exponents. We derive theoretical expressions that relate the number of filaments in a cluster and the spacing between clusters, to filament activity, filament elasticity, and grafting density. Our results provide insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the initiation of clustering and suggest that steric contact forces and friction balance active forces and filament elasticity to stabilize the clusters. Our simulations suggest design principles to realize filament-based clusters and similar self-assembling biomimetic materials using active colloids or synthetic microtubule-motor systems.</description>

      <title>Collective epithelial migration mediated by the unbinding of hexatic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective cell migration in epithelia relies on cell intercalation: a local remodelling of the cellular network that allows neighbouring cells to swap their positions. Unlike foams and passive cellular fluid, in epithelial intercalation these rearrangements crucially depend on activity. During these processes, the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein conspire to produce a burst of remodelling events, which collectively give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered) structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in vitro epithelial layers.</description>

      <title>Using multiple Dirac delta points to describe inhomogeneous flux density over a cell boundary in a single-cell diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological cells can release compounds into their direct environment, generally inhomogeneously over their cell membrane, after which the compounds spread by diffusion. In mathematical modelling and simulation of a collective of such cells, it is theoretically and numerically advantageous to replace spatial extended cells with point sources, in particular when cell numbers are large, but still so small that a continuum density description cannot be justified, or when cells are moving. We show that inhomogeneous flux density over the cell boundary may be realized in a point source approach, thus maintaining computational efficiency, by utilizing multiple, clustered point sources (and sinks). In this report, we limit ourselves to a sinusoidal function as flux density in the spatial exclusion model, and we show how to determine the amplitudes of the Dirac delta points in the point source model, such that the deviation between the point source model and the spatial exclusion model is small.</description>

      <title>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. We also demonstrate that this effective asymmetry generated by the rapid yawing can cause chaotic behaviour in the emergent dynamics, in stark contrast to the emergent dynamics generated by rapidly rotating spheroids, which are equivalent to those of effective passive spheroids. In general, we find that the shape of the equivalent effective particle under rapid yawing is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. In these scenarios, we calculate analytically the equivalent aspect ratio of the effective spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</description>
