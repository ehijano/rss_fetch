      <title>Observation of Rashba Magnetism in Ultrathin Ferromagnet-Heavy Metal Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in systems with broken inversion symmetry lift the spin degeneracy of electronic bands, but the consequences of interplay between these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that ultrathin transition ferromagnet-heavy metal bilayers exhibit anomalous temperature- and electric bias-dependent behaviors in the vicinity of the Curie temperature, inconsistent with the usual Weiss magnetism. Characterization by several complementary techniques and analysis of the dependence on composition reveal that these effects originate from interfacial spin-orbit interaction, which results in the emergence of a state with distinct magnetic and magnetoelectronic properties that can be described as Rashba magnetism. Our findings open a new route for the characterization and control of spin-orbit phenomena in heterostructures enabling the development of efficient spin-orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Preserving Surface Strain in Nanocatalysts via Morphology Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering strain critically affects the properties of materials and has extensive applications in semiconductors and quantum systems. However, the deployment of strain-engineered nanocatalysts faces challenges, particularly in maintaining highly strained nanocrystals under reaction conditions. Here, we introduce a morphology-dependent effect that stabilizes surface strain even under harsh reaction conditions. Employing four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), we discovered that core-shell Au@Pd nanoparticles with sharp-edged morphologies sustain coherent heteroepitaxial interfaces with designated surface strain. This configuration inhibits dislocation due to reduced shear stress at corners, as molecular dynamics simulations indicate. Demonstrated in a Suzuki-type cross-coupling reaction, our approach achieves a fourfold increase in activity over conventional nanocatalysts, owing to the enhanced stability of surface strain. These findings contribute to advancing the development of advanced nanocatalysts and indicate broader applications for strain engineering in various fields.</description>

      <title>Phase engineering of giant second harmonic generation in Bi$_2$O$_2$Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with remarkable second-harmonic generation (SHG) hold promise for future on-chip nonlinear optics. Relevant materials with both giant SHG response and environmental stability are long-sought targets. Here, we demonstrate the enormous SHG from the phase engineering of a high-performance semiconductor, Bi$_2$O$_2$Se (BOS), under uniaxial strain. SHG signals captured in strained 20 nm-BOS films exceed those of NbOI$_2$ and NbOCl$_2$ of similar thickness by a factor of 10, and are four orders of magnitude higher than monolayer-MoS$_2$, resulting in a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility on the order of 1 nm V$^{-1}$. Intriguingly, the strain enables continuous adjustment of the ferroelectric phase transition across room temperature. Consequently, an exceptionally large tunability of SHG, approximately six orders of magnitude, is achieved through strain or thermal modulation. This colossal SHG, originating from the geometric phase of Bloch wave functions and coupled with sensitive tunability through multiple approaches in this air-stable 2D semiconductor, opens new possibilities for designing chip-scale, switchable nonlinear optical devices.</description>

      <title>Elastic plate basis for the deformation and electron diffraction of twisted bilayer graphene on a substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A basis is derived from elastic plate theory that quantifies equilibrium and dynamic deformation and electron diffraction patterns of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). The basis is derived by solving in-plane and out-of-plane normal modes of an unforced parallelogram elastic plate. We show that a combination of only a few basis terms successfully captures the relaxed TBG structure with and without an underlying substrate computed using atomistic simulations. The results are validated by comparison with electron diffraction experiments. A code for extracting the elastic plate basis coefficients from an experimental electron diffraction image accompanies this paper. TBG dynamics are also studied by computing the phonon band structure from atomistic simulations. Low-energy phonons at the $\Gamma$ point are examined in terms of the mode shape and frequency. These modes are captured by simple elastic plate models with uniformly distributed springs for inter-layer and substrate interactions.</description>

      <title>Large Nernst Effect in a layered metallic antiferromagnet EuAl$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large Nernst effect is advantageous for developing transverse Nernst thermoelectric generators or Ettingshausen coolers within a single component, avoiding the complexity of electron- and hole-modules in longitudinal Seebeck thermoelectric devices. We report a large Nernst signal reaching 130 uV/K at 8 K and 13 T in the layered metallic antiferromagnet EuAl$_2$Si$_2$. Notably, this large transverse Nernst thermopower is two orders of magnitude greater than its longitudinal counterpart. The Nernst coefficient peaks around 4 K and 8 K at 3 T and 13 T, respectively. At similar temperatures, both the Hall coefficient and the Seebeck signal change sign. Additionally, nearly compensated electron- and hole-like carriers with high mobility ($\sim$ 4000 cm$^2$/Vs at 4 K) are revealed from the magnetoconductivity. These findings suggest that the large Nernst effect and vanishing Seebeck thermopower in EuAl$_2$Si$_2$ are due to the compensated electron- and hole-like bands, along with the high mobility of the Weyl band near the Fermi level. Our results underscore the importance of band compensation and topological fermiology in achieving large Nernst thermopower and exploring potential Nernst thermoelectric applications at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>SiO$_2$-mediated facile hydrothermal synthesis of spiroffite-type Co$_2$Te$_3$O$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrothermal synthesis of novel materials typically relies on both knowledge of the redox activities of all cations present in the reaction solution and a small toolset of so-called mineralizers to tune the solution's overall chemical potential. Upon the use of a less conventional mineralizer species, SiO$_2$, we show the stabilization of spiroffite-type Co$_2$Te$_3$O$_8$ under less forceful hydrothermal conditions than in previous reports. When synthesized in the presence of both SiO$_2$ and each respective alkali carbonate as a secondary mineralizer, silicon substitution in place of tellurium in the host structure becomes apparent, and the corresponding introduced disorder gives rise to enhanced low-temperature ferromagnetism. Our results highlight the complexities of underutilized and combined mineralizer species in the stabilization and tuning of complex magnetic ground states via hydrothermal synthesis techniques.</description>

      <title>Lattice distortion leads to glassy thermal transport in crystalline Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The glassy thermal conductivities observed in crystalline inorganic perovskites such as Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ is perplexing and lacking theoretical explanations. Here, we first experimentally measure such its thermal transport behavior from 20~K to 300~K, after synthesizing Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ single crystals. Using path-integral molecular dynamics simulations driven by machine learning potentials, we reveal that Cs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ has large lattice distortions at low temperatures, which may be related to the large atomic size mismatch. Employing the regularized Wigner thermal transport theory, we reproduce the experimental thermal conductivities based on lattice-distorted structures. This study thus provides a framework for predicting and understanding glassy thermal transport in materials with strong lattice disorder.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of the physical properties of wide band gap hexagonal AlPO4 compound for possible applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, using the density functional theory, we have investigated the bulk physical properties like structural, electronic band structure, elastic properties, thermal properties, optical properties and bonding features of AlPO4 compound in the hexagonal form. The values of our optimized structural parameters are very close to the previous results. Most of the results presented in this work are novel. The elastic constants indicate that AlPO4 is mechanically stable and brittle in nature. The compound is moderately hard and possesses low machinability index. AlPO4 contains significant elastic anisotropy. The charge density distribution , bond population analysis, Vickers hardness, thermo-mechanical properties, and optical properties have been investigated for the first time. The electronic band structure calculations reveal clear insulating behavior with a band gap of 6.0 eV. Band structure calculations were carried out without and with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to explore possible topological signature. The energy dependent optical properties conform to the electronic band structure calculations. Major optical properties like dielectric functions, refractive index, photoconductivity, absorption coefficient, loss function and reflectivity are calculated and discussed in detail in this study. The compound is optically anisotropic. It is an efficient absorber and reflector of the ultraviolet light.</description>

      <title>Disentangling thermal birefringence and strain in the all-optical switching of ferroelectric polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated that the optical excitation of crystalline materials with intense narrow-band infrared pulses, tailored to match the frequencies at which the crystal's permittivity approaches close to zero, can drive a permanent reversal of magnetic and ferroelectric ordering. However, the physical mechanism that microscopically underpins this effect remains unclear, as well as the precise role of laser-induced heating and macroscopic strains. Here, we explore how infrared pulses can simultaneously give rise to strong temperature-dependent birefringence and strain in ferroelectric barium titanate. We develop a model of these two coexisting effects, allowing us to use polarization microscopy to disentangle them through their spatial distributions, temporal evolutions and spectral dependencies. We experimentally observe strain-induced patterns that are an order of magnitude larger than that which can be accounted for by laser-induced heating alone, suggesting that non-thermal effects must also play a role. Our results reveal the distinct fingerprints of heat- and strain-induced birefringence, shedding new light on the process of all-optical switching of order parameters in the epsilon-near-zero regime.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Raman modes in twisted bilayer TMDCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer two-dimensional transition-metal dichalgocenides (TMDCs) exhibit a range of novel phenomena such as the formation of moir\'e excitons and strongly correlated phases. The coupling between the layers is crucial for the resulting physical properties and depends not just on the twist angle but also on the details of the fabrication process. Here, we present an approach for the analysis of this interlayer coupling via Raman spectroscopy. By exciting the C-exciton resonance of the TMDCs, optical (high-frequency) interlayer Raman modes are activated that are too weak in intensity at excitation energies far below the C exciton. This is due to the wave function of the C exciton, which expands - in contrast to A and B excitons - over both layers and, therefore, couples the layers electronically. We present optical interlayer Raman modes in twisted 2L TMDCs and show that they can be used as a measure of the interlayer coupling between the individual layers.</description>

      <title>Using Light to Polarize and Detect Electron Spins in Silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, demonstration of all-optical detection and control of free electron spins in silicon remains elusive. Here, we directly probe the electron spin properties in bulk silicon by measuring the polarization of luminescence following circularly polarized light excitation. The experiments performed for both direct and indirect gap excitation allow not only an experimental determination of the optical selection rules in silicon for the different phononassisted transitions but they also lead to the measurement of the spin relaxation of electrons in conditions which are not accessible using transport techniques. We also measure the spin properties of free excitons in bulk silicon, a very little explored field.</description>

      <title>Electron Mobilities in SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$: Role of Phonon Anharmonicity, Mass Renormalization and Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting carrier mobility in strongly anharmonic solids necessitates a precise characterization of lattice dyndamics as a function of temperature. We achieve consistency with experimental electron mobility data for bulk KTaO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ above 150 K by refining the Boltzmann transport equations. This refinement includes incorporating temperature-dependent anharmonic phonon eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes into the electron-phonon interaction tensor, while maintaining the derivatives of the Kohn-Sham potential as computed in density functional perturbation theory. Using efficient machine-learned force fields and the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, we accurately compute the dynamical matrices. At room temperature, the calculated mobility for SrTiO$_3$ exceeds experimental values by an order of magnitude, whereas the overestimation for KTaO$_3$ is way less pronounced. This discrepancy is explained through the more significant electron mass renormalization near the conduction band bottom due to anharmonic electron-phonon coupling and the presence of local disorder in SrTiO$_3$.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and manipulating the relationship between intentionally introduced disorder and material properties necessitates efficient characterization techniques. For example, single crystal diffuse scattering experiments provide insights into the driving forces behind local order phenomena. In this work, we present a time- and resource-efficient approach based on mean field theory, that quantifies local interaction energies but unlike other techniques does not require computationally expensive supercell models. The method is employed to quantify competing interactions in functionally disordered materials such as disordered rock salt cathode materials and Prussian blue analogs that share an underlying face-centred lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a first-principles method to calculate the electron-phonon coupling for specific modes and &lt;b&gt;q&lt;/b&gt;-points in the Brillouin Zone for crystalline organic semiconductors. Using the obtained coupling strengths, we propose an approach to compute the temperature-dependent mobilities of electrons and holes. This methodology is applied to both bulk and thin-film polymorphs of tetracene. To validate our treatment of the electronic structures and vibrational properties, we calculate the Raman spectra in the lattice-phonon region and compare them with experimental data. We then compare the computed mobilities with available data for single crystals, finding good agreement within the experimental range, especially when accounting for possible charged impurities. Finally, we discuss the observed differences between the polymorphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clays are a broad class of ubiquitous layered materials. Their specific chemophysical properties are intimately connected to their molecular structure, featuring repeating patterns broken by substitutions. Molecular dynamics simulations can provide insight into the mechanisms leading to the emergent properties of these layered materials, however up to now idealised clay structures have been simulated to make the modelling process tractable. We present ClayCode, software facilitating the modelling of clay systems closely resembling experimentally determined structures. By comparing a realistic model to a commonly used montmorillonite clay model, we demonstrate that idealised models feature noticeably different ionic adsorption patterns. We then present an application of ClayCode to the study the competitive barium and sodium adsorption on Wyoming montmorillonite, Georgia kaolinite, and Montana illite, of interest in the context of nuclear waste disposal.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Timescales of Spin Reorientation in $TbMn_{6}Sn_{6}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $TbMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ is a ferrimagnetic material which exhibits a highly unusual phase transition near room temperature where spins remain collinear while the total magnetic moment rotates from out-of-plane to in-plane. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have been studied in the quasi-static limit and the reorientation has been attributed to the competing anisotropies of Tb and Mn, whose magnetic moments have very different temperature dependencies. In this work, we present the first measurement of the spin-reorientation transition in $TbMn_{6}Sn_{6}$. By probing very small signals with the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) at the Mn M-edge, we show that the re-orientation timescale spans from 12 ps to 24 ps, depending on the laser excitation fluence. We then verify these data with a simple model of spin precession with a temperature-dependent magnetocrystalline anisotropy field to show that the spin reorientation timescale is consistent with the reorientation being driven by very large anisotropies energies on approximately $\approx$ meV scales. Promisingly, the model predicts a possibility of 180o reorientation of the out-of-plane moment over a range of excitation fluences. This could facilitate optically controlled magnetization switching between very stable ground states, which could have useful applications in spintronics or data storage.</description>

      <title>Room temperature detection of the (H2)2 dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrogen dimer, (H2)2, is among the most weakly bound van der Waals complexes and a prototype species for first principles ab initio studies. The detection of the (H2)2 infrared absorption spectrum was reported more than thirty years ago at a temperature of 20 K. Due to the sharp decrease of the (H2)2 abundance with temperature, a detection at room temperature was generally considered as hardly achievable. Here we report the first room temperature detection of partly resolved rotational structures of (H2)2 by cavity ring down spectroscopy at sub-atmospheric pressures, in the region of the first overtone band of H2 near 1.2 micron. The quantitative analysis of the absorption features observed around ten allowed or forbidden transition frequencies of the monomer provides insight on the structure of this elusive species and a benchmark for future theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Diverging shift current responses in the gapless limit of two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shift current responses of two-dimensional systems in the gapless limit are investigated. As the energy gap becomes smaller, the interband transition probability becomes larger at the band edges. We found the divergence of the shift current response in a manner proportional to the inverse of the gap size when the system becomes a two-dimensional Weyl semimetal in the gapless limit. This behavior is different from that for electric polarization, which has a jump across the gapless case. It means that the quantitative relationship between electric polarizations and shift currents is broken in this gapless limit.</description>

      <title>Comparison of integral equation theories of the liquid state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ornstein-Zernike equation is a powerful tool in liquid state theory for predicting structural and thermodynamic properties of fluids. Combined with a suitable closure, it has been shown to reproduce e.g. the static structure factor, pressure, and compressibility of liquids to a great degree of accuracy. However, out of the multitude of closures that exist for the Ornstein-Zernike equation, it is hard to predict a priori which closure will give the most accurate predictions for the system at hand. To alleviate this problem, we compare the predictive power of many closures on a curated set of representative benchmark systems, including those with hard-sphere, inverse power-law, Gaussian core, and Lennard-Jones particles, in three and two dimensions. For example, we find that the well-known and highly used Percus-Yevick closure gives significantly worse predictions than lesser-known closures of equal complexity in all cases studied. We anticipate that the trends observed in our results will aid in making more informed decisions regarding closure choices. To facilitate the adoption of more modern closure theories, we also have packaged, documented, and distributed the code necessary to numerically solve the equations for a given closure and pair interaction potential.</description>

Abstract: Si and its oxides have been extensively explored in theoretical research due to their technological and industrial importance. Simultaneously describing interatomic interactions within both Si and SiO$_2$ without the use of \textit{ab initio} methods is considered challenging, given the charge transfers involved. Herein, this challenge is overcome by developing a unified machine learning interatomic potentials describing the Si/ SiO$_2$/ O system, based on the moment tensor potential (MTP) framework. This MTP is trained using a comprehensive database generated using density functional theory simulations, encompassing a wide range of crystal structures, point defects, extended defects, and disordered structure. Extensive testing of the MTP is performed, indicating it can describe static and dynamic features of very diverse Si, O, and SiO$_2$ atomic structures with a degree of fidelity approaching that of DFT</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in accelerated materials innovation in the context of the process-structure-property chain. In this regard, it is essential to take into account manufacturing processes and tailor materials design approaches to support downstream process design approaches. As a major step into this direction, we present a holistic optimization approach that covers the entire process-structure-property chain in materials engineering. Our approach specifically employs machine learning to address two critical identification problems: a materials design problem, which involves identifying near-optimal material structures that exhibit desired properties, and a process design problem that is to find an optimal processing path to manufacture these structures. Both identification problems are typically ill-posed, which presents a significant challenge for solution approaches. However, the non-unique nature of these problems offers an important advantage for processing: By having several target structures that perform similarly well, processes can be efficiently guided towards manufacturing the best reachable structure. The functionality of the approach will be demonstrated manufacturing crystallographic textures with desired properties in a metal forming process.</description>

Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under various external perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate real time TDDFT based electron dynamics simulations using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental parameters.</description>

Abstract: Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly promising candidates for a myriad of potential applications in room-temperature electronics; however, as it stands, establishing a clear connection between their spin-state switching and transport properties has been far from trivial. In this letter, an effort to unravel the underlying charge transport mechanism in these SCO complexes, via a general theory, is made. The theory presented herein is aimed at providing a unifying picture that explains the widely different trends observed in the spin-crossover-dependent carrier transport properties in the SCO molecular thin film systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling structural phases of Sn through lattice engineering</title>

Abstract: Topology and superconductivity, two distinct phenomena offer unique insight into quantum properties and their applications in quantum technologies, spintronics, and sustainable energy technologies if system can be found where they coexist. Tin (Sn) plays a pivotal role here as an element due to its two structural phases, $\alpha$-Sn and $\beta$-Sn, exhibiting topological characteristics ($\alpha$-Sn) and superconductivity ($\beta$-Sn). In this study we show how precise control of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases of Sn thin films can be achieved by using molecular beam epitaxy grown buffer layers with systematic control over the lattice parameter. The resulting Sn films showed either $\beta$-Sn or $\alpha$-Sn phases as the lattice constant of the buffer layer was varied from 6.10 A to 6.48 A, covering the range between GaSb (closely matched to InAs) and InSb. The crystal structures of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Sn films were characterized by x-ray diffraction and confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The smooth and continuous surface morphology of the Sn films was validated using atomic force microscopy. The characteristics of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Sn phases were further verified using electrical transport measurements by observing resistance drop near 3.7 K for superconductivity of the $\beta$-Sn phase and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations for the $\alpha$-Sn phase. Density functional theory calculations showed that the stability of the Sn phases is highly dependent on lattice strain, with $\alpha$-Sn being more stable under tensile strain and $\beta$-Sn becoming favorable under compressive strain, which is in good agreement with experimental observations. Hence, this study sheds light on controlling Sn phases through lattice engineering, enabling innovative applications in quantum technologies and beyond.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Transitions in La2CoTiO6: Antiferromagnetic Insulator to Nonmagnetic Metal via Antiferromagnetic Metal in a Double Perovskite Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In double perovskite oxides (A$_2$BB$^\prime$O$_6$), magnetism often arises from diluted magnetic lattices, created by combining a perovskite structure with localized 3$d$ magnetic elements (B) alongside another perovskite lattice containing nearly nonmagnetic delocalized 4$d$/$5d$ elements (B$^\prime$). Alternatively, the magnetic lattice can consist entirely of 3$d$ elements, with one being completely nonmagnetic with $d^0$ state. La$_2$CoTiO$_6$ (LCTO), a representative double perovskite oxide, contains Ti in a nonmagnetic state with a $d^0$ electron configuration due to its $4^+$ oxidation state. Experimental evidence shows that LCTO possesses a monoclinic structure (space group $P2_1/n$) and behaves as an antiferromagnet with a N\'{e}el temperature of 14.6 K. Through first-principle electronic structure calculations, we uncover that adjusting external hydrostatic pressure induces a sequence of phase transitions: from antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM-I) to antiferromagnetic metal (AFM-M), and ultimately to itinerant nonmagnetic metal (NM-M). The transition from AFM-I to AFM-M at $\sim$ 42 GPa pressure coincides with a shift in spin states, moving from a high-spin (HS) state to a low-spin (LS) state, while Co retains a $d^7$ configuration. Distortion within the monoclinic structure under pressure plays a pivotal role in the spin-state transition. At the AFM-I to AFM-M transition, we observe a sharp decrease in the ratio of the octahedral volumes occupied by Co and Ti. Such change in ratio is linked to variations in octahedral volumes, akin to a breathing mode distortion. We explore the impact of the breathing mode distortion by examining a highly symmetric theoretical structure (space-group $I4/mmm$), achieved by optimizing the structure with all $\angle${Co-O-Ti} angles set to 180$^{\circ}$.</description>

Abstract: A path integral method, combined with atomistic spin dynamics simulations, has been developed to calculate thermal quantum expectation values using a classical approach. In this study, we show how to treat Hamiltonians with non-linear terms, that are relevant for describing uniaxial anisotropies and mechanical constraints. These interactions can be expressed solely through quadratic terms of the spin operator along one axis, that can be identified with the quantisation axis.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at mirror and twistronic twin boundaries in van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral (3R) polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, 3R-MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarisation, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that assembling pairs of mono-twin films with a `magic' twist angle $\theta^*$ that provides commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, and we specify the values of $\theta^*$ for homo- and heterostructures of various TMDs.</description>

      <title>Discovering classical spin liquids by topological search of high symmetry nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin liquids are a paradigmatic example of a non-trivial state of matter, and the search for new spin liquids is a key direction of physics, chemistry, and materials science. Geometric frustration -- where the geometry of the net that the spins occupy precludes the generation of a simple ordered state -- is a particularly fruitful way to generate these intrinsically disordered states. A particular focus has been on a handful of high symmetry nets. There are, however, many three-dimensional nets, each of which has the potential to form unique states. In this paper, we investigate the high symmetry nets -- those which are both node- and edge-transitive -- for the simplest possible interaction sets: nearest-neighbor couplings of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and Ising spins. While the well-known crs (pyrochlore) net is the only nearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet which does not order, we identify two new frustrated nets (lcx and thp) that possess finite temperature Heisenberg spin-liquid states with strongly suppressed magnetic ordering and non-collinear ground states. With Ising spins, we identify three new classical spin liquids that do not order down to $T/J = 0.01$. We highlight materials that contain these high symmetry nets, and which could, if substituted with appropriate magnetic ions, potentially host these unusual states. Our systematic survey will guide searches for novel magnetic phases.</description>

Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of ``Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is increased interest in the heterogeneous integration of various compound semiconductors with Si for a variety of electronic and photonic applications. This paper focuses on integrating GaAsSb (with absorption in the C-band at 1550nm) with silicon to fabricate photodiodes, leveraging epitaxial layer transfer (ELT) methods. Two ELT techniques, epitaxial lift-off (ELO) and macro-transfer printing (MTP), are compared for transferring GaAsSb films from InP substrates to Si, forming PIN diodes. Characterization through atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibits a high-quality, defect-free interface. Current-voltage (IV) measurements and capacitance-voltage (CV) analysis validate the quality and functionality of the heterostructures. Photocurrent measurements at room temperature and 200 K demonstrate the device's photo-response at 1550 nm, highlighting the presence of an active interface.</description>
