      <title>An elementary proof of the existence and uniqueness of solutions to an initial value problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show a classical result on the local existence and uniqueness of a solution to an initial value problem subject to a Lipschitz condition. We use only elementary tools from mathematical analysis, without involving any integration. We proceed by showing that the Cauchy iterates converge on a dense subset of the interval and subsequently proving that the extension of this limit function to the whole interval is a solution to the Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Fourier Dimension and Translation Invariant Linear Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a translation invariant linear equation in four variables with integer coefficients of the form: $ax_1 +bx_2= cy_1+dy_2$. The main result of the paper states that any set on the real line with Fourier dimension greater than 1/2 must contain a nontrivial solution of such an equation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of weights on a connected finite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a connected finite graph, we propose an evolution of weights including Ollivier's Ricci flow as a special case. During the evolution process, on each edge, the speed of change of weight is exactly the difference between the Wasserstein distance related to two probability measures and certain graph distance. Here the probability measure may be chosen as an $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk, an $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk, or a general probability measure. Based on the ODE theory, we show that the initial value problem has a unique global solution.
  A discrete version of the above evolution is applied to the problem of community detection. Our algorithm is based on such a discrete evolution, where probability measures are chosen as $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk and $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk respectively. Note that the later measure has not been used in previous works [2, 16, 20, 23]. Here, as in [20], only one surgery needs to be performed after the last iteration. Moreover, our algorithm is much easier than those of [2, 16, 20], which were all based on Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci curvature. The code is available at https://github.com/mjc191812/Evolution-of-weights-on-a-connected-finite-graph.</description>

      <title>Random exponential sums and lattice points in regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study two fundamental problems on exponential sums via randomization of frequencies with stochastic processes. These are the Hardy-Littlewood majorant problem, and $L^{2n}(\mathbb{T}), \ n\in \mathbb{N}$ norms of exponential sums, which can also be interpreted as solutions of diophantine equations or lattice points on surfaces. We establish connections to the well known problems on lattice points in regions such as the Dirichlet divisor problem.</description>

      <title>New Sparse Domination and Weighted Estimates for Fractional Operators Beyond Calder\'on-Zygmund Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a closed, densely defined operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ satisfying suitable $L^p-L^q$ off-diagonal estimates of order $\kappa &gt; 0$. This paper aims to investigate the two-weight estimate and the Bloom weighted estimate for the fractional operator $L^{-\alpha/\kappa}$ with $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; n$ through the method of sparse domination. Our assumptions on the operators are minimal, and our result applies to a wide range of differential operators. As a byproduct, we also establish a new sparse domination criterion for a general class of fractional operators, including the classical fractional integral.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity for quasiminimal sets of codimension one in $\R^2$ and $\R^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiminimal sets are sets for which a pertubation can decrease the area but only in a controlled manner. We prove that in dimensions $2$ and $3$, such sets separate a locally finite family of local John domains. Reciprocally, we show that this property is a sufficient for quasiminimality. In addition, we show that quasiminimal sets locally separate the space in two components, except at isolated points in $\R^2$ or out a of subset of dimension strictly less than $N-1$ in $\R^N$.</description>

      <title>Rough differential equations in the flow approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the flow approach of Duch, with elementary differentials as coordinates, can be used to prove local well-posedness for rough stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H &gt; \frac{1}{4}$. A novelty appearing here is that we use coordinates for the flow that are indexed by trees rather than multi-indices.</description>

      <title>Finite Bivariate Biorthogonal M-Konhauser Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the pair of finite bivariate biorthogonal M-Konhauser polynomials, reduced to the finite orthogonal polynomials $M_{n}^{(p,q)}(t)$, by choosing appropriate parameters in order to obtain a relation between the Jacobi Konhauser polynomials and this new finite bivariate biorthogonal polynomials $_{K}M_{n;\upsilon}^{(p,q)}(z,t)$ similar to the relation between the classical Jacobi polynomials $P_{n}^{(p,q)}(t)$ and the finite orthogonal polynomials $M_{n}^{(p,q)}(t)$. Several properties like generating function, operational/integral representation are derived and some applications like fractional calculus, Fourier transform and Laplace transform are studied thanks to that new transition relation and the definition of finite bivariate M-Konhauser polynomials.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for the heat equation is equivalent to parabolic uniform rectifiability in the case of a parabolic Lipschitz graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a parabolic Lipschitz (i.e., Lip(1,1/2)) graph domain has the property that its caloric measure is a parabolic $A_\infty$ weight with respect to surface measure (which in turn is equivalent to $L^p$ solvability of the Dirichlet problem for some finite $p$), then the function defining the graph has a half-order time derivative in the space of (parabolic) bounded mean oscillation. Equivalently, we prove that the $A_\infty$ property of caloric measure implies, in this case, that the boundary is parabolic uniformly rectifiable. Consequently, by combining our result with the work of Lewis and Murray we resolve a long standing open problem in the field by characterizing those parabolic Lipschitz graph domains for which one has $L^p$ solvability (for some $p &lt;\infty$) of the Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. The key idea of our proof is to view the level sets of the Green function as extensions of the original boundary graph for which we can prove (local) square function estimates of Littlewood-Paley type.</description>

      <title>Stable polynomials and admissible numerators in product domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a polynomial $p$ with no zeros in the polydisk, or equivalently the poly-upper half-plane, we study the problem of determining the ideal of polynomials $q$ with the property that the rational function $q/p$ is bounded near a boundary zero of $p$. We give a complete description of this ideal of numerators in the case where the zero set of $p$ is smooth and satisfies a non-degeneracy condition. We also give a description of the ideal in terms of an integral closure when $p$ has an isolated zero on the distinguished boundary. Constructions of multivariate stable polynomials are presented to illustrate sharpness of our results and necessity of our assumptions.</description>
