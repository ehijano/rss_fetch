      <title>Fast 3D Partial Boundary Data EIT Reconstructions using Direct Inversion CGO-based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first partial boundary data complex geometrical optics based methods for electrical impedance tomography in three dimensions are developed, and tested, on simulated and experimental data. The methods provide good localization of targets for both absolute and time-difference imaging, when large portions of the domain are inaccessible for measurement. As most medical applications of electrical impedance tomography are limited to partial boundary data, the development of partial boundary algorithms is highly desirable. While iterative schemes have been used traditionally, their high computational cost makes them cost-prohibitive for applications that need fast imaging. The proposed algorithms require no iteration and provide informative absolute or time-difference images exceptionally quickly in under 2 seconds. Reconstructions are compared to reference reconstructions from standard linear difference imaging (30 seconds) and total variation regularized absolute imaging (several minutes) The algorithms perform well under high levels of noise and incorrect domain modeling.</description>

      <title>A recent evaluation on the performance of LLMs on radiation oncology physics using questions of randomly shuffled options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the latest released models.
  Methods: A set of 100 multiple-choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by us, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs -- OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exams. To evaluate their deductive reasoning abilities, the correct answer options in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompt was used to test if it improved their reasoning abilities. The performance of the LLMs was compared to medical physicists in majority-vote scenarios.
  Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists in majority-vote scenarios. When substituting the correct answer options with "None of the above," all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompt helped enhance the reasoning abilities of LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.
  Conclusion: These latest LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential for assisting in radiation oncology physics education.</description>

      <title>Biological and Radiological Dictionary of Radiomics Features: Addressing Understandable AI Issues in Personalized Prostate Cancer; Dictionary version PM1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the connection between visual semantic features in PI-RADS and associated risk factors, moving beyond abnormal imaging findings by creating a standardized dictionary of biological/radiological radiomics features (RFs). Using multiparametric prostate MRI sequences (T2-weighted imaging [T2WI], diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], and apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]), six interpretable and seven complex classifiers, combined with nine feature selection algorithms (FSAs), were applied to segmented lesions to predict UCLA scores. Combining T2WI, DWI, and ADC with FSAs such as ANOVA F-test, Correlation Coefficient, and Fisher Score, and utilizing logistic regression, identified key features: the 90th percentile from T2WI (hypo-intensity linked to cancer risk), variance from T2WI (lesion heterogeneity), shape metrics like Least Axis Length and Surface Area to Volume ratio from ADC (lesion compactness), and Run Entropy from ADC (texture consistency). This approach achieved an average accuracy of 0.78, outperforming single-sequence methods (p &lt; 0.05). The developed dictionary provides a common language, fostering collaboration between clinical professionals and AI developers to enable trustworthy, interpretable AI for reliable clinical decisions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Offline Pileup Correction to Improve the Accuracy of Microdosimetric Characterization in Clinical Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microdosimetry investigates the energy deposition of ionizing radiation at microscopic scales, beyond the assessment capabilities of macroscopic dosimetry. This contributes to an understanding of the biological response in radiobiology, radiation protection and radiotherapy. Microdosimetric pulse height spectra are usually measured using an ionization detector in a pulsed readout mode. This incorporates and a charge-sensitive amplifier followed by a shaping network. At high particle rates, the pileup of multiple pulses leads to distortions in the recorded spectra. Especially for gas-based detectors, this is a significant issue, that can be reduced by using solid-state detectors with smaller cross-sectional areas and faster readout speeds. At particle rates typical for ion therapy, however, such devices will also experience pileup. Mitigation techniques often focus on avoiding pileup altogether, while post-processing approaches are rarely investigated. This work explores pileup effects in microdosimetric measurements and presents a stochastic resampling algorithm, allowing for offline simulation and correction of spectra. Initially it was developed for measuring neutron spectra with tissue equivalent proportional counters and is adapted for the use with solid-state microdosimeters in a clinical radiotherapy setting. The algorithm was tested on data acquired with solid-state microdosimeters at the MedAustron ion therapy facility. The successful simulation and reduction of pileup counts is achieved by establishing of a limited number of parameters for a given setup. The presented results illustrate the potential of offline correction methods in situations where a direct pileup-free measurement is currently not practicable.</description>

      <title>Comparison of three reconstruction algorithms for low-dose phase-contrast computed tomography of the breast with synchrotron radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three different computed tomography (CT) reconstruction algorithms: Filtered Back Projection (FBP), Unified Tomographic Reconstruction (UTR) and customized Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (cSART), have been systematically compared and evaluated using experimental data from CT scans of ten fresh mastectomy samples collected at the Imaging and Medical beamline of the Australian Synchrotron. All the scans were collected at the mean glandular dose of 2 mGy, using monochromatic X-rays with 32 keV energy, flat-panel detectors with 0.1 mm pixels and 6 meter distance between the rotation stage and the detector. Paganin's phase retrieval method was used in conjunction with all three CT reconstruction algorithms. The reconstructed images were compared in terms of the objective image quality characteristics, including spatial resolution, contrast, signal-to-noise, and contrast-to-noise ratios. The images were also evaluated by seven experienced medical imaging specialists, rating perceptible contrast, sharpness of tissue interfaces, image noise, calcification visibility and overall image quality. Of the three compared algorithms, cSART was clearly superior to UTR and FBP in terms of most measured objective image quality characteristics. At the same time, the results of the subjective quality evaluation consistently favoured the images reconstructed by FBP, followed by UTR, with cSART receiving lower scores on average. We argue that this apparent disagreement between the objective and subjective assessments of image quality can be explained by the importance assigned to image contrast in the subjective assessment, while the signal-to-noise ratio seemed to receive relatively low weighting. This study was conducted in preparation for phase-contrast breast CT imaging of live patients at Australian Synchrotron (Melbourne, Australia).</description>

      <title>Joint Reconstruction of the Activity and the Attenuation in PET by Diffusion Posterior Sampling: a Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework for joint reconstruction of the activity and attenuation (JRAA) in positron emission tomography (PET) using diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), which leverages diffusion models (DMs) to address activity-attenuation dependencies and mitigate crosstalk issues in non-time-of-flight (TOF) settings; experimental evaluations with 2-dimensional (2-D) XCAT phantom data show that DPS outperforms traditional maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) methods, providing consistent, high-quality reconstructions even without TOF information.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron radiation-based tomography of an entire mouse brain with sub-micron voxels: augmenting interactive brain atlases with terabyte data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation-based X-ray microtomography is uniquely suited for post mortem three-dimensional visualization of organs such as the mouse brain. Tomographic imaging of the entire mouse brain with isotropic cellular resolution requires an extended field-of-view and produces datasets of multiple terabytes in size. These data must be processed and made accessible to domain experts who may have only limited image processing knowledge. We present extended-field X-ray microtomography with 0.65 $\mu$m voxel size covering an entire mouse brain. The 4,495 projections from 8 x 8 offset acquisitions were stitched to reconstruct a volume of 15,000$^3$ voxels. The microtomography volume was non-rigidly registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v3 based on a combination of image intensity and landmark pairs. The data were transformed block-wise and stored in a public repository with a hierarchical format for navigation and overlay with anatomical annotations in online viewers such as Neuroglancer or siibra-explorer. This study demonstrates X-ray imaging and data processing for a full mouse brain, augmenting current atlases by improving resolution in the third dimension by an order of magnitude. The 3.3-teravoxel dataset is publicly available and easily accessible for domain experts via browser-based viewers.</description>
