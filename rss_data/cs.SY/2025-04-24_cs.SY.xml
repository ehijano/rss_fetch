      <title>Path Integral Methods for Synthesizing and Preventing Stealthy Attacks in Nonlinear Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the synthesis and mitigation of stealthy attacks in nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPS). To quantify stealthiness, we employ the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a measure rooted in hypothesis testing and detection theory, which captures the trade-off between an attacker's desire to remain stealthy and her goal of degrading system performance. First, we synthesize the worst-case stealthy attack in nonlinear CPS using the path integral approach. Second, we consider how a controller can mitigate the impact of such stealthy attacks by formulating a minimax KL control problem, yielding a zero-sum game between the attacker and the controller. Again, we leverage a path integral-based solution that computes saddle-point policies for both players through Monte Carlo simulations. We validate our approach using unicycle navigation and cruise control problems, demonstrating how an attacker can covertly drive the system into unsafe regions, and how the controller can adapt her policy to combat the worst-case attacks.</description>

      <title>PACE: A Framework for Learning and Control in Linear Incomplete-Information Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information, particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Peer-Aware Cost Estimation in Nonlinear General-Sum Dynamic Games for Mutual Learning and Intent Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-robot interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum dynamic games since the objective functions of both agents are not explicitly known to each other. However, solving for equilibrium policies for such games presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ) approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety assurance. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables \textbf{intent communication} in such multi-agent systems by explicitly modeling the peer's learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Opt-ODENet: A Neural ODE Framework with Differentiable QP Layers for Safe and Stable Control Design (longer version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing controllers that achieve task objectives while ensuring safety is a key challenge in control systems. This work introduces Opt-ODENet, a Neural ODE framework with a differentiable Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization layer to enforce constraints as hard requirements. Eliminating the reliance on nominal controllers or large datasets, our framework solves the optimal control problem directly using Neural ODEs. Stability and convergence are ensured through Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) in the loss function, while Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) embedded in the QP layer enforce real-time safety. By integrating the differentiable QP layer with Neural ODEs, we demonstrate compatibility with the adjoint method for gradient computation, enabling the learning of the CBF class-$\mathcal{K}$ function and control network parameters. Experiments validate its effectiveness in balancing safety and performance.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Flow and the Bank: Stealthy Cyberattacks on Water Network Hydraulics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As water distribution networks (WDNs) become increasingly connected with digital infrastructures, they face greater exposure to cyberattacks that threaten their operational integrity. Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (SFDIAs) are particularly concerning, as they manipulate sensor data to compromise system operations while avoiding detection. While existing studies have focused on either detection methods or specific attack formulations, the relationship between attack sophistication, system knowledge requirements, and achievable impact remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of sensor attacks against WDNs, investigating different combinations of physical constraints, state monitoring requirements, and intrusion detection evasion conditions. We propose several attack formulations that range from tailored strategies satisfying both physical and detection constraints to simpler measurement manipulations. The proposed attacks are simple and local -- requiring knowledge only of targeted sensors and their hydraulic connections -- making them scalable and practical. Through case studies on Net1 and Net3 benchmark networks, we demonstrate how these attacks can persistently increase operational costs and alter water flows while remaining undetected by monitoring systems for extended periods. The analysis provides utilities with insights for vulnerability assessment and motivates the development of protection strategies that combine physical and statistical security mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Mitigation of Data injection Attacks against Data-Driven Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of false data injection attacks on data-driven control systems. Specifically, we consider an adversary injecting false data into the sensor channels during the learning phase. When the operator seeks to learn a stable state-feedback controller, we propose an attack strategy capable of misleading the operator into learning an unstable feedback gain. We also investigate the effects of constant-bias injection attacks on data-driven linear quadratic regulation (LQR). Finally, we explore potential mitigation strategies and support our findings with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Finding Conditions for Target Controllability under Christmas Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents new graph-theoretic conditions for structural target controllability of directed networks. After reviewing existing conditions and highlighting some gaps in the literature, we introduce a new class of network systems, named Christmas trees, which generalizes trees and cacti. We then establish a graph-theoretic characterization of sets of nodes that are structurally target controllable for a simple subclass of Christmas trees. Our characterization applies to general network systems by considering spanning subgraphs of Christmas tree class and allows us to uncover target controllable sets that existing criteria fail to identify.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Control for Autonomous Racing with Combustion Engine Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usually, a controller for path- or trajectory tracking is employed in autonomous driving. Typically, these controllers generate high-level commands like longitudinal acceleration or force. However, vehicles with combustion engines expect different actuation inputs. This paper proposes a longitudinal control concept that translates high-level trajectory-tracking commands to the required low-level vehicle commands such as throttle, brake pressure and a desired gear. We chose a modular structure to easily integrate different trajectory-tracking control algorithms and vehicles. The proposed control concept enables a close tracking of the high-level control command. An anti-lock braking system, traction control, and brake warmup control also ensure a safe operation during real-world tests. We provide experimental validation of our concept using real world data with longitudinal accelerations reaching up to $25 \, \frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{s}^2}$. The experiments were conducted using the EAV24 racecar during the first event of the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League on the Yas Marina Formula 1 Circuit.</description>

      <title>Admittance Identification of Grid-Forming Inverters Using Time and Frequency-Domain Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the power grid introduces new challenges, requiring detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) studies to analyze system interactions. Despite these needs, access to the internal firmware of power electronic devices remains restricted due to stringent nondisclosure agreements enforced by manufacturers. To address this, we explore three system identification techniques: sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA), step excitation method (SEM), and eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA). SFRA employs sinusoidal signals of varying frequencies to measure the system's frequency response, while SEM and ERA utilize step functions to derive time-domain responses and transform them into Laplace-domain transfer functions. All three approaches are shown to provide consistent results in identifying the dq admittance of grid-forming inverters (GFM) over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 Hz.</description>

      <title>On the Eigenvalue Tracking of Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the problem of tracking eigenvalue trajectories in large-scale power system models as system parameters vary. A continuation-based formulation is presented for tracing any single eigenvalue of interest, which supports sparse matrix representations and accommodates both explicit and semi-implicit differential-algebraic models. Key implementation aspects, such as numerical integration, matrix updates, derivative approximations, and handling defective eigenvalues, are discussed in detail and practical recommendations are duly provided. The tracking approach is demonstrated through a comprehensive case study on the IEEE 39-bus system, as well as on a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission system.</description>

      <title>SAPO-RL: Sequential Actuator Placement Optimization for Fuselage Assembly via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise assembly of composite fuselages is critical for aircraft assembly to meet the ultra-high precision requirements. Due to dimensional variations, there is a gap when two fuselage assemble. In practice, actuators are required to adjust fuselage dimensions by applying forces to specific points on fuselage edge through pulling or pushing force actions. The positioning and force settings of these actuators significantly influence the efficiency of the shape adjustments. The current literature usually predetermines the fixed number of actuators, which is not optimal in terms of overall quality and corresponding actuator costs. However, optimal placement of actuators in terms of both locations and number is challenging due to compliant structures, complex material properties, and dimensional variabilities of incoming fuselages. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables sequential decision-making for actuator placement selection and optimal force computation. Specifically, our methodology employs the Dueling Double Deep Q-Learning (D3QN) algorithm to refine the decision-making capabilities of sequential actuator placements. The environment is meticulously crafted to enable sequential and incremental selection of an actuator based on system states. We formulate the actuator selection problem as a submodular function optimization problem, where the sub-modularity properties can be adopted to efficiently achieve near-optimal solutions. The proposed methodology has been comprehensively evaluated through numerical studies and comparison studies, demonstrating its effectiveness and outstanding performance in enhancing assembly precision with limited actuator numbers.</description>

      <title>Are EVs Cleaner Than We Think? Evaluating Consequential Greenhouse Gas Emissions from EV Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While electrifying transportation eliminates tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electric vehicle (EV) adoption can create additional electricity sector emissions. To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption-average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions.</description>

      <title>Design and benchmarking of a two degree of freedom tendon driver unit for cable-driven wearable technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exosuits have recently been developed as alternatives to rigid exoskeletons and are increasingly adopted for both upper and lower limb therapy and assistance in clinical and home environments. Many cable-driven exosuits have been developed but little has been published on their electromechanical designs and performance. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive design and performance analysis of a two degree of freedom tendon driver unit (TDU) for cable-driven wearable exosuits. Detailed methodologies are presented to benchmark the functionality of the TDU. A static torque output test compares the commanded and measured torques. A velocity control test evaluates the attenuation and phase shift across velocities. A noise test evaluates how loud the TDU is for the wearer under different speeds. A thermal stress test captures the cooling performance of the TDU to ensure safe operation at higher loads. Finally, a battery endurance test evaluates the runtime of the TDU under various loading conditions to inform the usable time. To demonstrate these tests, a modular TDU system for cable-driven applications is introduced, which allows components such as motors, pulleys, and sensors to be adapted based on the requirements of the intended application. By sharing detailed methodologies and performance results, this study aims to provide a TDU design that may be leveraged by others and resources for researchers and engineers to better document the capabilities of their TDU designs.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formulation of Unified Force-Impedance Control on SE(3) for Robotic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an impedance control framework on the SE(3) manifold, which enables force tracking while guaranteeing passivity. Building upon the unified force-impedance control (UFIC) and our previous work on geometric impedance control (GIC), we develop the geometric unified force impedance control (GUFIC) to account for the SE(3) manifold structure in the controller formulation using a differential geometric perspective. As in the case of the UFIC, the GUFIC utilizes energy tank augmentation for both force-tracking and impedance control to guarantee the manipulator's passivity relative to external forces. This ensures that the end effector maintains safe contact interaction with uncertain environments and tracks a desired interaction force. Moreover, we resolve a non-causal implementation problem in the UFIC formulation by introducing velocity and force fields. Due to its formulation on SE(3), the proposed GUFIC inherits the desirable SE(3) invariance and equivariance properties of the GIC, which helps increase sample efficiency in machine learning applications where a learning algorithm is incorporated into the control law. The proposed control law is validated in a simulation environment under scenarios requiring tracking an SE(3) trajectory, incorporating both position and orientation, while exerting a force on a surface. The codes are available at https://github.com/Joohwan-Seo/GUFIC_mujoco.</description>

      <title>Singular Arcs in Optimal Control: Closed-loop Implementations without Workarounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular arcs emerge in the solutions of Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) when the optimal inputs on some finite time intervals cannot be directly obtained via the optimality conditions. Solving OCPs with singular arcs often requires tailored treatments, suitable for offline trajectory optimization. This approach can become increasingly impractical for online closed-loop implementations, especially for large-scale engineering problems. Recent development of Integrated Residual Methods (IRM) have indicated their suitability for handling singular arcs; the convergence of error measures in IRM automatically suppresses singular arc-induced fluctuations and leads to non-fluctuating solutions more suitable for practical problems. Through several examples, we demonstrate the advantages of solving OCPs with singular arcs using {IRM} under an economic model predictive control framework. In particular, the following observations are made: (i) IRM does not require special treatment for singular arcs, (ii) it solves the OCPs reliably with singular arc fluctuation suppressed, and (iii) the closed-loop results closely match the analytic optimal solutions.</description>

      <title>Neural Contraction Metrics with Formal Guarantees for Discrete-Time Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, which scales up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear examples.</description>

      <title>Subframework-based Bearing Rigidity Maintenance Control in Multirobot Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach for analyzing and controlling bearing rigidity in multi-robot networks with dynamic topology. By decomposing the system's framework into subframeworks, we express bearing rigidity, a global property, as a set of local properties, with rigidity eigenvalues serving as natural local rigidity metrics. We propose a decentralized, scalable, gradient-based controller that uses only bearing measurements to execute mission-specific commands. The controller preserves bearing rigidity by maintaining rigidity eigenvalues above a threshold, and also avoids inter-robot collisions. Simulations confirm the scheme's effectiveness, with information exchange confined to subframeworks, underscoring its scalability and practicality.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of an AI-driven workflow for dynamic x-ray spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for characterizing the chemical state and symmetry of individual elements within materials, but requires collecting data at many energy points which can be time-consuming. While adaptive sampling methods exist for efficiently collecting spectroscopic data, they often lack domain-specific knowledge about XANES spectra structure. Here we demonstrate a knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This approach advances the degree of automation in XANES experiments reducing the common errors of under- or over-sampling points in near the absorption edge and enabling dynamic experiments that require high temporal resolution or limited measurement time.</description>

      <title>Advancing Frontiers of Path Integral Theory for Stochastic Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) problems arise in systems influenced by uncertainty, such as autonomous robots or financial models. Traditional methods like dynamic programming are often intractable for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems due to the curse of dimensionality. This dissertation explores the path integral control framework as a scalable, sampling-based alternative. By reformulating SOC problems as expectations over stochastic trajectories, it enables efficient policy synthesis via Monte Carlo sampling and supports real-time implementation through GPU parallelization.
  We apply this framework to six classes of SOC problems: Chance-Constrained SOC, Stochastic Differential Games, Deceptive Control, Task Hierarchical Control, Risk Mitigation of Stealthy Attacks, and Discrete-Time LQR. A sample complexity analysis for the discrete-time case is also provided. These contributions establish a foundation for simulator-driven autonomy in complex, uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation in ODE Models with Certified Polynomial System Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider dynamical models given by rational ODE systems. Parameter estimation is an important and challenging task of recovering parameter values from observed data. Recently, a method based on differential algebra and rational interpolation was proposed to express parameter estimation in terms of polynomial system solving. Typically, polynomial system solving is a bottleneck, hence the choice of the polynomial solver is crucial. In this contribution, we compare two polynomial system solvers applied to parameter estimation: homotopy continuation solver from HomotopyContinuation.jl and our new implementation of a certified solver based on rational univariate representation (RUR) and real root isolation. We show how the new RUR solver can tackle examples that are out of reach for the homotopy methods and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Obtaining Structural Network Controllability with Higher-Order Local Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a network of identical, first-order linear systems, and investigate how replacing a subset of the systems composing the network with higher-order ones, either taken to be generic or specifically designed, may affect its controllability. After establishing a correspondence between state controllability in networks of first-order systems with output controllability in networks of higher-order systems, we show that adding higher-order dynamics may require significantly fewer subsystem modifications to achieve structural controllability, when compared to first-order heterogeneous subsystems. Furthermore, we characterize the topology of networks (which we call X-networks) in which the introduction of heterogeneous local dynamics is not necessary for structural output controllability, as the latter can be attained by suitable higher-order subsystems with homogeneous internal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Flying through cluttered and dynamic environments with LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through cluttered and dynamic environments remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with fast-moving or sudden-appearing obstacles. This paper introduces a complete LiDAR-based system designed to enable UAVs to avoid various moving obstacles in complex environments. Benefiting the high computational efficiency of perception and planning, the system can operate in real time using onboard computing resources with low latency. For dynamic environment perception, we have integrated our previous work, M-detector, into the system. M-detector ensures that moving objects of different sizes, colors, and types are reliably detected. For dynamic environment planning, we incorporate dynamic object predictions into the integrated planning and control (IPC) framework, namely DynIPC. This integration allows the UAV to utilize predictions about dynamic obstacles to effectively evade them. We validate our proposed system through both simulations and real-world experiments. In simulation tests, our system outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across several metrics, including success rate, time consumption, average flight time, and maximum velocity. In real-world trials, our system successfully navigates through forests, avoiding moving obstacles along its path.</description>

      <title>Unifying Complementarity Constraints and Control Barrier Functions for Safe Whole-Body Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical whole-body robot control demands reactive methods that ensure collision avoidance in real-time. Complementarity constraints and control barrier functions (CBF) have emerged as core tools for ensuring such safety constraints, and each represents a well-developed field. Despite addressing similar problems, their connection remains largely unexplored. This paper bridges this gap by formally proving the equivalence between these two methodologies for sampled-data, first-order systems, considering both single and multiple constraint scenarios. By demonstrating this equivalence, we provide a unified perspective on these techniques. This unification has theoretical and practical implications, facilitating the cross-application of robustness guarantees and algorithmic improvements between complementarity and CBF frameworks. We discuss these synergistic benefits and motivate future work in the comparison of the methods in more general cases.</description>

      <title>Fault Diagnosis in New Wind Turbines using Knowledge from Existing Turbines by Generative Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.</description>

      <title>Recursive feasibility for stochastic MPC and the rationale behind fixing flat tires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of designing stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) schemes for linear systems affected by unbounded disturbances. The contribution of the paper is rooted in a measured-state initialization strategy. First, due to the nonzero probability of violating chance-constraints in the case of unbounded noise, we introduce ellipsoidal-based probabilistic reachable sets and we include constraint relaxations to recover recursive feasibility conditioned to the measured state. Second, we prove that the solution of this novel SMPC scheme guarantees closed-loop chance constraints satisfaction under minimum relaxation. Last, we demonstrate that, in expectation, the need of relaxing the constraints vanishes over time, which leads the closed-loop trajectories steered towards the unconstrained LQR invariant region. This novel SMPC scheme is proven to satisfy the recursive feasibility conditioned to the state realization, and its superiority with respect to open-loop initialization schemes is shown through numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many energy-based control strategies for mechanical systems require the choice of a Coriolis factorization satisfying a skew-symmetry property. This paper (a) explores if and when a control designer has flexibility in this choice, (b) develops a canonical choice related to the Christoffel symbols, and (c) describes how to efficiently perform control computations with it for constrained mechanical systems. We link the choice of a Coriolis factorization to the notion of an affine connection on the configuration manifold and show how properties of the connection relate with the associated factorization. In particular, the factorization based on the Christoffel symbols is linked with a torsion-free property that can limit the twisting of system trajectories during passivity-based control. We then develop a way to induce Coriolis factorizations for constrained mechanisms from unconstrained ones, which provides a pathway to use the theory for efficient control computations with high-dimensional systems such as humanoids and quadruped robots with open- and closed-chain mechanisms. A collection of algorithms is provided (and made available open source) to support the recursive computation of passivity-based control laws, adaptation laws, and regressor matrices in future applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing share of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources in power systems is increasing the need for short term operational flexibility, particularly from large industrial electricity consumers. This study proposes a practical, two stage optimization framework to unlock this flexibility in cement manufacturing and support participation in electricity balancing markets. In Stage 1, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model minimizes electricity procurement costs by optimally scheduling the raw milling subsystem. In Stage 2, a flexibility assessment model evaluates profitable deviations, targeting participation in Spain manual Frequency Restoration Reserve (mFRR) market. A real world case study in a Spanish cement plant (including PV and battery storage) shows that flexibility services can yield monthly revenues of up to 800 EUR and paybacks as short as six years. This framework offers a replicable pathway for industrial flexibility in energy intensive sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic pattern prediction has emerged as a promising approach for efficiently managing and mitigating the impacts of event-driven bursty traffic in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) networks. However, achieving accurate predictions of bursty traffic remains a non-trivial task due to the inherent randomness of events, and these challenges intensify within live network environments. Consequently, there is a compelling imperative to design a lightweight and agile framework capable of assimilating continuously collected data from the network and accurately forecasting bursty traffic in mMTC networks. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a machine learning-based framework tailored for forecasting bursty traffic in multi-channel slotted ALOHA networks. The proposed machine learning network comprises long-term short-term memory (LSTM) and a DenseNet with feed-forward neural network (FFNN) layers, where the residual connections enhance the training ability of the machine learning network in capturing complicated patterns. Furthermore, we develop a new low-complexity online prediction algorithm that updates the states of the LSTM network by leveraging frequently collected data from the mMTC network. Simulation results and complexity analysis demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of both accuracy and complexity, making it well-suited for time-critical live scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in a network with a single base station and thousands of devices organized into groups with distinct traffic-generating characteristics. Comprehensive evaluations and simulations indicate that our proposed machine learning approach achieves a remarkable $52\%$ higher accuracy in long-term predictions compared to traditional methods, without imposing additional processing load on the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust model predictive control algorithms are essential for addressing unavoidable errors due to the uncertainty in predicting real-world systems. However, the formulation of such algorithms typically results in a trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity. Monotone systems facilitate the efficient computation of reachable sets and thus the straightforward formulation of a robust model predictive control approach optimizing over open-loop predictions. We present an approach based on the division of reachable sets to incorporate feedback in the predictions, resulting in less conservative strategies. The concept of mixed-monotonicity enables an extension of our methodology to non-monotone systems. The potential of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through a nonlinear high-dimensional chemical tank reactor cascade case study.</description>

Abstract: System level synthesis (SLS) is a controller parameterization technique that facilitates synthesis of structured distributed controllers via convex optimization. Past results on SLS are primarily in the discrete-time setting; this paper extends SLS to the continuous-time setting. We translate the parametrization and associated constraints to continuous-time, and propose a controller design procedure consisting of two steps: (1) selection of poles and (2) optimization over closed-loop responses. We provide SLS parameterizations for continuous-time $\H2$ and $\Hinf$ control, and show that the proposed procedure allows us to design structured $\H2$ and $\Hinf$ controllers via convex optimization. Furthermore, the proposed procedure preserves the scalability and local-disturbance-rejection features of the original discrete-time SLS framework. We verify our findings in simulation -- on a grid of 9 nodes governed by linearized swing equations, our structured distributed controllers perform similarly to the optimal centralized controllers.</description>

      <title>Automated Discovery of Operable Dynamics from Videos</title>

Abstract: Dynamical systems form the foundation of scientific discovery, traditionally modeled with predefined state variables such as the angle and angular velocity, and differential equations such as the equation of motion for a single pendulum. We introduce a framework that automatically discovers a low-dimensional and operable representation of system dynamics, including a set of compact state variables that preserve the smoothness of the system dynamics and a differentiable vector field, directly from video without requiring prior domain-specific knowledge. The prominence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative analyses of a range of dynamical systems, including the identification of stable equilibria, the prediction of natural frequencies, and the detection of of chaotic and limit cycle behaviors. The results highlight the potential of our data-driven approach to advance automated scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Control Framework for Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a unified approach to quadratic optimal control for both linear and nonlinear discrete-time systems, with a focus on trajectory tracking. The control strategy is based on minimizing a quadratic cost function that penalizes deviations of system states and control inputs from their desired trajectories.
  For linear systems, the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution is derived using dynamic programming, resulting in recursive equations for feedback and feedforward terms. For nonlinear dynamics, the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) method is employed, which iteratively linearizes the system and solves a sequence of LQR problems to converge to an optimal policy.
  To implement this approach, a software service was developed and tested on several canonical models, including: Rayleigh oscillator, inverted pendulum on a moving cart, two-link manipulator, and quadcopter. The results confirm that iLQR enables efficient and accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of nonlinearities.
  To further enhance performance, it can be seamlessly integrated with Model Predictive Control (MPC), enabling online adaptation and improved robustness to constraints and system uncertainties.</description>

      <title>One-Point Sampling for Distributed Bandit Convex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the distributed bandit convex optimization problem with time-varying constraints. In this problem, the global loss function is the average of all the local convex loss functions, which are unknown beforehand. Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal-dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation are achieved if the path-length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal{O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4} )$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}} )$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>SE(3)-Equivariant Robot Learning and Control: A Tutorial Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have driven major breakthroughs in robotics by employing techniques such as imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM-based multimodal perception and decision-making. However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.</description>

      <title>A three-axis Nanopositioner based on Near-Field Acoustic Levitation and Electromagnetic Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-field acoustic levitation (NFAL) enables nanometer-scale positioning resolution and bandwidth exceeding several hundred hertz specifically along the vertical (Z) direction, owing to its high acoustic stiffness and squeeze film damping. However, its application to horizontal (XY) positioning is limited by significantly lower acoustic stiffness and insufficient damping in horizontal directions, resulting in reduced resolution and bandwidth. Moreover, NFAL-based positioning systems typically lack multi-axis actuation capabilities due to challenges in generating multi-directional acoustic forces. This work presents a hybrid positioning approach that overcomes the mentioned limitations by integrating NFAL with electromagnetic actuation. A planar magnetic platform is acoustically levitated, while a coplanar current-carrying coil provides horizontal trapping stiffness more than three orders of magnitude higher than that achievable with acoustic forces alone. Additionally, the coil generates three-dimensional electromagnetic forces, enabling multi-axis positioning capability. Eddy currents induced in a thin copper sheet integrated with the coil enhance horizontal damping by 52 times. We experimentally demonstrate precise 3-axis linear motion with a root mean square (RMS) positioning resolution better than 20 nm along all axes. The system achieves an in-plane motion range of 1.42 mm with a bandwidth of 16 Hz and a Z-axis motion range of 40 micrometers with a positioning bandwidth of 171 Hz.</description>

      <title>Fast Online Adaptive Neural MPC via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.</description>
