      <title>Coupled Boundary Element and Finite Volume Methods for Modeling Fluid-Induced Seismicity in Fault Networks within Low-Permeability Rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better understand the mechanics of injection-induced seismicity, we developed a two-dimensional numerical code to simulate both seismic and aseismic slip on non-planar faults and fault networks driven by fluid diffusion along permeable faults. Our approach integrates a boundary element method to model fault slip governed by rate-and-state friction with a finite volume method for simulating fluid diffusion along fault networks. We demonstrate the method's capabilities with two illustrative examples: (1) fluid injection inducing slow slip on a primary rough, rate-strengthening fault, which subsequently triggers microseismicity on secondary, smaller faults, and (2) fluid injection on a single fault in a network of intersecting faults, leading to fluid diffusion and reactivation of slip throughout the network. In both cases, the simulated slow slip migrates more rapidly than the fluid pressure diffusion front. The observed migration patterns of microseismicity in the first example and slow slip in the second example resemble diffusion processes but involve diffusivity values that differ significantly from the fault hydraulic diffusivity. These results support the conclusion that the microseismicity front is not a direct proxy for the fluid diffusion front and cannot be used to directly infer hydraulic diffusivity, consistently with some decametric scale in-situ experiments of fault activation under controlled conditions. This work highlights the importance of distinguishing between mechanical and hydrological processes in the analysis of induced seismicity, providing a powerful tool for improving our understanding of fault behavior in response to fluid injection, in particular when a network of faults is involved.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes for Probabilistic Estimates of Earthquake Ground Shaking: A 1-D Proof-of-Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimates of seismic wave speeds in the Earth (seismic velocity models) are key input parameters to earthquake simulations for ground motion prediction. Owing to the non-uniqueness of the seismic inverse problem, typically many velocity models exist for any given region. The arbitrary choice of which velocity model to use in earthquake simulations impacts ground motion predictions. However, current hazard analysis methods do not account for this source of uncertainty. We present a proof-of-concept ground motion prediction workflow for incorporating uncertainties arising from inconsistencies between existing seismic velocity models. Our analysis is based on the probabilistic fusion of overlapping seismic velocity models using scalable Gaussian process (GP) regression. Specifically, we fit a GP to two synthetic 1-D velocity profiles simultaneously, and show that the predictive uncertainty accounts for the differences between the models. We subsequently draw velocity model samples from the predictive distribution and estimate peak ground displacement using acoustic wave propagation through the velocity models. The resulting distribution of possible ground motion amplitudes is much wider than would be predicted by simulating shaking using only the two input velocity models. This proof-of-concept illustrates the importance of probabilistic methods for physics-based seismic hazard analysis.</description>

      <title>Satellite monitoring of long period ocean-induced magnetic field variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite magnetic field observations have the potential to provide valuable information on dynamics, heat content and salinity throughout the ocean. Here we present the expected spatio-temporal characteristics of the ocean-induced magnetic field at satellite altitude on periods of months to decades. We compare these to the characteristics of other sources of Earth's magnetic field, and discuss whether it is feasible for the ocean-induced magnetic field to be retrieved and routinely monitored from space. We focus on large length scales (spherical harmonic degrees up to 30) and periods from one month up to five years. To characterize the expected ocean signal we make use of advanced numerical simulations taking high resolution oceanographic inputs and solve the magnetic induction equation in 3D including galvanic coupling and self induction effects. We find the time-varying ocean-induced signal dominates over the primary source of the internal field, the core dynamo, at high spherical harmonic degree with the cross-over taking place at degree 15 to 20 depending on the considered period. The ionospheric and magnetospheric fields (including their Earth induced counterparts) have most power on periods shorter than one month and are expected to be mostly zonal in magnetic coordinates at satellite altitude. Based on these findings we discuss future prospects for isolating and monitoring long period ocean induced magnetic field variations using data collected by present and upcoming magnetic survey satellites.</description>
