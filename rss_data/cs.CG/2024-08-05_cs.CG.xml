      <title>Computation of $\gamma$-linear projected barcodes for multiparameter persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-linear projected barcode was recently introduced as an alternative to the well-known fibered barcode for multiparameter persistence, in which restrictions of the modules to lines are replaced by pushforwards of the modules along linear forms in the polar of some fixed cone $\gamma$. So far, the computation of the $\gamma$-linear projected barcode has only been studied in the functional setting, in which persistence modules come from the persistent cohomology of $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued functions. Here we develop a method that works in the algebraic setting directly, for any multiparameter persistence module over $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is given via a finite free resolution. Our approach is similar to that of RIVET: first, it pre-processes the resolution to build an arrangement in the dual of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a barcode template in each face of the arrangement; second, given any query linear form $u$ in the polar of $\gamma$, it locates $u$ within the arrangement to produce the corresponding barcode efficiently. While our theoretical complexity bounds are similar to the ones of RIVET, our arrangement turns out to be simpler thanks to the linear structure of the space of linear forms. Our theoretical analysis combines sheaf-theoretic and module-theoretic techniques, showing that multiparameter persistence modules can be converted into a special type of complexes of sheaves on vector spaces called conic-complexes, whose derived pushforwards by linear forms have predictable barcodes.</description>

      <title>Resampling and averaging coordinates on data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce algorithms for robustly computing intrinsic coordinates on point clouds. Our approach relies on generating many candidate coordinates by subsampling the data and varying hyperparameters of the embedding algorithm (e.g., manifold learning). We then identify a subset of representative embeddings by clustering the collection of candidate coordinates and using shape descriptors from topological data analysis. The final output is the embedding obtained as an average of the representative embeddings using generalized Procrustes analysis. We validate our algorithm on both synthetic data and experimental measurements from genomics, demonstrating robustness to noise and outliers.</description>

      <title>A faster algorithm for the Fr\'echet distance in 1D for the imbalanced case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fine-grained complexity of computing the Fr\'echet distance has been a topic of much recent work, starting with the quadratic SETH-based conditional lower bound by Bringmann from 2014. Subsequent work established largely the same complexity lower bounds for the Fr\'echet distance in 1D. However, the imbalanced case, which was shown by Bringmann to be tight in dimensions $d\geq 2$, was still left open. Filling in this gap, we show that a faster algorithm for the Fr\'echet distance in the imbalanced case is possible: Given two 1-dimensional curves of complexity $n$ and $n^{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha \in (0,1)$, we can compute their Fr\'echet distance in $O(n^{2\alpha} \log^2 n + n \log n)$ time. This rules out a conditional lower bound of the form $O((nm)^{1-\epsilon})$ that Bringmann showed for $d \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ in turn showing a strict separation with the setting $d=1$. At the heart of our approach lies a data structure that stores a 1-dimensional curve $P$ of complexity $n$, and supports queries with a curve $Q$ of complexity~$m$ for the continuous Fr\'echet distance between $P$ and $Q$. The data structure has size in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ and uses query time in $\mathcal{O}(m^2 \log^2 n)$. Our proof uses a key lemma that is based on the concept of visiting orders and may be of independent interest. We demonstrate this by substantially simplifying the correctness proof of a clustering algorithm by Driemel, Krivo\v{s}ija and Sohler from 2015.</description>
