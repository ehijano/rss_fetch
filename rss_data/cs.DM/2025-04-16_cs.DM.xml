      <title>Token Sliding Reconfiguration on DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and two independent sets of same size, the Independent Set Reconfiguration Problem under token sliding ask whether one can, in a step by step manner, transform the first independent set into the second one. In each step we must preserve the condition of independence. Further, referring to solution vertices as tokens, we are only permitted to slide a token along an edge. Until the recent work of Ito et al. [Ito et al. MFCS 2022] this problem was only considered on undirected graphs. In this work, we study reconfiguration under token sliding focusing on DAGs.
  We present a complete dichotomy of intractability in regard to the depth of the DAG, by proving that this problem is NP-complete for DAGs of depth 3 and $\textrm{W}[1]$-hard for depth 4 when parameterized by the number of tokens $k$, and that these bounds are tight. Further, we prove that it is fixed parameter tractable on DAGs parameterized by the combination of treewidth and $k$. We show that this result applies to undirected graphs, when the number of times a token can visit a vertex is restricted.</description>

      <title>Re-imagining Spectral Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Laplacian based on general inner product spaces, which we call the inner product Laplacian. We show the combinatorial and normalized graph Laplacians, as well as other Laplacians for hypergraphs and directed graphs, are special cases of the inner product Laplacian. After developing the necessary basic theory for the inner product Laplacian, we establish generalized analogs of key isoperimetric inequalities, including the Cheeger inequality and expander mixing lemma. Dirichlet and Neumann subgraph eigenvalues may also be recovered as appropriate limit points of a sequence of inner product Laplacians. In addition to suggesting a new context through which to examine existing Laplacians, this generalized framework is also flexible in applications: through choice of an inner product on the vertices and edges of a graph, the inner product Laplacian naturally encodes both combinatorial structure and domain-knowledge.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotics of the Connectivity Probability of Random Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the exact asymptotic behavior of the connectivity probability in a random binomial bipartite graph $G(n,m,p)$ under various regimes of the edge probability $p=p(n)$. To determine this probability, a method based on the analysis of inhomogeneous random walks is proposed.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hardness of Online Algorithms for Large Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding a large independent set in an Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. For constant $p$ and $b=1/(1-p)$, the largest independent set has size $2\log_b n$, while a simple greedy algorithm revealing vertices sequentially and making decisions based only on previously seen vertices finds an independent set of size $\log_b n$. In his seminal 1976 paper, Karp challenged to either improve this guarantee or establish its hardness. Decades later, this problem remains open, one of the most prominent algorithmic problems in the theory of random graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that a broad class of online algorithms fails to find an independent set of size $(1+\epsilon)\log_b n$ any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ w.h.p. This class includes Karp's algorithm as a special case, and extends it by allowing the algorithm to query exceptional edges not yet 'seen' by the algorithm. Our lower bound holds for all $p\in [d/n,1-n^{-1/d}]$, where $d$ is a large constant. In the dense regime (constant $p$), we further prove that our result is asymptotically tight with respect to the number of exceptional edges queried, by designing an online algorithm which beats the half-optimality threshold when the number of exceptional edges slightly exceeds our bound.
  Our result provides evidence for the algorithmic hardness of Karp's problem by supporting the conjectured optimality of the aforementioned greedy algorithm and establishing it within the class of online algorithms. Our proof relies on a refined analysis of the geometric structure of tuples of large independent sets, establishing a variant of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) commonly used as a barrier for classes of algorithms. While OGP has predominantly served as a barrier to stable algorithms, online algorithms are not stable and our application of OGP-based techniques to online setting is novel.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Geophylogenies -- Internal and External Labeling with Phylogenetic Tree Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geophylogeny is a phylogenetic tree (or dendrogram) where each leaf (e.g. biological taxon) has an associated geographic location (site). To clearly visualize a geophylogeny, the tree is typically represented as a crossing-free drawing next to a map. The correspondence between the taxa and the sites is either shown with matching labels on the map (internal labeling) or with leaders that connect each site to the corresponding leaf of the tree (external labeling). In both cases, a good order of the leaves is paramount for understanding the association between sites and taxa. We define several quality measures for internal labeling and give an efficient algorithm for optimizing them. In contrast, minimizing the number of leader crossings in an external labeling is NP-hard. On the positive side, we show that crossing-free instances can be solved in polynomial time and give a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm. Furthermore, optimal solutions can be found in a matter of seconds on realistic instances using integer linear programming. Finally, we provide several efficient heuristic algorithms and experimentally show them to be near optimal on real-world and synthetic instances.</description>

      <title>Moving a Derivation Along a Derivation Preserves the Spine in Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13510v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two elementary operations on derivations in the framework of graph transformation based on adhesive categories: moving a derivation along a derivation based on parallel and sequential independence on one hand and restriction of a derivation with respect to a monomorphism into the start object on the other hand. Intuitively, a restriction clips off parts of the start object that are never matched by a rule application throughout the derivation on the other hand. As main result, it is shown that moving a derivation preserves its spine being the minimal restriction.</description>

      <title>A characterization of positive spanning sets with ties to strongly connected digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positive spanning sets (PSSs) are families of vectors that span a given linear space through non-negative linear combinations. Despite certain classes of PSSs being well understood, a complete characterization of PSSs remains elusive. In this paper, we explore a relatively understudied relationship between positive spanning sets and strongly edge-connected digraphs, in that the former can be viewed as a generalization of the latter. We leverage this connection to define a decomposition structure for positive spanning sets inspired by the ear decomposition from digraph theory.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Structure of Universal Partial Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal partial cycle (or upcycle) for $\mathcal{A}^n$ is a cyclic sequence that covers each word of length $n$ over the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ exactly once -- like a De Bruijn cycle, except that we also allow a wildcard symbol $\mathord{\diamond}$ that can represent any letter of $\mathcal{A}$. Chen et al. in 2017 and Goeckner et al. in 2018 showed that the existence and structure of upcycles are highly constrained, unlike those of De Bruijn cycles, which exist for every alphabet size and word length. Moreover, it was not known whether any upcycles existed for $n \ge 5$. We present several examples of upcycles over both binary and non-binary alphabets for $n = 8$. We generalize two graph-theoretic representations of De Bruijn cycles to upcycles. We then introduce novel approaches to constructing new upcycles from old ones. Notably, given any upcycle for an alphabet of size $a$, we show how to construct an upcycle for an alphabet of size $ak$ for any $k \in \mathbb{N}$, so each example generates an infinite family of upcycles. We also define folds and lifts of upcycles, which relate upcycles with differing densities of $\mathord{\diamond}$ characters. In particular, we show that every upcycle lifts to a De Bruijn cycle. Our constructions rely on a different generalization of De Bruijn cycles known as perfect necklaces, and we introduce several new examples of perfect necklaces. We extend the definitions of certain pseudorandomness properties to partial words and determine which are satisfied by all upcycles, then draw a conclusion about linear feedback shift registers. Finally, we prove new nonexistence results based on the word length $n$, alphabet size, and $\mathord{\diamond}$ density.</description>

      <title>Simplifying modular lattices by removing doubly irreducible elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattices are simplified by removing some of their doubly irreducible elements, resulting in smaller lattices called racks. All vertically indecomposable modular racks of $n \le 40$ elements are listed, and the numbers of all modular lattices of $n \le 40$ elements are obtained by P\'olya counting. SageMath code is provided that allows easy access both to the listed racks, and to the modular lattices that were not listed. More than 3000-fold savings in storage space are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Membership problems in nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15504v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study both the Submonoid Membership problem and the Rational Subset Membership problem in finitely generated nilpotent groups. We give two reductions with important applications. First, Submonoid Membership in any nilpotent group can be reduced to Rational Subset Membership in smaller groups. As a corollary, we prove the existence of a group with decidable Submonoid Membership and undecidable Rational Subset Membership, confirming a conjecture of Lohrey and Steinberg. Second, the Rational Subset Membership problem in $H_3(\mathbb Z)$ can be reduced to the Knapsack problem in the same group, and is therefore decidable. Combining both results, we deduce that the filiform $3$-step nilpotent group has decidable Submonoid Membership.</description>

      <title>Generation of Cycle Permutation Graphs and Permutation Snarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the efficient generation of all pairwise non-isomorphic cycle permutation graphs, i.e. cubic graphs with a $2$-factor consisting of two chordless cycles, non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs and permutation snarks, i.e. cycle permutation graphs that do not admit a $3$-edge-colouring. This allows us to generate all cycle permutation graphs up to order $34$ and all permutation snarks up to order $46$, improving upon previous computational results by Brinkmann et al. Moreover, we give several improved lower bounds for interesting permutation snarks, such as for a smallest permutation snark of order $6 \bmod 8$ or a smallest permutation snark of girth at least $6$. These computational results also allow us to complete a characterisation of the orders for which non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs exist, answering an open question by Klee from 1972, and yield many more counterexamples to a conjecture by Zhang.</description>
