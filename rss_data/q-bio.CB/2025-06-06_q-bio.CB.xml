      <title>Bacterial Chemotaxis in a Traveling Wave Attractant Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study single cell E.coli chemotaxis in a spatio-temporally varying attractant environment. Modeling the attractant concentration in the form of a traveling sine wave, we measure in our simulations, the chemotactic drift velocity of the cell for different propagation speed of the attractant wave. We find a highly non-trivial dependence where the chemotactic drift velocity changes sign, and also shows multiple peaks. For slowly moving attractant wave, drift velocity is negative, i.e. the drift motion is directed opposite to wave propagation. As the wave speed increases, drift velocity shows a negative peak, then changes sign, reaches a positive peak and finally becomes zero when the wave moves too fast for the cell to respond. We explain this rich behavior from the difference in attractant gradient perceived by the cell during its run along the propagation direction and opposite to it. In particular, when the cell moves in the same direction as the wave, the relative velocity of the cell with respect to the wave becomes zero when the wave speed matches the run speed. In this limit, the cell is able to ride the wave and experiences no concentration gradient during these runs. On the contrary, for runs in the opposite direction, no such effect is present and the effective gradient increases monotonically with the wave speed. We show, using detailed quantitative measurements, how this difference gives rise to the counter-intuitive behavior of chemotactic drift velocity described above.</description>
