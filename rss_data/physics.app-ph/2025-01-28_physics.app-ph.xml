      <title>Shape Morphing Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials leverage geometric design to achieve unconventional properties, such as high strength at low density, efficient wave guiding, and complex shape morphing. The ability to control shape changes builds on the complex relationship between geometry and nonlinear mechanics, and opens new possibilities for disruptive technologies across diverse fields, including wearable devices, medical technology, robotics, and beyond. In this review of shape-morphing metamaterials, we examine the current state of the field and propose a unified classification system for the mechanisms involved, as well as the design principles underlying them. Specifically, we explore two main categories of unit cells-those that exploit structural anisotropy or internal rotations-and two potential approaches to tessellating these cells: based on kinematic compatibility or geometric frustration. We conclude by discussing the available design tools and highlighting emerging challenges in the development of shape-morphing metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Array oscillator in coupled waveguides with nonlinear gain and radiation resistances saturating at exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A periodically loaded waveguide composed of periodic discrete nonlinear gain and radiating elements supports a stable oscillation regime related to the presence of an exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD). After reaching saturation, the EPD in the system establishes the oscillation frequency. We demonstrate a synchronization regime at a stable oscillation frequency, resulting in uniform saturated gain across the array and uniform radiating power. Unlike conventional one-dimensional cavity resonances, the oscillation frequency is independent of the array length. Our investigations further show that when small-signal gain is non-uniformly distributed across the array, the saturated gain results in having a uniform distribution at a gain value that generates an EPD. Experimental validation using the measured board confirmed that the system saturates at an EPD, with a measured spectrum exhibiting very low phase noise. This low noise allows for operation at a clean oscillation frequency. Additionally, the measured uniform power across the array corresponds to the simulation results. The proposed scheme can pave the way for a new generation of high-power radiating arrays with distributed active elements.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stability and Depinning Currents of Domain Wall-Based Artificial Synapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micromagnetic modeling is employed to optimize the design of artificial synapse devices based on the spin-orbit-torque (SOT) driven domain wall (DW) motion along a nanotrack with triangular notches. Key attributes, such as the thermal stability of the pinned DW and depinning currents, are obtained for varied nanotrack geometry and pinning strength. Depinning probability as a function of SOT current density and pulse width is studied using finite temperature micromagnetic simulations for varying pinning potential. Results show that wider notches provide better thermal stability - depinning current trade-off. On the other hand, narrow notches exhibit less variation in the depinning times at finite temperatures. It is observed that the DW position can be set precisely to any desired location by the SOT current pulse if the thermal stability is sufficiently high. It is also observed that the meta-plastic functionality can be obtained by adding notches of progressively higher depinning currents along the rectangular nanotrack.</description>

      <title>Engineering-Oriented Design of Drift-Resilient MTJ Random Number Generator via Hybrid Control Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest for secure and reliable random number generation, Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) have emerged as a promising technology due to their unique ability to exploit the stochastic nature of magnetization switching. This paper presents an engineering-oriented design of a drift-resilient MTJ-based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) utilizing a hybrid control strategy. We address the critical issue of switching probability drift, which can compromise the randomness and bias the output of MTJ-based TRNGs. Our approach combines a self-stabilization strategy, which dynamically adjusts the driving voltage based on real-time feedback, with pulse width modulation to enhance control over the switching probability. Through comprehensive experimental and simulation results, we demonstrate significant improvements in the stability, uniformity, and quality of the random numbers generated. The proposed system offers flexibility and adaptability for diverse applications, making it a reliable solution for high-quality randomness in cryptography, secure communications, and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Sides of Wafer: Physical Implementation and Block-Level PPA on Flip FET with Dual-sided Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the conventional scaling of logic devices comes to an end, functional wafer backside and 3D transistor stacking are consensus for next-generation logic technology, offering considerable design space extension for powers, signals or even devices on the wafer backside. The Flip FET (FFET), a novel transistor architecture combining 3D transistor stacking and fully functional wafer backside, was recently proposed. With symmetric dual-sided standard cell design, the FFET can deliver around 12.5% cell area scaling and faster but more energy-efficient libraries beyond other stacked transistor technologies such as CFET. Besides, thanks to the novel cell design with dual-sided pins, the FFET supports dual-sided signal routing, delivering better routability and larger backside design space. In this work, we demonstrated a comprehensive FFET evaluation framework considering physical implementation and block-level power-performance-area (PPA) assessment for the first time, in which key functions are dual-sided routing and dual-sided RC extraction. A 32-bit RISC-V core was used for the evaluation here. Compared to the CFET with single-sided signals, the FFET with single-sided signals achieved 23.3% post-P&amp;R core area reduction, 25.0% higher frequency and 11.9% lower power at the same utilization, and 16.0 % higher frequency at the same core area. Meanwhile, the FFET supports dual-sided signals, which can further benefit more from flexible allocation of cell input pins on both sides. By optimizing the input pin density and BEOL routing layer number on each side, 10.6% frequency gain was realized without power degradation compared to the one with single-sided signal routing. Moreover, the routability and power efficiency of FFET barely degrades even with the routing layer number reduced from 12 to 5 on each side, validating the great space for cost-friendly design enabled by FFET.</description>

      <title>RIS Assisted Wireless Communication: Advanced Modeling, Simulation, and Analytical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel perspective to model and simulate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication systems. Traditional methods in antenna design often rely on array method to simulate, whereas communication system modeling tends to idealize antenna behavior. Neither approach sufficiently captures the detailed characteristics of RIS-assisted communication. To address this limitation, we propose a comprehensive simulation framework that jointly models RIS antenna design and the communication process. This framework simulates the entire communication pipeline, encompassing signal generation, modulation, propagation, RIS-based radiation, signal reception, alignment, demodulation, decision, and processing. Using a QPSK-modulated signal for validation, we analyze system performance and investigate the relationship between bit error rate (BER), aperture fill time, array size, and baseband symbol frequency. The results indicate that larger array sizes and higher baseband symbol frequencies exacerbate aperture fill time effects, leading to increased BER. Furthermore, we examine BER variation with respect to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and propose an optimal matching-based alignment algorithm, which significantly reduces BER compared to conventional pilot-based alignment methods. This work demonstrates the entire process of RIS communication, and reveals the source of bit errors, which provides valuable insights into the design and performance optimization of RIS-assisted communication systems.</description>

      <title>Transformability reveals the interplay of dynamics across different network orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have investigated various dynamic processes characterizing collective behaviors in real-world systems. However, these dynamics have been studied individually in specific contexts. In this article, we present a holistic analysis framework that bridges the interplays between dynamics across networks of different orders, demonstrating that these processes are not independent but can undergo systematic transformations. Focusing on contagion dynamics, we identify and quantify dynamical and structural factors that explains the interplay between dynamics on higher-order and pairwise networks, uncovering a universal model for system instability governed by these factors. Furthermore, we validate the findings from contagion dynamics to opinion dynamics, highlighting its broader applicability across diverse dynamical processes. Our findings reveal the intrinsic coupling between diverse dynamical processes, providing fresh insights into the distinct role of complex dynamics governed by higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>DCIts -- Deep Convolutional Interpreter for time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an interpretable deep learning model for multivariate time series forecasting that prioritizes both predictive performance and interpretability - key requirements for understanding complex physical phenomena. Our model not only matches but often surpasses existing interpretability methods, achieving this without compromising accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate its ability to identify the most relevant time series and lags that contribute to forecasting future values, providing intuitive and transparent explanations for its predictions. To minimize the need for manual supervision, the model is designed so one can robustly determine the optimal window size that captures all necessary interactions within the smallest possible time frame. Additionally, it effectively identifies the optimal model order, balancing complexity when incorporating higher-order terms. These advancements hold significant implications for modeling and understanding dynamic systems, making the model a valuable tool for applied and computational physicists.</description>

      <title>Heliometric stereo: a new frontier in surface profilometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable measurements of three-dimensional surface structures are important for a broad range of technological and research applications, including materials science, nanotechnology, and biomedical research. Scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) uses low-energy (64 meV) neutral helium atoms as the imaging probe particles, providing a highly sensitive and delicate approach to measuring surface topography. To date, topographic SHeM measurements have been largely qualitative, but with the advent of the heliometric stereo method - a technique that combines multiple images to create a 3D representation of a surface - quantitative maps of surface topography may now be acquired with SHeM. Here, we present and discuss two different implementations of heliometric stereo on two separate instruments, a single detector SHeM and a multiple-detector SHeM. Both implementations show good accuracy (5% and 10% respectively) for recovering the shape of a surface. Additionally, we discuss where heliometric stereo is most applicable, identify contrast features that can limit its accuracy, and discuss how to mitigate these limitations with careful design and sample choices that be readily implemented on current instruments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits, caused by loss mechanisms like material imperfections and two-level system (TLS) defects, remains a major obstacle to improving the performance of quantum devices. In this work, we present atomic-level characterization of cross-sections of a Josephson junction and a spiral resonator to assess the quality of critical interfaces. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we identify structural imperfections associated with oxide layer formation and carbon-based contamination, and correlate these imperfections to the pattering and etching steps in the fabrication process and environmental exposure. These results help to understand that TLS imperfections at critical interfaces play a key role in limiting device performance, emphasizing the need for an improved fabrication process.</description>

      <title>Sensitive bioassay with an ultra-large dynamic range via microlaser ensemble quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a bioassay platform that leverages the lasing threshold distribution in a microlaser ensemble (ME), consisting of hundreds of individual microlasers, to measure analyte concentrations in solution. An ME is formed by placing dye-doped microbeads in a micro Fabry-Perot cavity. Microbeads are surface modified with biorecognition molecules to capture analytes, while the quenchers resulting from the presence of the analytes on the microbeads' surfaces increase the lasing thresholds of microlasers. Since the number of analytes varies from one microbead (or microlaser) to another due to the randomness in binding processes, a distribution of the analytes (and hence the quenchers) in the ME is created, which in turn leads to a lasing threshold distribution in the ME. Experimentally, multiple pumping energy densities are used to probe the lasing threshold distribution. A theoretical model is developed to map the lasing threshold distribution to analyte distribution in the ME, and then to recover the analyte concentration in solution. Using streptavidin and interleukin-6 as a model system, our platform achieves a detection limit of 0.1 pg/mL and a dynamic range exceeding five orders of magnitude, showing that the ME quenching method can provide a high sensitivity with a superior dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced Structure Change and Anomalies in Thermodynamic Quantities and Transport Properties in Liquid Lithium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understand the nature of liquid structure and its evolution under different conditions is a major challenge in condensed physics and materials science. Here, we report a pressure-induced structure change spanning a wide pressure range in liquid-state lithium hydride (LiH) by first-principles molecular dynamic simulations. This behavior can be described as a continuous crossover from low pressure liquid with Li$^+$-H$^-$ duality symmetry to high pressure one with broken of duality symmetry. The thermodynamic quantities such as heat capacity and ionic transport properties such as diffusivity are also saliently impacted. It is important to stress that such behavior is firstly predicted for this category of materials, which is ubiquitous in universe as well as in industry applications. Lastly, a comprehensive high-pressure high-temperature phase diagram of LiH is constructed, which embodies rich physics in this previously-thought-simple ionic compound.</description>

Abstract: Shared micro-mobility such as e-scooters has gained significant popularity in many cities. However, existing methods for detecting community structures in mobility networks often overlook potential overlaps between communities. In this study, we conceptualize shared micro-mobility in urban spaces as a process of information exchange, where locations are connected through e-scooters, facilitating the interaction and propagation of community affiliations. As a result, similar locations are assigned the same label. Based on this concept, we developed a Geospatial Interaction Propagation model (GIP) by designing a Speaker-Listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA) that accounts for geographic distance decay, incorporating anomaly detection to ensure the derived community structures reflect meaningful spatial patterns. We applied this model to detect overlapping communities within the e-scooter system in Washington, D.C. The results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing model of overlapping community detection in both efficiency and modularity.

      <title>Band gap renormalization, carrier mobility and transport in Mg2Si and Ca2Si: Ab-initio scattering and Boltzmann transport equation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform first-principles electron-phonon interaction (EPI) calculations based on many-body perturbation theory to study the temperature-dependent band-gap and charge-carrier transport properties for Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si using the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under different relaxation-time approximations (RTAs). For a PBE band gap of 0.21 (0.56) eV in Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si), a zero-point renormalization correction of 29-33 (37-51) meV is obtained using various approaches, while the gap at 300 K is 0.15-0.154 (0.46-0.5) eV. The electron mobility ($\mu_{e}$), with a detailed convergence study at 300 K, is evaluated using linearized (self-energy and momentum RTA, or SERTA and MRTA) and iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions. At 300 K, the $\mu_{e}$ values are 351 (100), 573 (197), and 524 (163) cm$^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$ from SERTA, MRTA, and IBTE, respectively, for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si). SERTA (MRTA) provides results in better agreement with IBTE at higher (lower) temperatures, while SERTA-derived $\mu_{e}$ closely matches experimental $\mu_{e}$ values for Mg$_{2}$Si. Thermoelectric (TE) transport coefficients significantly influenced by the choice of RTA, with SERTA and MRTA yielding improved agreement with experimental results compared to constant RTA (CRTA) for Mg$_{2}$Si over an electron concentration range of $10^{17}$ to $10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. The lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{ph}$) at 300 K due to phonon-phonon interactions is estimated to be 22.7 (7.2) W m$^{-1}K^{-1}$ for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si). The highest calculated figure of merit (zT) under CRTA is 0.35 (0.38), which decreases to 0.08 (0.085) when EPI is included using MRTA. This study clearly identifies the critical role of EPI in accurate transport predictions of TE silicides. Finally, we explore strategies to enhance zT by reducing $\kappa_{ph}$ through nanostructuring and mass-difference scattering.</description>

      <title>Single-shot capable surface acoustic wave dispersion measurement of a layered plate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Established techniques for characterizing a layer on a substrate system via surface acoustic wave (SAW) dispersion measurement are often slow due to the need for scanning excitation or detection positions. We present a method for determining discrete points on the SAW mode at equidistant wavenumbers that requires only a single measurement, overcoming these speed limitations. A pulsed laser, shaped into an array of equidistant lines, generates elastic waves on the sample surface. A vibrometer detects the resulting surface displacement next to the line array. The periodic excitation arrangement results in constructive interference of the SAW at wavelengths corresponding to integer fractions of the line spacing. This leads to distinct peaks in the response spectrum, whose higher orders we term spatial harmonics of the SAW. The known line spacing determines the wavelengths, allowing the peak frequencies to be mapped to discrete points on the SAW dispersion curve, effectively sampling the SAW at specific equidistant wavenumbers. By solving an inverse problem, a model can be fit to the experimental data to obtain properties of the layered system. We demonstrate this technique on copper-clad epoxy laminate and roll-cladded aluminum alloy plates and compare our results with dispersion relation scans and micrography. Additionally, we analyze the method's sensitivity to elastic parameters and layer thickness. This approach offers a viable alternative to established SAW scanning methods, particularly in scenarios where the trade-off of lower wavenumber sampling density is acceptable to achieve exceptionally fast measurements while avoiding moving parts.</description>

      <title>A non-history dependent temporal superposition algorithm for the finite line source solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of the operation of fields of borehole heat exchangers involve a wide spectrum of time scales, and hourly simulations for decades are required for the evaluation of the heat transfer in the subsurface due to these systems. Most current models rely on time and space superposition of fundamental analytical solutions of the heat equation to build the solution for complex borehole fields configurations and loading conditions. These procedures are robust and accurate but do not have favorable scaling properties, and the problems can become quickly computationally intractable as the size increases. In this context, acceleration algorithms for temporal superposition are key to overcome this limitation. This paper presents developments on the so-called "non-history dependent" acceleration scheme and its application to the point and line source solutions, which are commonly used as building blocks in borehole field simulations.
  The results obtained show promising properties as the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear in the number of time steps, and near double precision accuracy can be achieved by refining the discretizations used to compute the integrals arising from the scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of radio-frequency (RF) signals is crucial for applications in robotics, traffic control, and medical devices. Spintronic devices, which respond to RF signals via ferromagnetic resonance, offer a promising solution. Recent studies have shown that a neural network of nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions can classify RF signals without digitization. However, the complexity of these junctions poses challenges for rapid scaling. In this work, we demonstrate that simple spintronic devices, known as metallic spin-diodes, can effectively perform RF classification. These devices consist of NiFe/Pt bilayers and can implement weighted sums of RF inputs. We experimentally show that chains of four spin-diodes can execute 2x2 pixel filters, achieving high-quality convolutions on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Integrating the hardware spin-diodes in a software network, we achieve a top-1 accuracy of 88 \% on the first 100 images, compared to 88.4 \% for full software with noise, and 90 \% without noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations of holes in GaN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GaN has emerged to be a major semiconductor akin to silicon due to its revolutionary impacts in solid state lighting, critically enabled by p-type doping, and high-performance radio-frequency and power electronics. Suffering from inefficient hole doping and low hole mobility, quantum oscillations in p-type GaN have not been observed, hindering fundamental studies of valence bands and hole transport in GaN. Here, we present the first observation of quantum oscillations of holes in GaN. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations in hole resistivity are observed in a quantum-confined two-dimensional hole gas at a GaN/AlN interface, where polarization-induced doping overcomes thermal freeze-out, and a sharp and clean interface boosts the hole mobility enough to unmask the quantum oscillations. These holes degenerately occupy the light and heavy hole bands of GaN and have record-high mobilities of ~1900 cm2/Vs and ~400 cm2/Vs at 3K, respectively. We use magnetic fields up to 72 T to resolve SdH oscillations of holes from both valence bands to extract their respective sheet densities, quantum scattering times, and the effective masses of light holes (0.5-0.7 m0) and heavy holes (1.9 m0). SdH oscillations of heavy and light holes in GaN constitute a direct metrology of valence bands and open new venues for quantum engineering in this technologically important semiconductor. Like strained silicon transistors, strain-engineering of the valence bands of GaN is predicted to dramatically improve hole mobilities by reducing the hole effective mass, a proposal that can now be explored experimentally, particularly in a fully fabricated transistor, using quantum oscillations. Furthermore, the findings of this work suggest a blueprint to create 2D hole gases and observe quantum oscillations of holes in related wide bandgap semiconductors such as SiC and ZnO in which such techniques are not yet possible.</description>

      <title>Multiple equilibrium states of a curved-sided hexagram: Part I-Stability of states</title>

Abstract: The stability of the multiple equilibrium states of a hexagram ring with six curved sides is investigated. Each of the six segments is a rod having the same length and uniform natural curvature. These rods are bent uniformly in the plane of the hexagram into equal arcs of 120deg or 240deg and joined at a cusp where their ends meet to form a 1-loop planar ring. The 1-loop rings formed from 120deg or 240deg arcs are inversions of one another and they, in turn, can be folded into a 3-loop straight line configuration or a 3-loop ring with each loop in an "8" shape. Each of these four equilibrium states has a uniform bending moment. Two additional intriguing planar shapes, 6-circle hexagrams, with equilibrium states that are also uniform bending, are identified and analyzed for stability. Stability is lost when the natural curvature falls outside the upper and lower limits in the form of a bifurcation mode involving coupled out-of-plane deflection and torsion of the rod segments. Conditions for stability, or lack thereof, depend on the geometry of the rod cross-section as well as its natural curvature. Rods with circular and rectangular cross-sections will be analyzed using a specialized form of Kirchhoff rod theory, and properties will be detailed such that all four of the states of interest are mutually stable. Experimental demonstrations of the various states and their stability are presented. Part II presents numerical simulations of transitions between states using both rod theory and a three-dimensional finite element formulation, includes confirmation of the stability limits established in Part I, and presents additional experimental demonstrations and verifications.</description>

      <title>Multiple equilibrium states of a curved-sided hexagram: Part II-Transitions between states</title>

Abstract: Curved-sided hexagrams with multiple equilibrium states have great potential in engineering applications such as foldable architectures, deployable aerospace structures, and shape-morphing soft robots. In Part I, the classical stability criterion based on energy variation was used to study the elastic stability of the curved-sided hexagram and identify the natural curvature range for stability of each state for circular and rectangular rod cross-sections. Here, we combine a multi-segment Kirchhoff rod model, finite element simulations, and experiments to investigate the transitions between four basic equilibrium states of the curved-sided hexagram. The four equilibrium states, namely the star hexagram, the daisy hexagram, the 3-loop line, and the 3-loop "8", carry uniform bending moments in their initial states, and the magnitudes of these moments depend on the natural curvatures and their initial curvatures. Transitions between these equilibrium states are triggered by applying bending loads at their corners or edges. It is found that transitions between the stable equilibrium states of the curved-sided hexagram are influenced by both the natural curvature and the loading position. Within a specific natural curvature range, the star hexagram, the daisy hexagram, and the 3-loop "8" can transform among one another by bending at different positions. Based on these findings, we identify the natural curvature range and loading conditions to achieve transition among these three equilibrium states plus a folded 3-loop line state for one specific ring having a rectangular cross-section. The results obtained in this part also validate the elastic stability range of the four equilibrium states of the curved-sided hexagram in Part I. We envision that the present work could provide a new perspective for the design of multi-functional deployable and foldable structures.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting thin-film electronics are attractive for their low power consumption, fast operating speeds, and ease of interface with cryogenic systems such as single-photon detector arrays, and quantum computing devices. However, the lack of a reliable superconducting two-terminal asymmetric device, analogous to a semiconducting diode, limits the development of power-handling circuits, fundamental for scaling up these technologies. Existing efforts to date have been limited to single-diode proofs of principle and lacked integration of multiple controllable and reproducible devices to form complex circuits. Here, we demonstrate a robust superconducting diode with tunable polarity using the asymmetric vortex surface barrier in niobium nitride micro-bridges, achieving a 43% peak rectification efficiency, and showing half-wave rectification up to 120 MHz. We then realize and integrate several such diodes into a bridge rectifier circuit on a single microchip that performs continuous full-wave rectification up to 3 MHz and AC-to-DC conversion in burst mode at 50 MHz with an estimated peak power efficiency of 50%.</description>

Abstract: Dry synthesis is a highly versatile method for the fabrication of nanoporous metal films, since it enables easy and reproducible deposition of single or multi-layer(s) of nanostructured materials that can find intriguing applications in plasmonics, photochemistry and photocatalysis, to name a few. Here, we extend the use of this methodology to the preparation of copper nanoislands that represent an affordable and versatile example of disordered plasmonic substrate. We perform detailed characterizations of the system using several techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry, cathodoluminescence, electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy and second-harmonic generation with the aim to investigate the optical properties of these systems in an unprecedented systematic way. Our study represents the starting point for future applications of this new disordered plasmonic system ranging from sensing to photochemistry and photocatalysis.</description>

Abstract: The von-Neumann bottleneck has constrained computing systems from efficiently operating on the increasingly large demand in data from networks and devices. Silicon (Si) photonics offers a powerful solution for this issue by providing a platform for high-bandwidth, energy-efficient interconnects. Furthermore, memristors have emerged as a fundamental building block for non-volatile data storage and novel computing architectures with powerful in-memory processing capabilities. In this paper, we integrate an Al2O3 memristor into a heterogeneous Si quantum dot microring laser to demonstrate the first laser with non-volatile optical memory. The memristor alters the effective optical modal index of the microring laser cavity by the plasma dispersion effect in the high resistance state (HRS) or Joule heating in the low resistance state (LRS), subsequently controlling the output wavelength of the laser in a non-volatile manner. This device enables a novel pathway for future optoelectronic neuromorphic computers and optical memory chips.</description>

      <title>Order parameters and phase transitions of continual learning in deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables animals to learn new tasks without erasing prior knowledge. CL in artificial neural networks (NNs) is challenging due to catastrophic forgetting, where new learning degrades performance on older tasks. While various techniques exist to mitigate forgetting, theoretical insights into when and why CL fails in NNs are lacking. Here, we present a statistical-mechanics theory of CL in deep, wide NNs, which characterizes the network's input-output mapping as it learns a sequence of tasks. It gives rise to order parameters (OPs) that capture how task relations and network architecture influence forgetting and anterograde interference, as verified by numerical evaluations. For networks with a shared readout for all tasks (single-head CL), the relevant-feature and rule similarity between tasks, respectively measured by two OPs, are sufficient to predict a wide range of CL behaviors. In addition, the theory predicts that increasing the network depth can effectively reduce interference between tasks, thereby lowering forgetting. For networks with task-specific readouts (multi-head CL), the theory identifies a phase transition where CL performance shifts dramatically as tasks become less similar, as measured by another task-similarity OP. While forgetting is relatively mild compared to single-head CL across all tasks, sufficiently low similarity leads to catastrophic anterograde interference, where the network retains old tasks perfectly but completely fails to generalize new learning. Our results delineate important factors affecting CL performance and suggest strategies for mitigating forgetting.</description>

      <title>All-optical compact setup for generation of collimated multi-MeV proton beams with a "snail" target</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work considers an optical scheme for collimation of high-energy proton beams using $\sim 10^5$~T scale magnetic fields induced in a miniature "snail" target by petawatt or multi-petawatt laser irradiation in ps or fs regime. Such magnetic fields are known to be frozen into hot plasma and exist on at least a hundred of picoseconds time-scale, allowing their use for control of charged particle beams. The high values of the magnetic field along with the compact size perfectly match conditions for an all-in-one optical setup, where first, the laser beam accelerates protons, by, e.g. Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, and second, the closely positioned snail target is driven to guide the proton beam. An important issue is that the laser drivers for both proton acceleration schemes and the magnetic field generation in the considered targets may have the same properties, and even be parts of one splitted beam. Numerical simulations show that the considered setup can be used for efficient collimation of $\simeq 100$~MeV protons. The collimation effect weakly depends on the fine magnetic field structure and can be observed both for a simple magneto-dipole field profile and for a more complex coaxial-like profiles accounting for the intricate structure of electric currents in the interaction region. The obtained results are interesting for the development of intense laser-driven sources of charged particle beams with low divergence and high energy of accelerated particles.</description>

Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW (known as wiggle well) and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by empirical nonlocal pseudopotential theory to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature with a focus on wiggle well type structures and compare our results with previous work. Our framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional microwave-optical conversion with an integrated soft-ferroelectric barium titanate transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth transduction between optical and microwave photons is key to long-range quantum communication between distant superconducting quantum processors. Recent demonstrations of microwave-optical transduction using the broadband direct electro-optic (Pockels) effect in optical thin films made of AlN or LiNbO$_3$ have shown promise. To improve efficiency and added noise, materials with larger Pockels coefficients, such as the soft ferroelectrics BaTiO$_3$ or SrTiO$_3$, are required. However, these materials require adapted designs and fabrication approaches due to their nonlinear and, in some cases, hysteretic electro-optic response. Here, we engineer an on-chip, triply resonant transducer comprising low-loss BaTiO$_3$-on-SiO$_2$ waveguides monolithically integrated with a superconducting microwave resonator made of Nb. We demonstrate bidirectional microwave-optical transduction and reach total off-chip efficiencies of $1\times10^{-6}$ using pulsed pumping. Our novel device concept permits in-situ poling of the ferroelectric material without introducing excess microwave loss, using a fully subtractive fabrication process with superconducting air bridges. In addition, we investigate optically induced heating, revealing fast thermalization and quasiparticle resilience of the microwave resonator. Our transducer concept and fabrication process are applicable to other materials with a large bias-induced Pockels effect and pave the way for efficient, low-power quantum interconnects.</description>
