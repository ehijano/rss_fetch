      <title>A high-efficiency plug-and-play superconducting qubit network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular architectures are a promising approach to scale quantum devices to the point of fault tolerance and utility. Modularity is particularly appealing for superconducting qubits, as monolithically manufactured devices are limited in both system size and quality. Constructing complex quantum systems as networks of interchangeable modules can overcome this challenge through `Lego-like' assembly, reconfiguration, and expansion, in a spirit similar to modern classical computers. First prototypical superconducting quantum device networks have been demonstrated. Interfaces that simultaneously permit interchangeability and high-fidelity operations remain a crucial challenge, however. Here, we demonstrate a high-efficiency interconnect based on a detachable cable between superconducting qubit devices. We overcome the inevitable loss in a detachable connection through a fast pump scheme, enabling inter-module SWAP efficiencies at the 99%-level in less than 100 ns. We use this scheme to generate high-fidelity entanglement and operate a distributed logical dual-rail qubit. At the observed ~1% error rate, operations through the interconnect are at the threshold for fault-tolerance. These results introduce a modular architecture for scaling quantum processors with reconfigurable and expandable networks.</description>

      <title>Classical Many-Worlds Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a simple baby-steps reconstruction of quantum mechanics as a fully classical theory. The most radical conceptual leap required is that there are many coexisting classical worlds, but even this is justified by the necessity of objective probabilities. These baby steps lead to a version of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics with built-in probabilities, built-in classicality at the macroscopic level, and an explanation of the complex numbers in quantum mechanics. Despite its simplicity and minimalism of radical concepts, this is not a toy model, being equivalent with quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Quantum Amplitude Estimation without QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put forward a Quantum Amplitude Estimation algorithm delivering superior performance (lower quantum computational complexity and faster classical computation parts) compared to the approaches available to-date. The algorithm does not relay on the Quantum Fourier Transform and its quantum computational complexity is of order $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ in terms of the target accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$. The $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ bound on quantum computational complexity is also superior compared to those in the earlier approaches due to smaller constants. Moreover, a much tighter bound is obtained by means of computer-assisted estimates for the expected value of quantum computational complexity. The correctness of the algorithm and the $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ bound on quantum computational complexity are supported by precise proofs.</description>

      <title>Qudit Quantum Programming with Projective Cliffords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel abstraction for programming quantum operations, specifically projective Cliffords, as functions over the qudit Pauli group. We define a categorical semantics for projective Cliffords based on Pauli encodings in terms of $\mathbb{Z}_d$-linear maps. We then introduce a type system and lambda calculus for both $\mathbb{Z}_d$-linear maps and projective Cliffords, and prove that these type systems have a sound denotational semantics in terms of the relevant categories. Finally, we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and programming constructions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Constacyclic BCH Codes over Qudits: A Spectral-Domain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize constacyclic codes in the spectral domain using the finite field Fourier transform (FFFT) and propose a reduced complexity method for the spectral-domain decoder. Further, we also consider repeated-root constacyclic codes and characterize them in terms of symmetric and asymmetric $q$-cyclotomic cosets. Using zero sets of classical self-orthogonal and dual-containing codes, we derive quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) for both constacyclic Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes and repeated-root constacyclic codes. We provide some examples of QECCs derived from repeated-root constacyclic codes and show that constacyclic BCH codes are more efficient than repeated-root constacyclic codes. Finally, quantum encoders and decoders are also proposed in the transform domain for Calderbank-Shor-Steane CSS-based quantum codes. Since constacyclic codes are a generalization of cyclic codes with better minimum distance than cyclic codes with the same code parameters, the proposed results are practically useful.</description>

      <title>Automated modal analysis of entanglement with bipartite self-configuring optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a unique feature of quantum mechanics. In coupled systems of light and matter, entanglement manifests itself in the linear superposition of multipartite quantum states (e.g., parametrized by the multiple spatial, spectral, or temporal degrees of freedom of a light field). In bipartite systems, the Schmidt decomposition provides a modal decomposition of the entanglement structure over independent, separable states. Although ubiquitous as a tool to describe and measure entanglement, there exists no general method to decompose a bipartite quantum state onto its Schmidt modes. Here, we propose a method that relies on bipartite self-configuring optics that automatically "learns" the Schmidt decomposition of an arbitrary pure quantum state. Our method is agnostic to the degrees of freedom over which quantum entanglement is distributed and can reconstruct the Schmidt modes and values by variational optimization of the network's output powers or coincidences. We illustrate our method with numerical examples of spectral entanglement analysis for biphotons generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion and provide experimental guidelines for its realization, including the influence of losses and impurities. Our method provides a versatile and scalable way of analyzing entanglement in bipartite integrated quantum photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems -- A brief introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This text is a short introduction to the physics of driven-dissipative many-body systems, focusing on a few selected topics. Beyond its more ``historical'' interest in the study of atomic physics and quantum optics, presently the modeling and studying dissipative phenomena in open quantum systems is pivotal to understanding quantum hardware platforms. While the lack of a thermodynamic potential for these out-of-equilibrium open systems makes it theoretically challenging to investigate their physics, at the same time it allows going beyond the thermodynamic paradigms and investigating new and exotic phenomena. We will focus on one of the simplest, yet most effective, descriptions of open quantum systems, namely the (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-) Lindblad master equation. This phenomenological approach describes quantum systems that weakly interact with their surrounding environment. Although many of the results derived below will apply to any quantum system, we will focus in particular on bosonic/spin systems.</description>

      <title>Achieving Heisenberg scaling by probe-ancilla interaction in quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heisenberg scaling is an ultimate precision limit of parameter estimation allowed by the principles of quantum mechanics, with no counterpart in the classical realm, and has been a long-pursued goal in quantum metrology. It has been known that interactions between the probes can help reach the Heisenberg scaling without entanglement. In this work, we show that interactions between the probes and the additional dimensions of an ancillary system may also increase the precision of parameter estimation to surpass the standard quantum limit and attain the Heisenberg scaling without entanglement, if the measurement scheme is properly designed. The quantum Fisher information exhibits periodic patterns over the evolution time, implying the existence of optimal time points for measurements that can maximize the quantum Fisher information. By implementing optimizations over the Hamiltonian, the initial states of the probes and the ancillary system, the interaction strength and the time points for measurements, our protocol achieves the Heisenberg scaling for the parameter of the probe Hamiltonian, in terms of both evolution time and probe number. Our protocol features in two aspects: (i) the Heisenberg scaling can be achieved by a product state of the probes, (ii) mere local measurement on the ancilla is sufficient, both of which reduce the quantum resources and the implementation complexity to achieve the Heisenberg scaling.</description>

      <title>Three-Photon Polarization Entanglement of Green Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, great progress has been made in the entanglement of multiple photons at various wavelengths and in different degrees of freedom for optical quantum information applied in diverse scenarios. However, multi-photon entanglement in the transmission window of green light under the water has not been reported yet. Here, by combining femtosecond laser based multi-photon entanglement and entanglement-maintaining frequency upconversion techniques, we successfully generate a green two-photon polarization-entangled Bell state and a green three-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, whose state fidelities are 0.893$\mathbf{\pm}$0.002 and 0.595$\mathbf{\pm}$0.023, respectively. Our result provides a scalable method to prepare green multi-photon entanglement, which may have wide applications in underwater quantum information.</description>

      <title>Continuously Expanding the Response Frequency of Rydberg Atom-Based Microwave Sensor by Using Quantum Mixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave electric (MW) field measurements utilizing Rydberg atoms have witnessed significant advancements, achieving remarkable sensitivity, albeit limited to discrete MW frequencies resonant with Rydberg states. Recently, various continuous-frequency measurement schemes have emerged. However, when the MW detuning surpasses 1 GHz, the sensitivity degrades by over an order of magnitude compared to resonant measurements. In this paper, we successfully extend the response frequency range by harnessing a controlled driving field in conjunction with a quantum mixer and heterodyne technology, theoretically enabling infinite scalability. Notably, second-order effects stemming from quantum mixing necessitate careful consideration to ensure accurate electric field measurements. In addition, compared to resonant measurements, the sensitivity decline for far-detuned MW fields exceeding 1 GHz is less than twice, representing a significant improvement of several orders of magnitude over alternative schemes. Furthermore, the sensitivity of far-detuned MW fields can be efficiently enhanced by augmenting the intensity and frequency of the controlled field. For detunings ranging from 100 MHz to 2 GHz, we present optimal sensitivity values and the corresponding methods to achieve them. Our findings pave the way for Rydberg atom-based MW receivers characterized by both high sensitivity and an exceptionally broad bandwidth.</description>

      <title>A Sufficient Criterion for Divisibility of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple, dimension-independent criterion which guarantees that some quantum channel $\Phi$ is divisible, i.e.~that there exists a non-trivial factorization $\Phi=\Phi_1\Phi_2$. The idea is to first define an "elementary" channel $\Phi_2$ and then to analyze when $\Phi\Phi_2^{-1}$ is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way -- which even yields an explicit factorization of $\Phi$ -- is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors $x,x^\perp$ such that $\langle x^\perp|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\langle x|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\{0\}$ where $\mathcal K_\Phi$ is the Kraus subspace of $\Phi$ and $\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp$ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application -- if possible -- results in a factorization of $\Phi$ into in some sense "simple" channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-guided optimization in quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an optimization algorithm to improve the design and performance of quantum communication networks. When physical architectures become too complex for analytical methods, numerical simulation becomes essential to study quantum network behavior. Although highly informative, these simulations involve complex numerical functions without known analytical forms, making traditional optimization techniques that assume continuity, differentiability, or convexity inapplicable. Additionally, quantum network simulations are computationally demanding, rendering global approaches like Simulated Annealing or genetic algorithms,
  which require extensive function evaluations, impractical. We introduce a more efficient optimization workflow using machine learning models, which serve as surrogates for a given objective function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three well-known optimization problems in quantum networking: quantum memory allocation for multiple network nodes, tuning an experimental parameter in all physical links of a quantum entanglement switch, and finding efficient protocol settings within a large asymmetric quantum network. The solutions found by our algorithm consistently outperform those obtained with our baseline approaches -- Simulated Annealing and Bayesian optimization -- in the allotted time limit by up to 18\% and 20\%, respectively. Our framework thus allows for more comprehensive quantum network studies, integrating surrogate-assisted optimization with existing quantum network simulators.</description>

      <title>Extending Schmidt vector from pure to mixed states for characterizing entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we enhance the understanding of entanglement transformations and their quantification by extending the concept of Schmidt vector from pure to mixed bipartite states, exploiting the lattice structure of majorization. The Schmidt vector of a bipartite mixed state is defined using two distinct methods: as a concave roof extension of Schmidt vectors of pure states, or equivalently, from the set of pure states that can be transformed into the mixed state through local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We demonstrate that the Schmidt vector fully characterizes separable and maximally entangled states. Furthermore, we prove that the Schmidt vector is monotonic and strongly monotonic under LOCC, giving necessary conditions for conversions between mixed states. Additionally, we extend the definition of the Schmidt rank from pure states to mixed states as the cardinality of the support of the Schmidt vector and show that it is equal to the Schmidt number introduced in previous work [Phys. Rev. A 61, 040301 (R), 2000]. Finally, we introduce a family of entanglement monotones by considering concave and symmetric functions applied to the Schmidt vector.</description>

      <title>The Questionable Influence of Entanglement in Quantum Optimisation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is promising compared to other quantum algorithms, but also depends significantly on the appropriate design of the underlying quantum circuit. Recent research by Bowles, Ahmend \&amp; Schuld, 2024 [1] raises questions about the effectiveness of entanglement in circuits for quantum machine learning algorithms. In our paper we want to address questions about the effectiveness of state preparation via Hadamard gates and entanglement via CNOT gates in the realm of quantum optimisation. We have constructed a total of eight different circuits, varying in implementation details, solving a total of 100 randomly generated MaxCut problems. Our results show no improvement with Hadamard gates applied at the beginning of the circuits. Furthermore, also entanglement shows no positive effect on the solution quality in our small scale experiments. In contrast, the investigated circuits that used entanglement generally showed lower, as well as deteriorating results when the number of circuit layers is increased. Based on our results, we hypothesise that entanglement can play a coordinating role, such that changes in individual parameters are distributed across multiple qubits in quantum circuits, but that this positive effect can quickly be overdosed and turned negative. The verification of this hypothesis represents a challenge for future research and can have a considerable influence on the development of new hybrid algorithms.</description>

      <title>Solving The Travelling Salesman Problem Using A Single Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a popular NP-hard-combinatorial optimization problem that requires finding the optimal way for a salesman to travel through different cities once and return to the initial city. The existing methods of solving TSPs on quantum systems are either gate-based or binary variable-based encoding. Both approaches are resource-expensive in terms of the number of qubits while performing worse compared to existing classical algorithms even for small-size problems. We present an algorithm that solves an arbitrary TSP using a single qubit by invoking the principle of quantum parallelism. The cities are represented as quantum states on the Bloch sphere while the preparation of superposition states allows us to traverse multiple paths at once. The underlying framework of our algorithm is a quantum version of the classical Brachistochrone approach. Optimal control methods are employed to create a selective superposition of the quantum states to find the shortest route of a given TSP. The numerical simulations solve a sample of four to nine cities for which exact solutions are obtained. The algorithm can be implemented on any quantum platform capable of efficiently rotating a qubit and allowing state tomography measurements. For the TSP problem sizes considered in this work, our algorithm is more resource-efficient and accurate than existing quantum algorithms with the potential for scalability. A potential speed-up of polynomial time over classical algorithms is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present a calculation scheme for bit-flip error rates in dissipative cat qubits due to various perturbations, by developing second-order perturbation theory on top of a non-linear dissipative Lindbladian. Following this scheme we derive an analytical expression for the exponentially small bit-flip rate due to single photon loss, which shows good agreement with numerical simulations. We also apply our scheme to other perturbations, such as frequency detuning and Z gate, and find the corresponding bit-flip rates.</description>

      <title>Route-Forcing: Scalable Quantum Circuit Mapping for Scalable Quantum Computing Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to scale in size to close the gap that currently exists between quantum algorithms and quantum hardware. To this end, quantum compilation techniques must scale along with the hardware constraints, shifting the current paradigm of obtaining an optimal compilation to relying on heuristics that allow for a fast solution, even though the quality of such a solution may not be optimal. Significant concerns arise as the execution time of current mapping techniques experiences a notable increase when applied to quantum computers with a high number of qubits. In this work, we present Route-Forcing, a quantum circuit mapping algorithm that shows an average speedup of $3.7\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art scalable techniques, reducing the depth of the mapped circuit by $4.7 \times$ at the expense of adding $1.3 \times$ more SWAP gates. Moreover, the proposed mapping algorithm is adapted and tuned for what is expected to be the next generation of quantum computers, in which different processors are interconnected to increase the total number of qubits, allowing for more complex computations.</description>

      <title>Photonic "hourglass" design beyond the standard bulk model of phonon decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of mechanical vibrations on the performance of the photonic "hourglass" structure, which is predicted to emit single photons on-demand with near-unity efficiency and indistinguishability. Previous investigations neglected the impact of vibrational modes inherent to this quasi-1D geometry, relying instead on a three-dimensional bulk assumption for the phonon modes. However, it has been shown that phonon decoherence has a much stronger impact in 1D structures as compared with bulk media. Here, we surprisingly demonstrate the robustness of the photonic hourglass design, achieving close-to-unity indistinguishability even by incorporating a detailed description of the vibrational modes. We explain this unexpected result in terms of the large Purcell enhancement of the hourglass single-photon source, which eliminates the negative effect of phonons. Our findings highlight the key role of high-Q optical cavities in mitigating the detrimental effect of phonon decoherence, even for structures of reduced dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on Near-term Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a noise-aware distributed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) tailored for execution on near-term quantum hardware. Leveraging a distributed framework, we address the limitations of current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are hindered by limited qubit counts and high error rates. Our approach decomposes large QAOA problems into smaller subproblems, distributing them across multiple Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) to enhance scalability and performance. The noise-aware strategy incorporates error mitigation techniques to optimize qubit fidelity and gate operations, ensuring reliable quantum computations. We evaluate the efficacy of our framework using the HamilToniQ Benchmarking Toolkit, which quantifies the performance across various quantum hardware configurations. The results demonstrate that our distributed QAOA framework achieves significant improvements in computational speed and accuracy, showcasing its potential to solve complex optimization problems efficiently in the NISQ era. This work sets the stage for advanced algorithmic strategies and practical quantum system enhancements, contributing to the broader goal of achieving quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlocal modulation cancellation with distributed clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate nonlocal modulation of entangled photons with truly distributed RF clocks. Leveraging a custom radio-over-fiber (RFoF) system characterized via classical spectral interference, we validate its effectiveness for quantum networking by multiplexing the RFoF clock with one photon from a frequency-bin-entangled pair and distributing the coexisting quantum-classical signals over fiber. Phase modulation of the two photons reveals nonlocal correlations in excellent agreement with theory: in-phase modulation produces additional sidebands in the joint spectral intensity, while out-of-phase modulation is nonlocally canceled. Our simple, feedback-free design attains sub-picosecond synchronization -- namely, drift less than $\sim$0.5 ps in a 5.5 km fiber over 30 min (fractionally only $\sim$2$\times$10$^{-8}$ of the total fiber delay) -- and should facilitate frequency-encoded quantum networking protocols such as high-dimensional quantum key distribution and entanglement swapping, unlocking frequency-bin qubits for practical quantum communications in deployed metropolitan-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Speeding up quantum measurement using space-time trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme for speeding up quantum measurement. The scheme builds on previous protocols that entangle the system to be measured with ancillary systems. In the idealised situation of perfect entangling operations and no decoherence, it gives an exact space-time trade-off meaning the readout time reduces linearly with the number of ancilla. We verify this scheme is robust against experimental imperfections through numerical modelling of gate noise and readout errors, and under certain circumstances our scheme can even lead to better than linear improvement in the speed of measurement with the number of systems measured. This hardware-agnostic approach is broadly applicable to a range of quantum technology platforms and offers a route to accelerate mid-circuit measurement as required for effective quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Spatially multiplexed single-photon sources based on binary-tree multiplexers with optimized structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for optimizing the structure of general binary-tree multiplexers realized with asymmetric photon routers aiming at improving the performance of spatially multiplexed single-photon sources. Our procedure systematically considers all possible binary-tree multiplexers that can be formed by a certain number of photon routers. Using this method one can select the multiplexer structure that leads to the highest single-photon probability for a given set of loss parameters characterizing the system. We determine the optimal general binary-tree multiplexers for experimentally realizable values of the transmission coefficients of the photon routers and that of the detector efficiency. We show that single-photon sources based on such optimal multiplexers yield higher single-photon probabilities than that can be achieved with single-photon sources based on any other spatial multiplexer considered in the literature. Our approach improves the performance of multiplexed single-photon sources even for small system sizes which is the typical situation in current experiments.</description>

      <title>A quantum analog of Huygen's clock: noise-induced synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum analogue of the Huygens clock, in which the phases of two spins achieve synchronization through their interaction with a shared environment. The environment functions analogously to the escapement mechanism in a mechanical clock, regulating the gear train and permitting the advancement of timing in discrete intervals. In our proposed model, the relative phase of the two spins become synchronized through interaction with a mutual, correlated, environment. We show that for a system of qubits, several arguments can be made that significantly reduce the cardinality of the set of allowed measurements and, hence, the complexity of the problem. We present a numerically efficient method to calculate the degree of quantumness that exists in the correlations of our final density matrix. This method also provides a tight upper bound for when the system is described by rank-3 and rank-4 density matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks and quantum computation are two of the most powerful tools for the simulation of quantum many-body systems. Rather than viewing them as competing approaches, here we consider how these two methods can work in tandem. We introduce a novel algorithm that combines tensor networks and quantum computation to produce results that are more accurate than what could be achieved by either method used in isolation. Our algorithm is based on multiproduct formulas (MPF) - a technique that linearly combines Trotter product formulas to reduce algorithmic error. Our algorithm uses a quantum computer to calculate the expectation values and tensor networks to calculate the coefficients used in the linear combination. We present a detailed error analysis of the algorithm and demonstrate the full workflow on a one-dimensional quantum simulation problem on $50$ qubits using two IBM quantum computers: $ibm\_torino$ and $ibm\_kyiv$.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of High $E_J/E_C$ transmon qudits up to $d = 12$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qudits provide a resource-efficient alternative to qubits for quantum information processing. The multilevel nature of the transmon, with its individually resolvable transition frequencies, makes it an attractive platform for superconducting circuit-based qudits. In this work, we systematically analyze the trade-offs associated with encoding high-dimensional quantum information in fixed-frequency transmons. Designing high $E_J/E_C$ ratios of up to 325, we observe up to 12 levels ($d=12$) on a single transmon. Despite the decreased anharmonicity, we demonstrate process infidelities $e_f &lt; 3 \times 10^{-3}$ for qubit-like operations in each adjacent-level qubit subspace in the lowest 10 levels. Furthermore, we achieve a 10-state readout assignment fidelity of 93.8% with the assistance of deep neural network classification of a multi-tone dispersive measurement. We find that the Hahn echo time $T_{2E}$ for the higher levels is close to the limit of $T_1$ decay, primarily limited by bosonic enhancement. We verify the recently introduced Josephson harmonics model, finding that it yields better predictions for the transition frequencies and charge dispersion. Finally, we show strong $ZZ$-like coupling between the higher energy levels in a two-transmon system. Our high-fidelity control and readout methods, in combination with our comprehensive characterization of the transmon model, suggest that the high-$E_J/E_C$ transmon is a powerful tool for exploring excited states in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Full Qubit Control in the NV$^-$ Ground State for Low Field or High Frequency Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme for the implementation of fast arbitrary qubit gates in the ground state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^-$) defect in diamond. The protocol is especially useful in the low-field regime and for high-frequency sensing applications. It constitutes an extension to the NV-ERC technique, which has demonstrated efficient initialization and readout of the double quantum transition with no leakage to any third level thanks to an effective Raman coupling. Here we derive a full theoretical framework of the scheme, identifying the complete unitary associated to the approach, and more specifically the relevant basis change for each of two characteristic pulse durations. Based on this insight, we propose a scheme to perform fast qubit transformations in the double quantum transition. We study its robustness with respect to pulse-timing errors resulting from faulty identification of system parameters or phase-control limitations. We finally demonstrate that the technique can also be implemented in the presence of unknown electric or strain fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1-form symmetry, manifesting as loop-like symmetries, has gained prominence in the study of quantum phases, deepening our understanding of symmetry. However, the role of 1-form symmetries in Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS), two-dimensional tensor network states, remains largely underexplored. We present a novel framework for understanding 1-form symmetries within tensor networks, specifically focusing on the derivation of algebraic relations for symmetry matrices on the PEPS virtual legs. Our results reveal that 1-form symmetries impose stringent constraints on tensor network representations, leading to distinct anomalous braiding phases carried by symmetry matrices. We demonstrate how these symmetries influence the ground state and tangent space in PEPS, providing new insights into their physical implications for enhancing ground state optimization efficiency and characterizing the 1-form symmetry structure in excited states.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence in neutrino spin-flavor oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherence, which represents the superposition of orthogonal states, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and can also be precisely defined within quantum resource theory. Thus exploring quantum coherence in neutrino oscillations can not only help in examining the intrinsic quantum nature but can also explore their potential applications in quantum information technologies. Previous studies on quantum coherence have focused on neutrino flavor oscillations (FO). However, FO imply that neutrinos have mass and this can lead to the generation of a tiny but finite magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos through quantum loop diagrams at higher orders of perturbative expansion of the interaction. This electromagnetic property of neutrinos can induce spin flavor oscillations (SFO) in the presence of an external magnetic field and hence is expected to enrich the study of coherence. In this work, we investigate quantum coherence in neutrino SFO with three flavor mixing within the interstellar as well as intergalactic magnetic fields, quantified by the $l_1$ norm and the relative entropy of coherence, and express these measures in terms of neutrino SFO probabilities. For FO, coherence measures can sustain higher values (say, within 50% of the maximum) over distances of several kilometers, which are relevant for terrestrial experiments like reactor and accelerator neutrinos. However, for SFO, we find that the coherence scale can extend to astrophysical distances, spanning from kiloparsecs to gigaparsecs.</description>

Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic quantum many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>New design paradigm for highly efficient and low noise photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high quantum efficiency (QE) with low dark count is essential for highly sensitive photodetectors (PDs), including single photon avalanche detectors (SPADs). However, high QE requires a thicker absorber region, which leads to high dark current and noise, which in turn affects the detectivity of PDs and the photodetection efficiency and dark count of SPADs.The holy grail of photodetector and avalanche photodiode designs is to achieve highest QE with thinnest absorber and still enable large avalanche to gain as needed. We have developed a new design paradigm which exploits the coupling between dielectric Mie resonance and transverse propagating waves in thin layers. The Mie resonance launches the incident light at an angle in an ultrathin absorber, and when coupled to transverse waves, the light propagates laterally and is fully absorbed owing to the longer optical path. Consequently, with appropriate choice of materials for a chosen wavelength, a high absorption(~90%) within typically &lt;100 nm absorber thickness is possible. For illustration, we apply our approach to design Si-based detector operating at 810 nm and InGaAs-based detector operating at 1550 nm and predict that the dark current at room temperature is reduced at least by two orders of magnitude. In addition, the lateral distances are often in a few microns and hence these designs can potentially enable avalanching for a large optical gain.</description>

      <title>Studying Critical Parameters of Superconductor via Diamond Quantum Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical parameters are the key to superconductivity research, and reliable instrumentations can facilitate the study. Traditionally, one has to use several different measurement techniques to measure critical parameters separately. In this work, we develop the use of a single species of quantum sensor to determine and estimate several critical parameters with the help of independent simulation data. We utilize the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in the diamond, which recently emerged as a promising candidate for probing exotic features in condensed matter physics. The non-invasive and highly stable nature provides extraordinary opportunities to solve scientific problems in various systems. Using a high-quality single-crystalline YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{4}$O$_{8}$ (YBCO) as a platform, we demonstrate the use of diamond particles and a bulk diamond to probe the Meissner effect. The evolution of the vector magnetic field, the $H-T$ phase diagram, and the map of fluorescence contour are studied via NV sensing. Our results reveal different critical parameters, including lower critical field $H_{c1}$, upper critical field $H_{c2}$, and critical current density $j_{c}$, as well as verifying the unconventional nature of this high-temperature superconductor YBCO. Therefore, NV-based quantum sensing techniques have huge potential in condensed matter research.</description>

      <title>Feedback Intensity Equalization for Multi-Spots Holographic Tweezer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the high degree of adjustability, holographic tweezer array has been proved to be the best choice to create arbitrary geometries atomic array. In holographic tweezer array experiment, optical tweezer generated by spatial light modulator (SLM) usually is used as static tweezer array. Due to the alternating current(AC) stark shifts effect, intensity difference of traps will cause different light shift. So, the optimization of intensity equalization is very important in many-body system consist of single atoms. Here we report a work on studying of intensity equalization algorithm. Through this algorithm, the uniformity of tweezer can exceed 96% when the number of tweezer size is bigger than 1000. Our analysis shows that further uniformity requires further optimization of optical system. The realization of the intensity equalization algorithm is of great significance to the many-body experiments based on single atom array.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at both infinite and finite temperature, aligning with results from spectral statistics and OTOCs. Our findings offer a new diagnostic tool for quantum chaos that is operator-independent, potentially leading to more `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of general properties in quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Quanv4EO: Empowering Earth Observation by means of Quanvolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant amount of remotely sensed data is generated daily by many Earth observation (EO) spaceborne and airborne sensors over different countries of our planet. Different applications use those data, such as natural hazard monitoring, global climate change, urban planning, and more. Many challenges are brought by the use of these big data in the context of remote sensing applications. In recent years, employment of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based algorithms have allowed a more efficient use of these data but the issues in managing, processing, and efficiently exploiting them have even increased since classical computers have reached their limits. This article highlights a significant shift towards leveraging quantum computing techniques in processing large volumes of remote sensing data. The proposed Quanv4EO model introduces a quanvolution method for preprocessing multi-dimensional EO data. First its effectiveness is demonstrated through image classification tasks on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, and later on, its capabilities on remote sensing image classification and filtering are shown. Key findings suggest that the proposed model not only maintains high precision in image classification but also shows improvements of around 5\% in EO use cases compared to classical approaches. Moreover, the proposed framework stands out for its reduced parameter size and the absence of training quantum kernels, enabling better scalability for processing massive datasets. These advancements underscore the promising potential of quantum computing in addressing the limitations of classical algorithms in remote sensing applications, offering a more efficient and effective alternative for image data classification and analysis.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have positioned it as a prospective solution for tackling intricate computational challenges, with supervised learning emerging as a promising domain for its application. Despite this potential, the field of quantum machine learning is still in its early stages, and there persists a level of skepticism regarding a possible near-term quantum advantage. This paper aims to provide a classical perspective on current quantum algorithms for supervised learning, effectively bridging traditional machine learning principles with advancements in quantum machine learning. Specifically, this study charts a research trajectory that diverges from the predominant focus of quantum machine learning literature, originating from the prerequisites of classical methodologies and elucidating the potential impact of quantum approaches. Through this exploration, our objective is to deepen the understanding of the convergence between classical and quantum methods, thereby laying the groundwork for future advancements in both domains and fostering the involvement of classical practitioners in the field of quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Within its range of applicability, the Boltzmann equation seems unique in its capacity to accurately describe the transition from almost any initial state to a self-equilibrated thermal state. Using information-theoretic methods to rephrase the key idea of Maxwell and Boltzmann, the Sto{\ss}zahlansatz, a far more general, abstract ansatz is developed. An increase of the Gibbs-Shannon-von Neumann entropy results without the usual coarse-graining. The mathematical structure of the ansatz also provides avenues for efficient computation and simulation.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Harvesting Vacuum Entanglement in Cosmic String Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the entanglement generation in a pair of qubits that experience the vacuum fluctuations of a scalar field in the Cosmic String spacetime. The qubits are modeled as Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. We introduce a Heisenberg $XY$-interaction between the qubits that enhances the generation of quantum correlations. It is supposed that the qubits begin at a general mixed state described by a density operator with no entanglement while the field stays at its vacuum state. In this way, we find the general properties and conditions to create entanglement between the qubits by exploiting the field vacuum fluctuations. We quantify the qubits entanglement using the Negativity measure based on the Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion. We find that the Cosmic String would increase the entanglement harvesting when both qubits are near the Cosmic String. When the qubits locations are far from the Cosmic String we recover the usual results for Minkowski space. The Heisenberg $XY$-interaction enhance the entanglement harvesting irrespective of the coupling nature (ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic). When the qubits are far apart from each other we find a maximum entanglement harvesting at the resonance points between the Heisenberg coupling constant and the qubits energy gap.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of orientation averages and its application to molecular physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular physics, it is often necessary to average over the orientation of molecules when calculating observables, in particular when modelling experiments in the liquid or gas phase. Evaluated in terms of Euler angles, this is closely related to integration over two- or three-dimensional unit spheres, a common problem discussed in numerical analysis. The computational cost of the integration depends significantly on the quadrature method, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial for the feasibility of simulations. After reviewing several classes of spherical quadrature methods in terms of their efficiency and error distribution, we derive guidelines for choosing the best quadrature method for orientation averages and illustrate these with three examples from chiral molecule physics. While Gauss quadratures allow for achieving numerically exact integration for a wide range of applications, other methods offer advantages in specific circumstances. Our guidelines can also by applied to higher-dimensional spherical domains and other geometries. We also present a Python package providing a flexible interface to a variety of quadrature methods.</description>

Abstract: Simulation of the Hubbard model is a leading candidate for the first useful applications of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A recent study of quantum algorithms for early simulations of the Hubbard model [Kivlichan \textit{et al.} Quantum 4 296 (2019)] found that the lowest resource costs were achieved by split-operator Trotterization combined with the fast-fermionic Fourier transform (FFFT) on an $L \times L$ lattice with length $L=2^k$. On lattices with length $L \neq 2^k$, Givens rotations can be used instead of the FFFT but lead to considerably higher resource costs. We present a new analytic approach to bounding the simulation error due to Trotterization that provides much tighter bounds for the split-operator FFFT method, leading to $16 \times$ improvement in error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce plaquette Trotterization that works on any size lattice and apply our improved error bound analysis to show competitive resource costs. We consider a phase estimation task and show plaquette Trotterization reduces the number of non-Clifford gates by a factor $5.5\times$ to $9 \times$ (depending on the parameter regime) over the best previous estimates for $8 \times 8$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices and a much larger factor for other lattice sizes not of the form $L=2^k$. In conclusion, we find there is a potentially useful application for fault-tolerant quantum computers using around one million Toffoli gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a design of a quantum battery exploiting the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian as a charger. In particular, starting with the ground or the thermal state of the interacting (non-interacting) Hamiltonian as the battery, the charging of the battery is performed via parity-time (PT)- and rotational-time (RT)-symmetric Hamiltonian to store energy. We report that such a quenching with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian leads to an enhanced power output compared to a battery with a Hermitian charger. We identify the region in the parameter space which provides the gain in performance. We also demonstrate that the improvements persist with the increase of system size for batteries with both PT- and RT-symmetric chargers. In the PT-symmetric case, although the anisotropy of the XY model does not help in the performance, we show that the XXZ model as a battery with a non-Hermitian charger performs better than that of the XX model having certain interaction strengths. We also exhibit that the advantage of non-Hermiticity remains valid even at finite temperatures in the initial states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum long-range extended Ising model possesses several striking features that cannot be observed in the corresponding short-range model. We report that the pattern obtained from the entanglement between any two arbitrary sites of the long-range model can be mimicked by the model having a finite range of interactions provided the interaction strength is moderate. On the other hand, we illustrate that when the interactions are strong, the entanglement distribution in the long-range model does not match the class of a model with a few interactions. We also show that the monogamy score of entanglement is in good agreement with the behavior of pairwise entanglement. Specifically, it saturates when the entanglement in the finite-range Hamiltonian behaves similarly to the long-range model, while it decays algebraically otherwise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the revitalized interest in the digital simulation of medium- and high-energy physics phenomena, we investigate the dynamics following a Yukawa-interaction quench on IBM Q. Adopting the zero-dimensional version of the scalar Yukawa-coupling model as our point of departure, we design low-depth quantum circuits emulating its dynamics with up to three bosons. In the one-boson case we demonstrate circuit compression, i.e., a constant-depth circuit containing only two controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. In the more complex three-boson case, we design a circuit in which one Trotter step entails $8$ CNOTs. Using an analogy with the traveling-salesman problem, we also provide a CNOT-cost estimate for higher boson-number truncations. Based on these circuits, we quantify the system dynamics by evaluating the expected boson number at an arbitrary time after the quench and the survival probability of the initial vacuum state (the Loschmidt echo). We also utilize these circuits to drive adiabatic transitions and compute the energies of the ground- and first-excited states of the considered model. Finally, through error mitigation -- i.e, zero-noise extrapolation -- we demonstrate a good agreement of our results with a numerically-exact classical benchmark.</description>

      <title>Averaging gate approximation error and performance of Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz in Pre-FTQC Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is essential to implement quantum algorithms in a noise-resilient way, and thus to enjoy advantages of quantum computers even with presence of noise. In FTQC, a quantum circuit is decomposed into universal gates that can be fault-tolerantly implemented, for example, Clifford+$T$ gates. Here, $T$ gate is usually regarded as an essential resource for quantum computation because its action cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers and it is experimentally difficult to implement fault-tolerantly. Practically, it is highly likely that only a limited number of $T$ gates are available in the near future. Pre-FTQC era, due to the constraint on available resources, it is vital to precisely estimate the decomposition error of a whole circuit. In this paper, we propose that the Clifford+$T$ decomposition error for a given quantum circuit containing a large number of quantum gates can be modeled as the depolarizing noise by averaging the decomposition error for each quantum gate in the circuit, and our model provides more accurate error estimation than the naive estimation. We exemplify this by taking unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz used in the applications of quantum computers to quantum chemistry as an example. We theoretically evaluate the approximation error of UCC ansatz when decomposed into Clifford+$T$ gates, and the numerical simulation for a wide variety of molecules verified that our model well explains the total decomposition error of the ansatz. Our results enable the precise and efficient usage of quantum resources in the early-stage applications of quantum computers and fuel further research towards what quantum computation can achieve in the upcoming future.</description>

Abstract: Given some group $G$ of logical gates, for instance the Clifford group, what are the quantum encodings for which these logical gates can be implemented by simple physical operations, described by some physical representation of $G$? We study this question by constructing a general form of such encoding maps. For instance, we recover that the $[[5,1,3]]$ and Steane codes admit transversal implementations of the binary tetrahedral and binary octahedral groups, respectively. For bosonic encodings, we show how to obtain the GKP and cat qudit encodings by considering the appropriate groups, and essentially the simplest physical implementations. We further illustrate this approach by introducing a 2-mode bosonic code defined from a constellation of 48 coherent states, for which all single-qubit Clifford gates correspond to passive Gaussian unitaries.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir probing: an inverse paradigm of quantum reservoir computing for exploring quantum many-body physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00898v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a brain-inspired computational paradigm, exploiting natural dynamics of a quantum system for information processing. To date, a multitude of quantum systems have been utilized in the QRC, with diverse computational capabilities demonstrated accordingly. This study proposes a reciprocal research direction: probing quantum systems themselves through their information processing performance in the QRC framework. Building upon this concept, here we develop quantum reservoir probing (QRP), an inverse extension of the QRC. The QRP establishes an operator-level linkage between physical properties and performance in computing. A systematic scan of this correspondence reveals intrinsic quantum dynamics of the reservoir system from computational and informational perspectives. Unifying quantum information and quantum matter, the QRP holds great promise as a potent tool for exploring various aspects of quantum many-body physics. In this study, we specifically apply it to analyze information propagation in a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We demonstrate that the QRP not only distinguishes between ballistic and diffusive information propagation, reflecting the system's dynamical characteristics, but also identifies system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over conventional methods.</description>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms have the ability to reduce runtime for executing tasks beyond the capabilities of classical algorithms. Therefore, identifying the resources responsible for quantum advantages is an interesting endeavour. We prove that nonvanishing quantum correlations, both bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement, are required for solving nontrivial linear systems of equations in the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm. Moreover, we find a nonvanishing l1-norm quantum coherence of the entire system and the register qubit which turns out to be related to the success probability of the algorithm. Quantitative analysis of the quantum resources reveals that while a significant amount of bipartite entanglement is generated in each step and required for this algorithm, multipartite entanglement content is inversely proportional to the performance indicator. In addition, we report that when imperfections chosen from Gaussian distribution are incorporated in controlled rotations, multipartite entanglement increases with the strength of the disorder, albeit error also increases while bipartite entanglement and coherence decreases, confirming the beneficial role of bipartite entanglement and coherence in this algorithm.</description>

      <title>Improved Pairwise Measurement-Based Surface Code</title>

Abstract: We devise a new realization of the surface code on a rectangular lattice of qubits utilizing single-qubit and nearest-neighbor two-qubit Pauli measurements and three auxiliary qubits per plaquette. This realization gains substantial advantages over prior pairwise measurement-based realizations of the surface code. It has a short operation period of 4 steps and our performance analysis for a standard circuit noise model yields a high fault-tolerance threshold of approximately $0.66\% $. The syndrome extraction circuits avoid bidirectional hook errors, so we can achieve full code distance by choosing appropriate boundary conditions. We also construct variants of the syndrome extraction circuits that entirely prevent hook errors, at the cost of larger circuit depth. This achieves full distance regardless of boundary conditions, with only a modest decrease in the threshold. Furthermore, we propose an efficient strategy for dealing with dead components (qubits and measurements) in our surface code realization, which can be adopted more generally for other surface code realizations. This new surface code realization is highly optimized for Majorana-based hardware, accounting for constraints imposed by layouts and the implementation of measurements, making it competitive with the recently proposed Floquet codes.</description>

Abstract: Interference, which refers to the phenomenon associated with the superposition of waves, has played a crucial role in the advancement of physics and finds a wide range of applications in physical and engineering measurements. Interferometers are experimental setups designed to observe and manipulate interference. With the development of technology, many quantum interferometers have been discovered and have become cornerstone tools in the field of quantum physics. Quantum interferometers not only explore the nature of the quantum world but also have extensive applications in quantum information technology, such as quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum measurement. In this review, we analyze and summarize three typical quantum interferometers: the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, the N00N state interferometer, and the Franson interferometer. We focus on the principles and applications of these three interferometers. In the principles section, we present the theoretical models for these interferometers, including single-mode theory and multi-mode theory. In the applications section, we review the applications of these interferometers in quantum communication, computation, and measurement. We hope that this review article will promote the development of quantum interference in both fundamental science and practical engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We found that fluctuations in the number of emitters lead to a super-thermal photon statistics of small LEDs in a linear regime, with a strong emitter-field coupling and a bad cavity favorable for collective effects. A simple analytical expression for the second-order correlation function g_2 is found. g_2 increase up to g_2=6 in the two-level LED model is predicted. The super-thermal photon statistics is related to the population fluctuation increase of the spontaneous emission to the cavity mode.</description>

      <title>Readout error mitigated quantum state tomography tested on superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum technologies rely heavily on accurate control and reliable readout of quantum systems. Current experiments are limited by numerous sources of noise that can only be partially captured by simple analytical models and additional characterization of the noise sources is required. We test the ability of readout error mitigation to correct realistic noise found in systems composed of quantum two-level objects (qubits). To probe the limit of such methods, we designed a beyond-classical readout error mitigation protocol based on quantum state tomography (QST), which estimates the density matrix of a quantum system, and quantum detector tomography (QDT), which characterizes the measurement procedure. By treating readout error mitigation in the context of state tomography the method becomes largely readout mode-, architecture-, noise source-, and quantum state-independent. We implement this method on a superconducting qubit and evaluate the increase in reconstruction fidelity for QST. We characterize the performance of the method by varying important noise sources, such as suboptimal readout signal amplification, insufficient resonator photon population, off-resonant qubit drive, and effectively shortened $T_1$ and $T_2$ decay times. As a result, we identified noise sources for which readout error mitigation worked well, and observed decreases in readout infidelity by a factor of up to 30.</description>

      <title>Contextual Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver Calculation of the Dissociation Curve of Molecular Nitrogen on a Superconducting Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present an experimental demonstration of the Contextual Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver on superconducting quantum hardware. In particular, we compute the potential energy curve for molecular nitrogen, where a dominance of static correlation in the dissociation limit proves challenging for many conventional quantum chemistry techniques. Our quantum simulations retain good agreement with the full configuration interaction energy in the chosen STO-3G basis, outperforming all benchmarked single-reference wavefunction techniques in capturing the bond-breaking appropriately. Moreover, our methodology is competitive with several multiconfigurational approaches, but at a considerable saving of quantum resource, meaning larger active spaces can be treated for a fixed qubit allowance. To achieve this result we deploy an error mitigation/suppression strategy comprised of dynamical decoupling, measurement-error mitigation and zero-noise extrapolation, in addition to circuit parallelization that not only provides passive averaging of noise but improves the effective shot-yield to reduce the measurement overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a modification to previous adaptive ansatz construction algorithms that incorporates hardware-awareness into our variational circuits to minimize the transpilation cost for the target qubit topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraints on the quantum decoherence of entangled $\gamma$ quanta at the mega-electron-volt scale, such as those produced following positron annihilation, have remained elusive for many decades. We present the first statistically and kinematically precise experimental data for triple Compton scattering of such entangled $\gamma$. An entanglement witness ($R$), relating to the enhancement of the azimuthal correlation between the final scattering planes, is obtained where one of the $\gamma$ underwent intermediate Compton scattering. The measured $R$, deconvolved from multiple scattering backgrounds, are found to exceed the classical limit for intermediate scatter angles up to $\sim$60$^{\circ}$ and diminish at larger angles. The data are consistent with predictions from a first quantum theory of entangled triple Compton scattering as well as a simple model based approach. The results are crucial to future study and utilisation of entangled mega-electron-volt $\gamma$ in fundamental physics and PET imaging.</description>

Abstract: We present an open-source database of superconducting quantum device designs that may be used as the starting point for customized devices. Each design can be generated programmatically using the open-source Qiskit Metal package, and simulated using finite-element electromagnetic solvers. We present a robust workflow for achieving high accuracy on design simulations. Many designs in the database are experimentally validated, showing excellent agreement between simulated and measured parameters. Our database includes a front-end interface that allows users to generate ``best-guess'' designs based on desired circuit parameters. This project lowers the barrier to entry for research groups seeking to make a new class of devices by providing them a well-characterized starting point from which to refine their designs.</description>

Abstract: Realizing photonic graph states, crucial in various quantum protocols, is challenging due to the absence of deterministic entangling gates in linear optics. To address this, emitter qubits have been leveraged to establish and transfer the entanglement to photons. We introduce an optimization method for such protocols based on the local Clifford equivalency of states and the graph theoretical correlations of the generation cost parameters. Employing this method, we achieve a 50% reduction in use of the 2-qubit gates for generation of the arbitrary large repeater graph states and similar significant reductions in the total gate count for generation of random dense graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense potential for solving classically intractable problems by leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics. The scalability of quantum architectures remains a significant challenge. Multi-core quantum architectures are proposed to solve the scalability problem, arising a new set of challenges in hardware, communications and compilation, among others. One of these challenges is to adapt a quantum algorithm to fit within the different cores of the quantum computer. This paper presents a novel approach for circuit partitioning using Deep Reinforcement Learning, contributing to the advancement of both quantum computing and graph partitioning. This work is the first step in integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques into Quantum Circuit Mapping, opening the door to a new paradigm of solutions to such problems.</description>

Abstract: Information geometry is the application of differential geometry in statistics, where the Fisher-Rao metric serves as the Riemannian metric on the statistical manifold, providing an intrinsic property for parameter sensitivity. In this paper, we explore the Fisher-Rao metric with the non-Hermitian systems. By approximating the Lindblad master equation in the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we calculate the time evolution of the quantum geometric metric. Finally, we give an example of the quantum spin Ising model of the imaginary magnetic field, explore the energy spectrum of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian and the evolution of geometric metric, and discuss that the dissipative effect of the imaginary magnetic field can be eliminated under the condition of adding the control Hamiltonian, so as to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional topological effect in a transmon qubit array with tunable couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a square-lattice architecture of superconducting transmon qubits with inter-qubit interactions mediated by inductive couplers. Therein, the inductive couling between the qubit and couplers is suggested to be designed into the gradiometer form to intigimate the flux noise orginating from the environment. Via periodically modulating the couplers,the Abelian gauge potential, termed effective magnetic flux, can be synthesized artificially, making the system an excellent platform for simulating two-dimensional topological physics. In the simplest two-dimensional model, the double (or three-leg) ladder, the staggered vortex-Meissner phase transition different from that in the two-leg ladder can be found in the single-particle ground state as the effective magnetic flux varies. Besides, the large coupling ratio between the interleg and intraleg coupling strengths also makes the chiral current resemble squeezed sinusoidal functions. If the row number is further increased, the topological band structure anticipated at massive rows begins to occur even for a relatively small number of rows (ten or so for the considered parameters). This heralds a small circuit scale to observe the topological band. The edge state in the band gap is determined by the topological Chern number and can be calculated through integrating the Berry curvature with respect to the first Brillouin zone. Besides, we present a systematic method on how to measure the topological band structure based on time- and space-domain Frourier transformation of the wave function after properly excited. The result offers an avenue for simulating two-dimensional topological physics on the state-of-the-art superconducting quantum chips.</description>

      <title>The Unruh-DeWitt model and its joint interacting Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we make the connection between the Unruh-DeWitt particle detector model applied to quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and the rigorous construction of the spin-boson model. With some modifications, we show that existing results about the existence of a spin-boson ground state can be adapted to the Unruh-DeWitt model. In the most relevant scenario involving massless scalar fields in (3+1)-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes, where the Unruh-DeWitt model describes a simplified model of light-matter interaction, we argue that common choices of the spacetime smearing functions regulate the ultraviolet behaviour of the model but can still exhibit infrared divergences. In particular, this implies the well-known expectation that the joint interacting Hilbert space of the model cannot be described by the tensor product of a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space and the Fock space of the vacuum representation. We discuss the conditions under which this problem does not arise and the relevance of the operator-algebraic approach for better understanding of particle detector models and their applications. Our work clarifies the connection between obstructions due to Haag's theorem and infrared bosons in the spin-boson models, and paves the way for more rigorous study of entanglement and communication in the UDW framework involving multiple detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor. Optical atomic clocks, the current state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schr\"odinger cat states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up to 4 qubits. However, due to their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared to unentangled atoms. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermalization in closed non-integrable quantum systems using the Krylov basis. We demonstrate that for thermalization to occur, the matrix representation of typical local operators in the Krylov basis should exhibit a specific tridiagonal form with all other elements in the matrix are exponentially small, reminiscent of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.</description>

      <title>Twist-and-turn dynamics of spin squeezing in bosonic Josephson junctions: Enhanced shortcuts-to-adiabaticity approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twist-and-turn dynamics of spin squeezing result from the interplay of the one-axis-twisting- (nonlinear in the collective-spin operators) and the transverse-field turning (linear) term in the underlying Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick-type Hamiltonian, both with constant (time-independent) coupling strenghts. Using the methods of shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) and their recently developed enhanced version (eSTA), we demonstrate here that dynamics of this type can be utilized for a fast and robust preparation of spin-squeezed states in internal bosonic Josephson junctions -- condensates of cold bosonic atoms in two different internal (hyperfine) states (single-boson modes) coupled through Rabi rotations. Assuming that the initial state of this system is its ground state for a given initial value of the (time-dependent) linear-coupling strength and that the nonlinear-coupling strength remains constant, we set out to determine the time-dependence of the linear (Rabi) coupling strength that allows for the generation of spin-squeezed states using the STA- and eSTA-based approaches. We then characterize the modified twist-and-turn dynamics of this system by evaluating the coherent-spin-squeezing- and number-squeezing parameters, as well as the fidelity of the target spin-squeezed states. In this way, we show that the eSTA approach allows for a particularly robust experimental realization of strongly spin-squeezed states in this system, consistently outperforming its adiabatic and STA-based counterparts, even for systems with several hundred particles.</description>

      <title>QUACK: Quantum Aligned Centroid Kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) seems to show potential for application in machine learning (ML). In particular quantum kernel methods (QKM) exhibit promising properties for use in supervised ML tasks. However, a major disadvantage of kernel methods is their unfavorable quadratic scaling with the number of training samples. Together with the limits imposed by currently available quantum hardware (NISQ devices) with their low qubit coherence times, small number of qubits, and high error rates, the use of QC in ML at an industrially relevant scale is currently impossible. As a small step in improving the potential applications of QKMs, we introduce QUACK, a quantum kernel algorithm whose time complexity scales linear with the number of samples during training, and independent of the number of training samples in the inference stage. In the training process, only the kernel entries for the samples and the centers of the classes are calculated, i.e. the maximum shape of the kernel for n samples and c classes is (n, c). During training, the parameters of the quantum kernel and the positions of the centroids are optimized iteratively. In the inference stage, for every new sample the circuit is only evaluated for every centroid, i.e. c times. We show that the QUACK algorithm nevertheless provides satisfactory results and can perform at a similar level as classical kernel methods with quadratic scaling during training. In addition, our (simulated) algorithm is able to handle high-dimensional datasets such as MNIST with 784 features without any dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted Rendezvous on Graphs: Explicit Algorithms and Quantum Computer Simulations</title>

Abstract: We study quantum advantage in one-step rendezvous games on simple graphs analytically, numerically, and using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors. Our protocols realise the recently discovered [arXiv:2207.14404] optimal bounds for small cycle graphs and cubic graphs. In the case of cycle graphs, we generalise the protocols to arbitrary graph size. The NISQ processor experiments realise the expected quantum advantage with high accuracy for rendezvous on the complete graph K3. In contrast, for the graph 2K4, formed by two disconnected 4-vertex complete graphs, the performance of the NISQ hardware is sub-classical, consistent with the deeper circuit and known qubit decoherence and gate error rates.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations on D-Wave's {\tt Advantage} Quantum Annealer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In extreme environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers, and the early Universe, neutrinos are dense enough that their self-interactions significantly affect, if not dominate, their flavor dynamics. In order to develop techniques for characterizing the resulting quantum entanglement, I present the results of simulations of Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions that include all three physical neutrino flavors and were performed on D-Wave Inc.'s {\tt Advantage} 5000+ qubit quantum annealer. These results are checked against those from exact classical simulations, which are also used to compare the Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions to neutrino-antineutrino and Majorana neutrino-neutrino interactions. The D-Wave {\tt Advantage} annealer is shown to be able to reproduce time evolution with the precision of a classical machine for small number of neutrinos and to do so without Trotter errors. However, it suffers from poor scaling in qubit-count with the number of neutrinos. Two approaches to improving the qubit-scaling are discussed, but only one of the two shows promise.</description>

      <title>Why quantum correlations are shocking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple minimalist argument is given for why some correlations between quantum systems boggle our classical intuition. The argument relies on two elementary physical assumptions, and recovers the standard experimentally-testable Bell inequality in a form that applies equally well to correlations between six-sided dice and between photon polarizations. The first assumption, that measurement selection in a first lab leaves the measurement statistics in a remote lab invariant (no-signaling), has been empirically verified, and is shown to be equivalent to the existence of a corresponding joint probability distribution for quantities measured in the first lab. The observed violation of the Bell inequality is then equivalent to the failure of a second assumption, that measurement selection in the remote lab leaves such a joint distribution invariant. Indeed, the degree of violation lower-bounds the variation of the joint distribution. It directly follows there are just three possible physical mechanisms underlying such violations -- action-at-a-distance (superluminality), unavoidable common factors linking measurement choice and distant properties (conspiracy), and intrinsically incompatible physical quantities (complementarity). The argument extends to all Bell inequalities, and is briefly compared with other derivations.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on quantum uncommon information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical information theory, channel capacity quantifies the maximum number of messages that can be reliably transmitted using shared information. An equivalent concept, termed uncommon information, represents the number of messages required to be exchanged to completely share all information in common. However, this equivalence does not extend to quantum information theory. Specifically, quantum uncommon information is operationally defined as the minimal amount of entanglement required for the quantum communication task of quantum state exchange, where two parties exchange quantum states to share all quantum messages in common. Currently, an analytical closed-form expression for the quantum uncommon information remains undetermined. In this work, by investigating underlying characterization of the quantum uncommon information, we derive improved bounds on it. To obtain these bounds, we develop a subspace exchange strategy that leverages a common subspace of two parties to identify the unnecessary qubits for exchange. We also consider a referee-assisted exchange, wherein a referee aids two parties in efficiently performing the quantum state exchange. Our bounds provide more precise estimations for the quantum uncommon information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the subspace technique is a versatile tool for characterizing uncommon information not only in the bipartite scenario but also in various multi-partite ones.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction suppresses noise in quantum systems to allow for high-precision computations. In this work, we introduce Multivariate Bicycle (MB) Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes, via an extension of the framework developed by Bravyi et al. [Nature, 627, 778-782 (2024)] and particularly focus on Trivariate Bicycle (TB) codes. Unlike the weight-6 codes proposed in their study, we offer concrete examples of weight-4 and weight-5 TB-QLDPC codes which promise to be more amenable to near-term experimental setups. We show that our TB-QLDPC codes up to weight-6 have a bi-planar structure. Further, most of our new codes can also be arranged in a two-dimensional toric layout, and have substantially better encoding rates than comparable surface codes while offering similar error suppression capabilities. For example, we can encode 4 logical qubits with distance 5 into 30 physical qubits with weight-5 check measurements, while a surface code with these parameters requires 100 physical qubits. The high encoding rate and compact layout make our codes highly suitable candidates for near-term hardware implementations, paving the way for a realizable quantum error correction protocol.</description>

      <title>An application of continuous-variable gate synthesis to quantum simulation of classical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although quantum computing holds promise to accelerate a wide range of computational tasks, the quantum simulation of quantum dynamics as originally envisaged by Feynman remains the most promising candidate for achieving quantum advantage. A less explored possibility with comparably far-reaching technological applicability is the quantum simulation of classical nonlinear dynamics. Attempts to develop digital quantum algorithms based on the Koopman von Neumann formalism have met with challenges because of the necessary projection step from an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space to the finite-dimensional subspace described by a collection of qubits. This finitization produces numerical artifacts that limit solutions to very short time horizons. In this paper we review continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), which naturally avoids such obstacles, and a CVQC algorithm for KvN simulation of classical nonlinear dynamics is advocated. In particular, we present explicit gate synthesis for product-formula Hamiltonian simulation of anharmonic vibrational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Experimental verifiable multi-client blind quantum computing on a Qline architecture</title>

Abstract: The exploitation of certification tools by end users represents a fundamental aspect of the development of quantum technologies as the hardware scales up beyond the regime of classical simulatability. Certifying quantum networks becomes even more crucial when the privacy of their users is exposed to malicious quantum nodes or servers as in the case of multi-client distributed blind quantum computing, where several clients delegate a joint private computation to remote quantum servers, such as federated quantum machine learning. In such protocols, security must be provided not only by keeping data hidden but also by verifying that the server is correctly performing the requested computation while minimizing the hardware assumptions on the employed devices. Notably, standard verification techniques fail in scenarios where the clients receive quantum states from untrusted sources such as, for example, in a recently demonstrated linear quantum network performing multi-client blind quantum computation. However, recent theoretical results provide techniques to verify blind quantum computations even in the case of untrusted state preparation. Equipped with such theoretical tools, in this work, we provide the first experimental implementation of a two-client verifiable blind quantum computing protocol in a distributed architecture. The obtained results represent novel perspectives for the verification of multi-tenant distributed quantum computation in large-scale networks.</description>

Abstract: Learning an unknown quantum process is a central task for validation of the functioning of near-term devices. The task is generally hard, requiring exponentially many measurements if no prior assumptions are made on the process. However, an interesting feature of the classically-simulable Clifford group is that unknown Clifford operations may be efficiently determined from a black-box implementation. We extend this result to the important class of fermionic Gaussian operations. These operations have received much attention due to their close links to fermionic linear optics. We then introduce an infinite family of unitary gates, called the Matchgate Hierarchy, with a similar structure to the Clifford Hierarchy. We show that the Clifford Hierarchy is contained within the Matchgate Hierarchy and how operations at any level of the hierarchy can be efficiently learned.</description>

      <title>A time-parallel multiple-shooting method for large-scale quantum optimal control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control plays a crucial role in quantum computing by providing the interface between compiler and hardware. Solving the optimal control problem is particularly challenging for multi-qubit gates, due to the exponential growth in computational complexity with the system's dimensionality and the deterioration of optimization convergence. To ameliorate the computational complexity of time-integration, this paper introduces a multiple-shooting approach in which the time domain is divided into multiple windows and the intermediate states at window boundaries are treated as additional optimization variables. This enables parallel computation of state evolution across time-windows, significantly accelerating objective function and gradient evaluations. Since the initial state matrix in each window is only guaranteed to be unitary upon convergence of the optimization algorithm, the conventional gate trace infidelity is replaced by a generalized infidelity that is convex for non-unitary state matrices. Continuity of the state across window boundaries is enforced by equality constraints. A quadratic penalty optimization method is used to solve the constrained optimal control problem, and an efficient adjoint technique is employed to calculate the gradients in each iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on quantum Fourier transform gates in systems with 2, 3, and 4 qubits, noting a speedup of 80x for evaluating the gradient in the 4-qubit case, highlighting the method's potential for optimizing control pulses in multi-qubit quantum systems.</description>

      <title>L2O-$g^{\dagger}$: Learning to Optimize Parameterized Quantum Circuits with Fubini-Study Metric Tensor</title>

Abstract: Before the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computers, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) play a crucial role in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines. Conventionally, the optimization of VQAs predominantly relies on manually designed optimizers. However, learning to optimize (L2O) demonstrates impressive performance by training small neural networks to replace handcrafted optimizers. In our work, we propose L2O-$g^{\dagger}$, a $\textit{quantum-aware}$ learned optimizer that leverages the Fubini-Study metric tensor ($g^{\dagger}$) and long short-term memory networks. We theoretically derive the update equation inspired by the lookahead optimizer and incorporate the quantum geometry of the optimization landscape in the learned optimizer to balance fast convergence and generalization. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments across a range of VQA problems. Our results demonstrate that L2O-$g^{\dagger}$ not only outperforms the current SOTA hand-designed optimizer without any hyperparameter tuning but also shows strong out-of-distribution generalization compared to previous L2O optimizers. We achieve this by training L2O-$g^{\dagger}$ on just a single generic PQC instance. Our novel $\textit{quantum-aware}$ learned optimizer, L2O-$g^{\dagger}$, presents an advancement in addressing the challenges of VQAs, making it a valuable tool in the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. Our approach demonstrates sparks of quantum advantage through faster training times compared to classical optimizers such as the Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experimental results on initial training of classification and regression tasks validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant speedups and comparable performance to classical methods. While experiments on retraining demonstrate a sixty times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be even larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks, widely used for providing efficient representations of low-energy states of local quantum many-body systems, have been recently proposed as machine learning architectures which could present advantages with respect to traditional ones. In this work we show that tensor network architectures have especially prospective properties for privacy-preserving machine learning, which is important in tasks such as the processing of medical records. First, we describe a new privacy vulnerability that is present in feedforward neural networks, illustrating it in synthetic and real-world datasets. Then, we develop well-defined conditions to guarantee robustness to such vulnerability, which involve the characterization of models equivalent under gauge symmetry. We rigorously prove that such conditions are satisfied by tensor-network architectures. In doing so, we define a novel canonical form for matrix product states, which has a high degree of regularity and fixes the residual gauge that is left in the canonical forms based on singular value decompositions. We supplement the analytical findings with practical examples where matrix product states are trained on datasets of medical records, which show large reductions on the probability of an attacker extracting information about the training dataset from the model's parameters. Given the growing expertise in training tensor-network architectures, these results imply that one may not have to be forced to make a choice between accuracy in prediction and ensuring the privacy of the information processed.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on Lorentz violation from composite-pulse Ramsey spectroscopy in a trapped ion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00570v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In attempts to unify the four known fundamental forces in a single quantum-consistent theory, it is suggested that Lorentz symmetry may be broken at the Planck scale. Here we search for Lorentz violation at the low-energy limit by comparing orthogonally oriented atomic orbitals in a Michelson-Morley-type experiment. We apply a robust radiofrequency composite pulse sequence in the $^2F_{7/2}$ manifold of an Yb$^+$ ion, extending the coherence time from 200 $\mu$s to more than 1 s. In this manner, we fully exploit the high intrinsic susceptibility of the $^2F_{7/2}$ state and take advantage of its exceptionally long lifetime. We match the stability of the previous best Lorentz symmetry test nearly an order of magnitude faster and improve the constraints on the symmetry breaking coefficients to the 10$^{-21}$ level. These results represent the most stringent test of this type of Lorentz violation. The demonstrated method can be further extended to ion Coulomb crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, with its superior computational capabilities compared to classical approaches, holds the potential to revolutionize numerous scientific domains, including pharmaceuticals. However, the application of quantum computing for drug discovery has primarily been limited to proof-of-concept studies, which often fail to capture the intricacies of real-world drug development challenges. In this study, we diverge from conventional investigations by developing \rev{a hybrid} quantum computing pipeline tailored to address genuine drug design problems. Our approach underscores the application of quantum computation in drug discovery and propels it towards more scalable system. We specifically construct our versatile quantum computing pipeline to address two critical tasks in drug discovery: the precise determination of Gibbs free energy profiles for prodrug activation involving covalent bond cleavage, and the accurate simulation of covalent bond interactions. This work serves as a pioneering effort in benchmarking quantum computing against veritable scenarios encountered in drug design, especially the covalent bonding issue present in both of the case studies, thereby transitioning from theoretical models to tangible applications. Our results demonstrate the potential of a quantum computing pipeline for integration into real world drug design workflows.</description>

      <title>Thawed Gaussian wave packet dynamics: a critical assessment of three propagation schemes</title>

Abstract: We assessed three schemes for propagating a variable-width (thawed) Gaussian wave packet moving under the influence of Morse or double-well potentials with parameters that are chemically representative. The most rigorous scheme is based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP); it leads to realistic behaviour of the center and width of a wave packet in all investigated regimes. Two other approximate schemes, Heller's and the extended semiclassical ones, demonstrate various aberrations. Heller's scheme does not properly account for various zero-point energy-related effects, is unable to predict tunneling, and more importantly, exhibits completely nonphysical unbound width oscillations. The extended semiclassical scheme, which was developed to address some of the shortcomings of the Heller counterpart, demonstrates another unphysical behaviour: self-trapping of a trajectory in both Morse and double-well potentials. We conclude that only the TDVP-based scheme is suitable for problem-free dynamical simulations. This, however, raises the question of how to utilize it efficiently in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions. Many studies have proven its accuracy in depicting atomic environments, although this comes with high computational needs. The computational burden of this challenge is hard to reduce due to the need for permutation equivariance, which limits the design space of the CG transform layer. We show that, implementing the CG transform layer on permutation-invariant inputs allows complete freedom in the design of this layer without affecting symmetry. Developing further on this premise, our idea is to create a CG transform layer that operates on permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We bring in group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and property prediction in QM9 datasets with notable enhancement. The extensibility to other models is also examined. Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out on MD17 and other periodic systems, including water and LiPS, showcasing the capacity for real-world applications of FreeCG. It introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>

      <title>Universality of Information Thermodynamics and the Efficiency of Information Erasure on the Cosmological Apparent Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the information loss at the cosmological apparent horizon in an expanding universe has a direct correspondence with the Landauer principle of information dynamics. We show that the Landauer limit is satisfied in this case, which implies that the information erasure at the cosmological apparent horizon happens in the most efficient way possible. We also show that our results hold for extensions of the standard entropy formulations. We also discuss about the connections this result provides between information loss at black holes and that at the cosmological apparent horizon, and we term the "Cosmological Information Paradox". This is the first work which directly provides a correspondence between information dynamics and expanding cosmic horizons, and we discuss several interesting implications of this result.</description>
