      <title>Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibirum physics of density-difference dependent Hamiltonian: Quantum Scarring from Emergent Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars represent a form of weak ergodicity breaking that highlights the unusual physics of thermalization in quantum systems. Understanding scar formation promises insight into the connection between classical statistical mechanics and the quantum world. The existence of quantum many-body scars calls into question how the macroscopic world can arise from the Schrodinger equation. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of quantum many-body scars in the density-difference-dependent Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian has a particular manifestation of chiral symmetry due to its interaction being neither attractive nor repulsive a prior, but depending on the configuration. As a result of this symmetry and peculiar interaction, we find that this system hosts two different classes of quantum scars; a charge density wave ordered scar and an edge-mode scar. We establish the existence of these scars by examining the entanglement entropy of the system as well as demonstrating robust thermalization breaking time dynamics. For each, we propose simple mechanisms that give rise to these scars which may be applicable to other systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity-mediated charge and pair-density waves in a unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent light-matter interactions between a quantum gas and light in a high-finesse cavity can drive self-ordering phase transitions. To date, such phenomena have involved exclusively single-atom coupling to light, resulting in coupled charge-density or spin-density wave and superradiant order. In this work, we engineer simultaneous coupling of cavity photons to both single atoms and fermionic pairs, which are also mutually coupled due to strong correlations in the unitary Fermi gas. This interplay gives rise to an interference between the charge-density wave and a pair-density wave, where the short-range pair correlation function is spontaneously modulated in space. We observe this effect by tracking the onset of superradiance as the photon-pair coupling is varied in strength and sign, revealing constructive or destructive interference of the three orders with a coupling mediated by strong light-matter and atom-atom interactions. Our observations are compared with mean-field theory where the coupling strength between atomic- and pair-density waves is controlled by higher-order correlations in the Fermi gas. These results demonstrate the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics to produce and observe exotic orders in strongly correlated matter, paving the way for the quantum simulation of complex quantum matter using ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Engineering of Feshbach Resonances in Ultracold Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering resonances are fundamental in science, spanning energy scales from stellar nuclear fusion to ultracold collisions. In ultracold quantum gases, magnetic Feshbach resonances have transformed quantum many-body research by enabling precise interaction control between atoms. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control to engineer new Feshbach resonances at tunable positions via Floquet driving in a $^{6}$Li atom gas, achieved through strong magnetic field modulation at MHz frequencies. This periodic modulation creates new resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating. This technique enhances control over atomic interactions, expanding possibilities for quantum simulations of complex systems and studies of exotic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum gas microscopy of three-flavor Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hubbard systems are paradigmatic realizations of strongly correlated many-body systems. Introducing additional species breaks the SU(2) symmetry of the Hubbard model and leads to a wide variety of novel exotic quantum phases. Three-component fermionic systems are at the heart of model systems for quantum chromodynamics where the three components reflect the three flavors. Here, we extend quantum gas microscopy to three-flavor Fermi lattice gases in the Hubbard regime. Relying on site- and flavor-resolved detection, we study the phase diagram of the three-flavor Hubbard model and find signatures of flavor-selective localization and selective pairing at temperatures down to the tunneling energy scale. Our measurements are compared with numerical linked-cluster expansion calculations. Further increase of phase space density may enable the observation of a novel pair Mott phase at half filling, and shows a path towards the study of color superfluidity and other aspects of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Studying the radiation of a white dwarf star falling onto a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11525v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate electromagnetic and gravitational radiation generated during the process of the tidal stripping of a white dwarf star circulating a black hole. We go beyond Chandrasekhar's ideas and not only consider a white dwarf itself as a quantum object, but also describe the dynamics of a produced accretion disk in a quantum way. We model the white dwarf star as a Bose-Fermi droplet and use the quantum hydrodynamic equations to simulate the evolution of the black hole-white dwarf binary system. While going through the periastron, the white dwarf loses a small fraction of its mass. The mass falling onto a black hole is a source of powerful electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Bursts of ultraluminous radiation are flared at each periastron passage. This resembles the recurrent flaring of X-ray sources discovered recently by Irwin et al. Gravitational energy bursts occur mainly through emission at very low frequencies. The accretion disk, formed due to stripping of the white dwarf, starts at some point to contribute continuously to radiation of both electromagnetic and gravitational types.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <title>Tunable Two-Species Spin Models with Rydberg Atoms in Circular and Elliptical States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.</description>

      <title>Induced three-neutron interactions with low cutoffs for dilute neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of dilute neutron matter are mostly determined by the s-wave two-body (2N) interaction, while three-body (3N) interactions are suppressed by the Pauli principle. In a previous work, we showed that it can be advantageous to use renormalization group based effective interactions with cutoffs scaled with the Fermi momentum, especially at low densities. In that case, induced 3N interactions may become important. In this work, we compute the 3N interaction induced by the similarity renormalization group flow of the s-wave 2N interaction. We work in the momentum-space hyperspherical partial wave basis and investigate its convergence properties. Then we study the effect of the induced 3N interaction on the equation of state of dilute neutron matter. We observe that the cutoff dependence of the equation of state is strongly reduced when the effect of induced 3N interaction is included.</description>
