      <title>Characterization Of MOSS For The ALICE ITS3 For The LHC Run 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ALICE, one of the four main CERN LHC experiments, studies heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. For LHC Run 4 (starting 2030), ALICE will replace the three innermost cylindrical layers of its inner tracking system during Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2029). The new ITS3 will enhance pointing resolution by a factor of two and improve tracking efficiency at low transverse momentum (pT &lt; 0.3 GeV/c). It will feature ultra-thin (&lt; 50 micrometer), stitched wafer-scale Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) using 65 nm CMOS imaging technology. These sensors can be bent, forming a truly cylindrical barrel with an innermost radius of 19 mm and an average material budget of 0.09 X/X0 per layer. ITS3 development involves cutting-edge R&amp;D, including MAPS production in 65 nm CMOS, stitched wafer-scale fabrication, ultra-light mechanics, and a novel air cooling system. The 65 nm CMOS technology was validated using Multi-Layer Reticle 1 test structures. In mid-2023, the first stitched prototypes, MOnolithic Stitched Sensors (MOSS), were produced to demonstrate stitching feasibility and assess wafer-scale sensor yield and performance. Each MOSS chip (1.4 cm x 25.9 cm) contains 6.7 million pixels across 10 repeated sensor units, each with 8 pixel matrices: top matrices (256 x 256 pixels, 22.5 micrometer pitch) and bottom matrices (320 x 320 pixels, 18 micrometer pitch). These layouts help evaluate yield variations based on density and spacing. This work presents results from MOSS characterization, including power domain impedance, DAC performance, pixel readout, threshold, and fake-hit rate scans. Beam and lab tests confirmed an efficiency &gt;99% and a Fake Hit Rate lower than 0.1 pixel-1 s-1, meeting ITS3 requirements for Run 4.</description>

      <title>Effect of Light Nuclei on Chemical Freeze-out Parameters at RHIC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the chemical freeze-out of hadrons, including light-and strange-flavor particles and light nuclei, produced in Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), was investigated. Using the thermal-FIST thermodynamic statistical model, we analyzed various particle sets: those inclusive of light nuclei, those exclusive to light nuclei, and those solely comprising light nuclei. We determined the chemical freeze-out parameters at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=$ 7.7--200 GeV and four different centralities. A significant finding was the decrease in the chemical freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ with light nuclei inclusion, with an even more pronounced reduction when considering light nuclei yields exclusively. This suggests that light nuclei formation occurs at a later stage in the system's evolution at RHIC energies. We present parameterized formulas that describe the energy dependence of $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ and the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ for three distinct particle sets in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies. Our results reveal at least three distinct $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ at RHIC energies correspond to different freeze-out hypersurfaces: a light-flavor freeze-out temperature of $T_L$ = 150.2$\pm$6 MeV, a strange-flavor freeze-out temperature $T_s$ = 165.1$\pm$2.7 MeV, and a light-nuclei freeze-out temperature $T_{\textrm{ln}}$ = 141.7$\pm$1.4 MeV. Notably, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Pb+Pb 2.76 TeV, the expected lower freeze-out temperature for light nuclei was not observed; instead, the $T_{\textrm{ch}}$ for light nuclei was found to be approximately 10 MeV higher than that for light-flavor hadrons.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity study of a sapphire detector using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment(ICNSE) has been proposed at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering process using electron antineutrinos produced from reactors. Phenomenological studies are performed to find out the sensitivity of sapphire detector for various fundamental physics parameters at an exposure of one year. Reactors of different core compositions, sizes, and thermal powers have been considered as sources of electron antineutrinos. The potential of the ICNSE to measure the weak mixing angle at a low energy regime has been extracted. Furthermore, the detector's capability has been investigated for examining the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, including their magnetic moment. Additionally, an exploration has been conducted on the detector's sensitivity in restricting new interactions between neutrinos and electrons or nuclei, thereby constraining the parameter space related to light mediators. It is found that the ICNSE detector can put a stronger constraints on the scalar and vector mediators masses.</description>

      <title>Performance Characteristics of the Battery-Operated Si PIN Diode Detector with Integrated Preamplifier and Data Acquisition Module for Fusion Particle Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the performance and application of a commercial off-the shelf Si PIN diode (Hamamatsu S14605) as a charged particle detector in a compact ion beam system (IBS) capable of generating D-D and p-B fusion charged particles. This detector is inexpensive, widely available, and operates in photoconductive mode under a reverse bias voltage of 12 V, supplied by an A23 battery. A charge-sensitive preamplifier (CSP) is powered by two 3 V lithium batteries (A123), providing +/-3 V rail voltages. Both the detector and preamplifier circuits are integrated onto the same 4-layer PCB and housed on the vacuum side of the IBS, facing the fusion target. The system employs a CF-2.75 flanged DB-9 connector feedthrough to supply the signal, bias voltage, and rail voltages. To mitigate the high sensitivity of the detector to optical light, a thin aluminum foil assembly is used to block optical emissions from the ion beam and target. Charged particles generate step responses on the preamplifier output, with pulse rise times on the order of 0.2 to 0.3 us. These signals are recorded using a custom-built data acquisition unit, which features an optical fiber data link to ensure electrical isolation of the detector electronics. Subsequent digital signal processing is employed to optimally shape the pulses using a CR-RC^4 filter to produce Gaussian-shaped signals, enabling accurate extraction of energy information. Performance results show that the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) for D-D fusion charged particles - protons, tritons, and helions - are approximately 30, 10, and 5, respectively, with a shaping time constant of 4 us.</description>
