      <title>TelecomRAG: Taming Telecom Standards with Retrieval Augmented Generation and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have immense potential to transform the telecommunications industry. They could help professionals understand complex standards, generate code, and accelerate development. However, traditional LLMs struggle with the precision and source verification essential for telecom work. To address this, specialized LLM-based solutions tailored to telecommunication standards are needed. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a way to create precise, fact-based answers. This paper proposes TelecomRAG, a framework for a Telecommunication Standards Assistant that provides accurate, detailed, and verifiable responses. Our implementation, using a knowledge base built from 3GPP Release 16 and Release 18 specification documents, demonstrates how this assistant surpasses generic LLMs, offering superior accuracy, technical depth, and verifiability, and thus significant value to the telecommunications field.</description>

      <title>Edge Rendering Architecture for multiuser XR Experiences and E2E Performance Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic communications are gaining ground among emerging eXtended-Reality (XR) applications due to their potential to revolutionize human communication. However, these technologies are characterized by higher requirements in terms of Quality of Service (QoS), such as high transmission data rates, very low latency, and high computation capacity, challenging current achievable capabilities. In this context, computation offloading techniques are being investigated, where resource-intensive computational tasks, like rendering XR experiences, are shifted from user devices to a separate processor, specifically an Edge Computing instance. This paper introduces an Edge Rendering architecture for multiuser XR experiences, implements it on top of widely employed XR and Web technologies, and proposes a method based on image and audio processing to evaluate its performance in terms of end-to-end media streaming latency, inter-device, and intra-media synchronization when employing different access networks.</description>

      <title>EdgeTimer: Adaptive Multi-Timescale Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mobile edge computing (MEC), resource scheduling is crucial to task requests' performance and service providers' cost, involving multi-layer heterogeneous scheduling decisions. Existing schedulers typically adopt static timescales to regularly update scheduling decisions of each layer, without adaptive adjustment of timescales for different layers, resulting in potentially poor performance in practice.
  We notice that the adaptive timescales would significantly improve the trade-off between the operation cost and delay performance. Based on this insight, we propose EdgeTimer, the first work to automatically generate adaptive timescales to update multi-layer scheduling decisions using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First, EdgeTimer uses a three-layer hierarchical DRL framework to decouple the multi-layer decision-making task into a hierarchy of independent sub-tasks for improving learning efficiency. Second, to cope with each sub-task, EdgeTimer adopts a safe multi-agent DRL algorithm for decentralized scheduling while ensuring system reliability. We apply EdgeTimer to a wide range of Kubernetes scheduling rules, and evaluate it using production traces with different workload patterns. Extensive trace-driven experiments demonstrate that EdgeTimer can learn adaptive timescales, irrespective of workload patterns and built-in scheduling rules. It obtains up to 9.1x more profit than existing approaches without sacrificing the delay performance.</description>

      <title>COLoRIS: Localization-agnostic Smart Surfaces Enabling Opportunistic ISAC in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Smart Surfaces in 6G communication networks, also dubbed as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), is a promising paradigm change gaining significant attention given its disruptive features. RISs are a key enabler in the realm of 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems where novel services can be offered together with the future mobile networks communication capabilities. This paper addresses the critical challenge of precisely localizing users within a communication network by leveraging the controlled-reflective properties of RIS elements without relying on more power-hungry traditional methods, e.g., GPS, adverting the need of deploying additional infrastructure and even avoiding interfering with communication efforts. Moreover, we go one step beyond: we build COLoRIS, an Opportunistic ISAC approach that leverages localization agnostic RIS configurations to accurately position mobile users via trained learning models. Extensive experimental validation and simulations in large-scale synthetic scenarios show 5% positioning errors (with respect to field size) under different conditions. Further, we show that a low-complexity version running in a limited off-the-shelf (embedded, low-power) system achieves positioning errors in the 11% range at a negligible +2% energy expense with respect to the classical RIS.</description>

      <title>Boosting end-to-end entanglement fidelity in quantum repeater networks via hybridized strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks are expected to enhance distributed quantum computing and quantum communication over long distances while providing security dependent upon physical effects rather than mathematical assumptions. Through simulation, we show that a quantum network utilizing only entanglement purification or only quantum error correction as error management strategies cannot create Bell pairs with fidelity that exceeds the requirement for a secured quantum key distribution protocol for a broad range of hardware parameters. We propose hybrid strategies utilizing quantum error correction on top of purification and show that they can produce Bell pairs of sufficiently high fidelity. We identify the error parameter regime for gate and measurement errors in which these hybrid strategies are applicable.</description>

      <title>Beyond 5G Network Failure Classification for Network Digital Twin Using Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) core networks in network digital twins (NDTs) are complex systems with numerous components, generating considerable data. Analyzing these data can be challenging due to rare failure types, leading to imbalanced classes in multiclass classification. To address this problem, we propose a novel method of integrating a graph Fourier transform (GFT) into a message-passing neural network (MPNN) designed for NDTs. This approach transforms the data into a graph using the GFT to address class imbalance, whereas the MPNN extracts features and models dependencies between network components. This combined approach identifies failure types in real and simulated NDT environments, demonstrating its potential for accurate failure classification in 5G and beyond (B5G) networks. Moreover, the MPNN is adept at learning complex local structures among neighbors in an end-to-end setting. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed approach can identify failure types in three multiclass domain datasets at multiple failure points in real networks and NDT environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed GFT-MPNN can accurately classify network failures in B5G networks, especially when employed within NDTs to detect failure types.</description>

      <title>Design and Scheduling of an AI-based Queueing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To leverage prediction models to make optimal scheduling decisions in service systems, we must understand how predictive errors impact congestion due to externalities on the delay of other jobs. Motivated by applications where prediction models interact with human servers (e.g., content moderation), we consider a large queueing system comprising of many single server queues where the class of a job is estimated using a prediction model. By characterizing the impact of mispredictions on congestion cost in heavy traffic, we design an index-based policy that incorporates the predicted class information in a near-optimal manner. Our theoretical results guide the design of predictive models by providing a simple model selection procedure with downstream queueing performance as a central concern, and offer novel insights on how to design queueing systems with AI-based triage. We illustrate our framework on a content moderation task based on real online comments, where we construct toxicity classifiers by finetuning large language models.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Social Networks and the Future of Free Speech Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized social networks like Mastodon and BlueSky are trending topics that have drawn much attention and discussion in recent years. By devolving powers from the central node to the end users, decentralized social networks aim to cure existing pathologies on the centralized platforms and have been viewed by many as the future of the Internet. This article critically and systematically assesses the decentralization project's prospect for communications online. It uses normative theories of free speech to examine whether and how the decentralization design could facilitate users' freedom of expression online. The analysis shows that both promises and pitfalls exist, highlighting the importance of value-based design in this area. Two most salient issues for the design of the decentralized networks are: how to balance the decentralization ideal with constant needs of centralization on the network, and how to empower users to make them truly capable of exercising their control. The article then uses some design examples, such as the shared blocklist and the opt-in search function, to illustrate the value considerations underlying the design choices. Some tentative proposals for law and policy interventions are offered to better facilitate the design of the new network. Rather than providing clear answers, the article seeks to map the value implications of the design choices, highlight the stakes, and point directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Turning the Tide on Dark Pools? Towards Multi-Stakeholder Vulnerability Notifications in the Ad-Tech Supply Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online advertising relies on a complex and opaque supply chain that involves multiple stakeholders, including advertisers, publishers, and ad-networks, each with distinct and sometimes conflicting incentives. Recent research has demonstrated the existence of ad-tech supply chain vulnerabilities such as dark pooling, where low-quality publishers bundle their ad inventory with higher-quality ones to mislead advertisers. We investigate the effectiveness of vulnerability notification campaigns aimed at mitigating dark pooling. Prior research on vulnerability notifications has primarily focused on single-stakeholder scenarios, and it is unclear whether vulnerability notifications can be effective in the multi-stakeholder ad-tech supply chain. We implement an automated vulnerability notification pipeline to systematically evaluate the responsiveness of various stakeholders, including publishers, ad-networks, and advertisers to vulnerability notifications by academics and activists. Our nine-month long multi-stakeholder notification study shows that notifications are an effective method for reducing dark pooling vulnerabilities in the online advertising ecosystem, especially when targeted towards ad-networks. Further, the sender reputation does not impact responses to notifications from activists and academics in a statistically different way. In addition to being the first notification study targeting the online advertising ecosystem, we are also the first to study multi-stakeholder context in vulnerability notifications.</description>

      <title>Scaling Large-Language-Model-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pioneering advancements in large language model-powered agents have underscored the design pattern of multi-agent collaboration, demonstrating that collective intelligence can surpass the capabilities of each individual. Inspired by the neural scaling law, which posits that increasing neurons leads to emergent abilities, this study investigates whether a similar principle applies to increasing agents in multi-agent collaboration. Technically, we propose multi-agent collaboration networks (MacNet), which utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents and streamline their interactive reasoning via topological ordering, with solutions derived from their dialogues. Extensive experiments show that MacNet consistently outperforms baseline models, enabling effective agent collaboration across various network topologies and supporting cooperation among more than a thousand agents. Notably, we observed a small-world collaboration phenomenon, where topologies resembling small-world properties achieved superior performance. Additionally, we identified a collaborative scaling law, indicating that normalized solution quality follows a logistic growth pattern as scaling agents, with collaborative emergence occurring much earlier than previously observed instances of neural emergence. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.</description>
