      <title>Macroeconomics of Racial Disparities: Discrimination, Labor Market, and Wealth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of racial discrimination in hiring on employment, wage, and wealth disparities between black and white workers. Using a labor search-and-matching model with racially prejudiced and non-prejudiced firms, we show that labor market frictions sustain discriminatory practices as an equilibrium outcome. These practices account for 44% to 52% of the average wage gap and 16% of the median wealth gap. Discriminatory hiring also amplifies unemployment and wage volatility for black workers, increasing their labor market risks over business cycles. Eliminating prejudiced firms reduces these disparities and improves black workers' welfare, though it slightly decreases overall economic welfare.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Approach to Demand Estimation and Dynamic Pricing in Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the literature on parametric demand estimation by using deep learning to model consumer preferences. Traditional econometric methods often struggle with limited within-product price variation, a challenge addressed by the proposed neural network approach. The proposed method estimates the functional form of the demand and demonstrates higher performance in both simulations and empirical applications. Notably, under low price variation, the machine learning model outperforms econometric approaches, reducing the mean squared error of initial price parameter estimates by nearly threefold. In empirical setting, the ML model consistently predicts a negative relationship between demand and price in 100% of cases, whereas the econometric approach fails to do so in 20% of cases. The suggested model incorporates a wide range of product characteristics, as well as prices of other products and competitors.</description>
