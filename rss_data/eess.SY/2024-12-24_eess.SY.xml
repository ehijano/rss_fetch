      <title>Finite Abstractions of Network of Impulsive Systems Using Dissipativity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a compositional framework for constructing finite abstractions of nonlinear interconnected impulsive systems using dissipativity-based conditions. Central to our approach is the concept of "alternating simulation functions," which serve to relate the concrete dynamics of impulsive subsystems to their finite abstractions. Dissipativity conditions are employed to ensure the compositionality of the finite abstractions, enabling the representation of complex interconnected systems as compositions of their subsystem abstractions. The methodology relies on incremental passivity properties such as supply rates and storage functions, alongside forward completeness, to construct finite abstractions for individual impulsive subsystems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Attention-Based Adaptive Pressure for Multi-Intersection Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) system is a critical component of intelligent transportation, with the capability to significantly alleviate urban traffic congestion. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC, existing methods find it prone to convergence to local optima. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Attention-Based Adaptive Pressure (BCT-APRL) for multi-intersection signal control. In BCT-APRL, the Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to refine the RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian inference-based Critique layer provides effective evaluations of the credibility of policies; the Bayesian decision-based Tune layer fine-tunes policies by minimizing the posterior risks when the evaluations are negative. Furthermore, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) is designed to specify the traffic movement representation as an effective and efficient pressure of vehicle queues in the traffic network. Achieving enhances the reasonableness of RL policies. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator across a range of intersection layouts show that BCT-APRL is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in seven real-world datasets. Codes are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Predictive Monitoring of Black-Box Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of predictive runtime monitoring of black-box dynamical systems with quantitative safety properties. The black-box setting stipulates that the exact semantics of the dynamical system and the controller are unknown, and that we are only able to observe the state of the controlled (aka, closed-loop) system at finitely many time points. We present a novel framework for predicting future states of the system based on the states observed in the past. The numbers of past states and of predicted future states are parameters provided by the user. Our method is based on a combination of Taylor's expansion and the backward difference operator for numerical differentiation. We also derive an upper bound on the prediction error under the assumption that the system dynamics and the controller are smooth. The predicted states are then used to predict safety violations ahead in time. Our experiments demonstrate practical applicability of our method for complex black-box systems, showing that it is computationally lightweight and yet significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art predictive safety monitoring techniques.</description>

      <title>Vehicle Rebalancing Under Adherence Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ride hailing systems suffer from spatial-temporal supply demand imbalance due to drivers operating in independent, and uncoordinated manner. Several fleet rebalancing models have been proposed that can provide repositioning recommendations to idle standing drivers with the objective of maximizing service rate or minimizing customer waiting time. Existing models assume complete adherence by the drivers which leads to limited practical implementation of these models. A novel taxi rebalancing model and a procedure to compute recommendations for repositioning of taxis are proposed which accounts for uncertainties in adherence arising from taxi driver's preferences and the evolving confidence of the driver in the system due to outcomes of repositioning recommendations. Extensive simulations using NYC taxi dataset showed that the proposed model can lead to 6.3% higher allocation rates, 11.8% higher driver profits, 4.5% higher demand fulfillment, and 14% higher confidence of drivers in the rebalancing system, as compared to a state-of-the-art rebalancing model that is agnostic to the taxi driver preferences and confidence in the system.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Error Analysis of Subspace Identification for Deterministic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the perturbation error analysis of the widely-used Subspace Identification Methods (SIM) for n-dimensional discrete-time Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems with m outputs, based on finite input/output sample data. Using a single input/output trajectory, we provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the perturbation errors for the system matrices in state-space models as well as the system poles for two unified algorithms, offering a unified perspective across various SIM variants. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when the ratio n/m is large, regardless of system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the ill-conditionedness of SIMs.</description>

      <title>Fixed-Time Input-to-State Stability for Singularly Perturbed Systems via Composite Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study singularly perturbed systems that exhibit input-to-state stability (ISS) with fixed-time properties in the presence of bounded disturbances. In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.</description>

      <title>NMPC and Deep Learning-Based Vibration Control of Satellite Beam Antenna Dynamics Using PZT Actuators and Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for vibration control of satellite-based flexible beam-type antennas using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and Deep Learning techniques. The developed control system leverages piezoelectric (PZT) actuators and sensors to manage the coupled attitude and structural dynamics of the satellite, improving precision and stability. We propose a detailed coupled dynamics model that integrates both satellite attitude and beam structural dynamics, considering the effects of PZT-based actuators. Through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined NMPC and Deep Learning framework in reducing structural vibrations, achieving faster response times, and enhancing overall control accuracy. The results indicate that the proposed system provides a robust solution for controlling flexible beam-type satellite antennas in space environments.</description>

      <title>Distributed Target Tracking based on Localization with Linear Time-Difference-of-Arrival Measurements: A Delay-Tolerant Networked Estimation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers target tracking based on a beacon signal's time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) to a group of cooperating sensors. The sensors receive a reflected signal from the target where the time-of-arrival (TOA) renders the distance information. The existing approaches include: (i) classic centralized solutions which gather and process the target data at a central unit, (ii) distributed solutions which assume that the target data is observable in the dense neighborhood of each sensor (to be filtered locally), and (iii) double time-scale distributed methods with high rates of communication/consensus over the network. This work, in order to reduce the network connectivity in (i)-(ii) and communication rate in (iii), proposes a distributed single time-scale technique, which can also handle heterogeneous constant data-exchange delays over the static sensor network. This work assumes only distributed observability (in contrast to local observability in some existing works categorized in (ii)), i.e., the target is observable globally over a (strongly) connected network. The (strong) connectivity further allows for survivable network and $q$-redundant observer design. Each sensor locally shares information and processes the received data in its immediate neighborhood via local linear-matrix-inequalities (LMI) feedback gains to ensure tracking error stability. The same gain matrix works in the presence of heterogeneous delays with no need of redesigning algorithms. Since most existing distributed estimation scenarios are linear (based on consensus), many works use linearization of the existing nonlinear TDOA measurement models where the output matrix is a function of the target position.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Neural Networks to Optimize Heliostat Field Aiming Strategies in Concentrating Solar Power Tower Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentrating Solar Power Tower (CSPT) plants rely on heliostat fields to focus sunlight onto a central receiver. Although simple aiming strategies, such as directing all heliostats to the receivers equator, can maximize energy collection, they often result in uneven flux distributions that lead to hotspots, thermal stresses, and reduced receiver lifetimes. This paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that integrates constraint learning, neural network-based surrogates, and mathematical optimization to overcome these challenges. The methodology learns complex heliostat-to-receiver flux interactions from simulation data, constructing a surrogate model that is embedded into a tractable optimization framework. By maximizing a tailored quality score that balances energy collection and flux uniformity, the approach yields smoothly distributed flux profiles and mitigates excessive thermal peaks. An iterative refinement process, guided by the trust region and progressive data sampling, ensures the surrogate model improves the obtained solution by exploring new spaces during the iterations. Results from a real CSPT case study demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses conventional heuristic methods, offering flatter flux distributions and safer thermal conditions without a substantial loss in overall energy capture.</description>

      <title>Resilience Dynamics in Coupled Natural-Industrial Systems: A Surrogate Modeling Approach for Assessing Climate Change Impacts on Industrial Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial ecosystems are coupled with natural systems through utilization of feedstocks and waste disposal. To ensure resilience in production of industrial systems under the threat of climate change scenarios, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of this coupling on productivity and waste generation. In this work, we present a novel methodology for modeling and assessing the resilience of coupled natural-industrial ecosystems under climate change scenarios. We develop a computationally efficient framework that integrates liquid time-constant (LTC) neural networks as surrogate models to capture complex, nonlinear dynamics of coupled agricultural and industrial systems. The approach is demonstrated through a case study of a soybean-based biodiesel production network in Champaign County, Illinois. LTC models are trained to capture dynamics of nodes and are then coupled and driven by statistically downscaled climate projections for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios from 2006-2096. The framework enables rapid simulation of system-wide material flow dynamics and exploration of cascading effects from climate-induced disruptions. Results reveal non-linear behaviors and potential tipping points in system resilience under different climate scenarios and farm sizes. The RCP 8.5 scenario led to earlier and more frequent production failures, increased reliance on imports for smaller farms, and complex patterns of waste accumulation and stock levels. The methodology provides valuable insights into system vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities, offering decision support for enhancing the resilience and sustainability of coupled natural-industrial ecosystems in the face of climate change. The framework's adaptability suggests potential applications across various industrial ecosystems and climate-sensitive sectors</description>

      <title>Accuracy and robust early detection of short-circuit faults in single-cell lithium battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective early-stage detection of internal short circuit in lithium-ion batteries is crucial to preventing thermal runaway. This report proposes an effective approach to address this challenging issue, in which the current change, state of charge and resistance are considered simultaneously to depict the voltage differential envelope curve. The envelope naturally utilizes the inherent physical information of the battery and accounts for error interference, providing a high-precision range for battery voltage fluctuations under any operating conditions. This study validates the algorithm using data from 10 fault intervals under dynamic operating condition. The results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves 100% accuracy and responds rapidly, enabling timely detection of early-stage internal short circuit faults in batteries. Compared to signal processing-based and neural network methods, the proposed approach offers significant advantages in both accuracy and practicality, making it highly relevant for the safe application and widespread adoption of lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Coupled differential-algebraic equations framework for modeling six-degree-of-freedom flight dynamics of asymmetric fixed-wing aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive mathematical framework for modeling the flight dynamics of a six-degree-of-freedom fixed-wing aircraft as a rigid body with three control surfaces: rudder, elevators, and ailerons. The framework consists of 35 differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) and requires 30 constants to be specified. It supports both direct and inverse flight dynamics analyses. In direct dynamics, the historical profiles of control inputs (deflection angles and engine thrust) are specified, and the resulting flight trajectory is predicted. In inverse dynamics, the desired flight trajectory and an additional constraint are specified to determine the required control inputs. The framework employs wind axes for linear-momentum equations and body axes for angular-momentum equations, incorporates two flight path angles, and provides formulas for aerodynamic force and moment coefficients. Key advantages include improved computational efficiency, elimination of Euler angle singularities, and independence from symmetry assumptions with regard to the aircraft's moments of inertia. The model also accounts for nonlinear air density variations with altitude, up to 20 km above mean sea level, making it suitable for accurate and efficient flight dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Risk-Sensitive Orbital Debris Collision Avoidance using Distributionally Robust Chance Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential increase in orbital debris and active satellites will lead to congested orbits, necessitating more frequent collision avoidance maneuvers by satellites. To minimize fuel consumption while ensuring the safety of satellites, enforcing a chance constraint, which poses an upper bound in collision probability with debris, can serve as an intuitive safety measure. However, accurately evaluating collision probability, which is critical for the effective implementation of chance constraints, remains a non-trivial task. This difficulty arises because uncertainty propagation in nonlinear orbit dynamics typically provides only limited information, such as finite samples or moment estimates about the underlying arbitrary non-Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, even if the full distribution were known, it remains unclear how to effectively compute chance constraints with such non-Gaussian distributions. To address these challenges, we propose a distributionally robust chance-constrained collision avoidance algorithm that provides a sufficient condition for collision probabilities under limited information about the underlying non-Gaussian distribution. Our distributionally robust approach satisfies the chance constraint for all debris position distributions sharing a given mean and covariance, thereby enabling the enforcement of chance constraints with limited distributional information. To achieve computational tractability, the chance constraint is approximated using a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint, which gives a conservative and tractable approximation of the distributionally robust chance constraint. We validate our algorithm on a real-world inspired satellite-debris conjunction scenario with different uncertainty propagation methods and show that our controller can effectively avoid collisions.</description>

      <title>Neural Continuous-Time Supermartingale Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce for the first time a neural-certificate framework for continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems. Autonomous learning systems in the physical world demand continuous-time reasoning, yet existing learnable certificates for probabilistic verification assume discretization of the time continuum. Inspired by the success of training neural Lyapunov certificates for deterministic continuous-time systems and neural supermartingale certificates for stochastic discrete-time systems, we propose a framework that bridges the gap between continuous-time and probabilistic neural certification for dynamical systems under complex requirements. Our method combines machine learning and symbolic reasoning to produce formally certified bounds on the probabilities that a nonlinear system satisfies specifications of reachability, avoidance, and persistence. We present both the theoretical justification and the algorithmic implementation of our framework and showcase its efficacy on popular benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on what we call Reaction Network Cardon Dioxide Removal (RNDCR) framework to analyze several proposed negative emissions technologies (NETs) so as to determine when present-day Earth carbon cycle system would exhibit multistationarity (steady-state multiplicity) or possibly monostationarity, that will in effect lower the rising earth temperature. Using mathematical modeling based on the techniques of chemical reaction network theory (CRNT), we propose an RNDCR system consisting of the Anderies subnetwork, fossil fuel emission reaction, the carbon capture subnetwork and the carbon storage subnetwork. The RNCDR framework analysis was done in the cases of two NETs: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage and Afforestation/Reforestation. It was found out that these two methods of carbon dioxide removal are almost similar with respect to their network properties and their capacities to exhibit multistationarity and absolute concentration robustness in certain species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution factors are indispensable tools in the design and analysis of power transmission grids. Recently, they received a renewed interest in the field of topology optimization, leading to the definition of bus merge and bus split distribution factors. In this article, we introduce a unified derivation of the most relevant distribution factors based on matrix algebraic manipulations. This approach facilitates the generalization to more complex grid modification, in particular simultaneous switching events or bus splits.</description>

      <title>Mean--Variance Portfolio Selection by Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms, Regret Analysis, and Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continuous-time mean--variance portfolio selection in markets where stock prices are diffusion processes driven by observable factors that are also diffusion processes yet the coefficients of these processes are unknown. Based on the recently developed reinforcement learning (RL) theory for diffusion processes, we present a general data-driven RL algorithm that learns the pre-committed investment strategy directly without attempting to learn or estimate the market coefficients. For multi-stock Black--Scholes markets without factors, we further devise a baseline algorithm and prove its performance guarantee by deriving a sublinear regret bound in terms of Sharpe ratio. For performance enhancement and practical implementation, we modify the baseline algorithm into four variants, and carry out an extensive empirical study to compare their performance, in terms of a host of common metrics, with a large number of widely used portfolio allocation strategies on S\&amp;P 500 constituents. The results demonstrate that the continuous-time RL strategies are consistently among the best especially in a volatile bear market, and decisively outperform the model-based continuous-time counterparts by significant margins.</description>

      <title>CLIP-RLDrive: Human-Aligned Autonomous Driving via CLIP-Based Reward Shaping in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents CLIP-RLDrive, a new reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for improving the decision-making of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in complex urban driving scenarios, particularly in unsignalized intersections. To achieve this goal, the decisions for AVs are aligned with human-like preferences through Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based reward shaping. One of the primary difficulties in RL scheme is designing a suitable reward model, which can often be challenging to achieve manually due to the complexity of the interactions and the driving scenarios. To deal with this issue, this paper leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly CLIP, to build an additional reward model based on visual and textual cues.</description>

      <title>Communications Performance Analysis of Wireless Multiple Access Channel with Specially Correlated Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From both practical and theoretical viewpoints, performance analysis of communication systems using information-theoretic results is very important. In this study, first, we obtain a general achievable rate for a two-user wireless multiple access channel (MAC) with specially correlated sources as a more general version for continuous alphabet MACs, by extending the known discrete alphabet results to the wireless continuous alphabet version. Next, the impact of wireless channel coefficients correlation on the performance metrics using Copula theory, as the most convenient way for describing the dependence between several variables, is investigated. By applying the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) Copula function, we obtain closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) under positive/negative dependence conditions. It is shown that the fading correlation improves the OP for a negative dependence structure. Specifically, whenever the dependence structure tends to negative values, the OP decreases and the efficiency of the channel increases. Finally, the efficiency of the analytical results is illustrated numerically.</description>

      <title>SOUS VIDE: Cooking Visual Drone Navigation Policies in a Gaussian Splatting Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new simulator, training approach, and policy architecture, collectively called SOUS VIDE, for end-to-end visual drone navigation. Our trained policies exhibit zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with robust real-world performance using only on-board perception and computation. Our simulator, called FiGS, couples a computationally simple drone dynamics model with a high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting scene reconstruction. FiGS can quickly simulate drone flights producing photorealistic images at up to 130 fps. We use FiGS to collect 100k-300k observation-action pairs from an expert MPC with privileged state and dynamics information, randomized over dynamics parameters and spatial disturbances. We then distill this expert MPC into an end-to-end visuomotor policy with a lightweight neural architecture, called SV-Net. SV-Net processes color image, optical flow and IMU data streams into low-level body rate and thrust commands at 20Hz onboard a drone. Crucially, SV-Net includes a Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) module that adapts at runtime to variations in drone dynamics. In a campaign of 105 hardware experiments, we show SOUS VIDE policies to be robust to 30% mass variations, 40 m/s wind gusts, 60% changes in ambient brightness, shifting or removing objects from the scene, and people moving aggressively through the drone's visual field. Code, data, and experiment videos can be found on our project page: https://stanfordmsl.github.io/SousVide/.</description>

      <title>To Travel Quickly or to Park Conveniently: Coupled Resource Allocations with Multi-Karma Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale allocation of public resources (e.g., transportation, energy) is among the core challenges of future Cyber-Physical-Human Systems (CPHS). In order to guarantee that these systems are efficient and fair, recent works have investigated non-monetary resource allocation schemes, including schemes that employ karma. Karma is a non-tradable token that flows from users gaining resources to users yielding resources. Thus far karma-based solutions considered the allocation of a single public resource, however, modern CPHS are complex as they involve the allocation of multiple coupled resources. For example, a user might want to trade-off fast travel on highways for convenient parking in the city center, and different users could have heterogeneous preferences for such coupled resources. In this paper, we explore how to optimally combine multiple karma economies for coupled resource allocations, using two mechanism-design instruments: (non-uniform) karma redistribution; and (non-unit) exchange rates. We first extend the existing Dynamic Population Game (DPG) model that predicts the Stationary Nash Equilibrium (SNE) of the multi-karma economies. Then, in a numerical case study, we demonstrate that the design of redistribution significantly affects the coupled resource allocations, while non-unit exchange rates play a minor role. To assess the allocation outcomes under user heterogeneity, we adopt Nash welfare as our social welfare function, since it makes no interpersonal comparisons and it is axiomatically rooted in social choice theory. Our findings suggest that the simplest mechanism design, that is, uniform redistribution with unit exchange rates, also attains maximum social welfare.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive Data-Driven Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning in SSP Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptive data-driven controller is proposed and analysed for the class of infinite-horizon optimal control of positive linear system problems presented in (\cite{ohlin2024optimal}). This controller is synthesized from the solution of a ``data-driven algebraic equation" constructed from the model-free Bellman equation used in Q-learning. This algebraic equation is driven by data correlation matrices that does not scale in the number of data points, making for an efficient online implementation. As a result, a sufficient condition that ensures stability and robustness against unmodeled dynamics in the plant is extracted. The derived results also allows for a quantitative characterization of the interplay between explorations and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal control problems considered here bears equivalence to Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed adaptive policy and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest path, as presented in the numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Model Predictive Path Integral Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to improve the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control by using a transformer to initialize the mean control sequence. Traditional MPPI methods often struggle with sample efficiency and computational costs due to suboptimal initial rollouts. We propose TransformerMPPI, which uses a transformer trained on historical control data to generate informed initial mean control sequences. TransformerMPPI combines the strengths of the attention mechanism in transformers and sampling-based control, leading to improved computational performance and sample efficiency. The ability of the transformer to capture long-horizon patterns in optimal control sequences allows TransformerMPPI to start from a more informed control sequence, reducing the number of samples required, and accelerating convergence to optimal control sequence. We evaluate our method on various control tasks, including avoidance of collisions in a 2D environment and autonomous racing in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Numerical simulations demonstrate that TransformerMPPI consistently outperforms traditional MPPI algorithms in terms of overall average cost, sample efficiency, and computational speed in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles.</description>

      <title>A Reproducible Method for Mapping Electricity Transmission Infrastructure for Space Weather Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset information to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in Extra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central issue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC prediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical circuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data, which enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data. This process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to high-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by utilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component annotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage (&gt;115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs utilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total of 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation voltage levels (&gt;345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of 7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide new detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation configurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method and data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid scalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible web-browser application.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Federated Learning: A Scalable Approach for Decentralized Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients without sharing raw data. However, traditional FL approaches often face limitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous client updates, which can result in significant delays and increased communication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model independently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive convergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model staleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance bounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming strongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient variance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula quantifying the impact of client delays on convergence. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical applicability of AFL by training a decentralized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning model on the CMIP6 climate dataset, effectively handling non-IID and geographically distributed data.
  The proposed AFL algorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL methods, such as inefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility to client drift. It enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world settings with heterogeneous client populations and dynamic network conditions. Our results underscore the potential of AFL to drive advancements in distributed learning systems, particularly for large-scale, privacy-preserving applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to utilizing underactuated quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as assistive devices in cooperative payload transportation task through human guidance and physical interaction. The proposed system consists of two underactuated UAVs rigidly connected to the transported payload. This task involves the collaboration between human and UAVs to transport and manipulate a payload. The goal is to reduce the workload of the human and enable seamless interaction between the human operator and the aerial vehicle. An Admittance-Nonsingular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control (NFTSMC) is employed to control and asymptotically stabilize the system while performing the task, where forces are applied to the payload by the human operator dictate the aerial vehicle's motion. The stability of the proposed controller is confirmed using Lyapunov analysis. Extensive simulation studies were conducted using MATLAB, Robot Operating System (ROS), and Gazebo to validate robustness and effectiveness of the proposed controller in assisting with payload transportation tasks. Results demonstrates feasibility and potential benefits utilizing quadrotor UAVs as assistive devices for payload transportation through intuitive human-guided control.

Abstract: The power system of the future will be governed by complex interactions and non-linear phenomena at small time-scales, that should be studied more and more through computationally expensive software simulations. To solve the abovementioned problems, power system engineers face problems with following characteristics: (i) a computationally expensive simulator, (ii) non-linear functions to optimize and (iii) lack of abundance of data. Existing optimization settings involving EMT-type simulations have been developed, but mainly use a deterministic model and optimizer, which may be computationally inefficient and do not guarantee finding a global optimum. Furthermore, the main focus has been on optimization routines, and less attention has been paid to other tasks such as classification. In this paper, an automation framework based on Bayesian Optimization is introduced, and applied to two case studies involving optimization and classification. It is found that the framework has the potential to reduce computational effort, outperform deterministic optimizers and is applicable to a multitude of problems. Nevertheless, it was found that the output of the Bayesian Optimization depends on the number of samples used for initialization, and in addition, careful selection of surrogate models, which should be subject to future investigation.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Arc Fault Detection for Electrical Distribution Systems: A Comprehensive Review from Artificial Intelligence Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This comprehensive review paper provides a thorough examination of current advancements and research in the field of arc fault detection for electrical distribution systems. The increasing demand for electricity, coupled with the increasing utilization of renewable energy sources, has necessitated vigilance in safeguarding electrical distribution systems against arc faults. Such faults could lead to catastrophic accidents, including fires, equipment damage, loss of human life, and other critical issues. To mitigate these risks, this review article focuses on the identification and early detection of arc faults, with a particular emphasis on the vital role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the detection and prediction of arc faults. The paper explores a wide range of methodologies for arc fault detection and highlights the superior performance of AI-based methods in accurately identifying arc faults when compared to other approaches.

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on Modelling and Control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) have become the de facto vehicle for remote operations involving oceanography, inspection, and monitoring tasks. These vehicles operate in different and often challenging environments; hence, the design and development of the AUV involving hydrodynamics and control systems need to be designed in detail. This book chapter presents a study on the modelling and robust control of a research vehicle in the presence of uncertainties. The vehicle's dynamic behaviour is modelled using a 6-degree-of-freedom approach, considering the effect of ocean currents. The level flight requirements for different speeds are derived, and the resulting model is decomposed into horizontal and vertical subsystems for linear analysis. The simulation results presented focus on the efficacy of linear controllers within three key subsystems: depth, yaw, and speed. Moreover, level-flight outcomes are demonstrated for a speed of 4 knots. The nonlinear control strategies employed in this study encompass conventional and sliding-mode control (SMC) methodologies. To ensure accurate tracking performance, the controller design considers the vehicle's dynamics with various uncertainties such as ocean currents, parameter uncertainty, CG (Center of Gravity) deviation and buoyancy variation. Both conventional and nonlinear SMC controllers' outcomes are showcased with a lawn-mowing manoeuvre scenario. A systematic comparison is drawn between the robustness of SMC against disturbances and parameter fluctuations in contrast to conventional controllers. Importantly, these results underscore the trade-off that accompanies SMC's robustness, as it necessitates a higher level of complexity in terms of controller design, intricate implementation intricacies, and the management of chattering phenomena.</description>

      <title>NN-ETM: Enabling safe neural network-based event-triggering mechanisms for consensus problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-triggering mechanisms (ETM) have been developed for consensus problems to reduce communication while ensuring performance guarantees, but their design has grown increasingly complex by incorporating the agent's local and neighbor information. This typically results in ad-hoc solutions, which may only work for the consensus protocol under consideration. We aim to safely incorporate neural networks in the ETM to provide a general solution while guaranteeing performance. To decouple the stability analysis of the consensus protocol from the abstraction of the neural network, we derive design criteria for the consensus and ETM pair, allowing independent analysis of each element under mild constraints. Then, we propose NN-ETM, a novel ETM featuring a neural network, to optimize communication while preserving the stability guarantees of the consensus protocol.</description>

      <title>Addressing Trust Issues for Vehicle to Grid in Distributed Power Grids Using Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16180v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While blockchain offers inherent security, trust issues among stakeholders in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications remain unresolved due to a lack of regulatory frameworks and standardization. Additionally, a tailored decentralized privacy-preserved coordination scheme for blockchain in V2G networks is needed to ensure user privacy and efficient energy transactions. This paper proposes a V2G trading and coordination scheme tailored to the decentralized nature of blockchain as well as the interests of stakeholders utilizing smart charging points (SCPs) and Stackelberg game model. Case studies using real-world data from Southern University of Science and Technology demonstrate the efficacy of proposed scheme in reducing EV charging costs and the potential for supporting auxiliary grid services.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection and Identification Using a Novel Process Decomposition Algorithm for Distributed Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in fault detection and identification increasingly relies on sophisticated techniques for fault detection, applied through either centralized or distributed approaches. Instead of increasing the sophistication of the fault detection method, this work introduces a novel algorithm for determining process blocks of interacting measurements and applies principal component analysis (PCA) at the block level to identify fault occurrences. Additionally, we define a novel contributions map that scales the magnitudes of disparate faults to facilitate the visual identification of abnormal values of measured variables and analysis of fault propagation. Bayesian aggregate fault index and block fault indices vs. time pinpoint origins of the fault. The proposed method yields fault detection rates on par with most sophisticated centralized or distributed methods on the Tennessee Eastman Plant benchmark. Since the decomposition algorithm relies on the process flowsheet and control loop structures, practicing control engineers can implement the proposed method in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Analytical Construction of CBF-Based Safety Filters for Simultaneous State and Input Constraints (Extended Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem explored in [1] of guaranteeing satisfaction of multiple simultaneous state constraints applied to a single-input, single-output plant consisting of a chain of n integrators subject to input limitations. For this problem setting, we derive an analytic, easy-to-implement safety filter which respects input limitations and ensures forward-invariance of all state constraints simultaneously. Additionally, we provide a straightforward extension to the multi-input, multi-output chained integrator setting, and provide an analytic safety filter guaranteeing satisfaction of arbitrarily many simultaneous hyperplane constraints on the output vector. Whereas the approach in [1] obtains maximal invariant sets, our approach trades off some degree of conservatism in exchange for a recursive safety filter which is analytic for any arbitrary n &gt;= 1.</description>

      <title>Distribution Grids May Be a Barrier To Residential Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric alternatives can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in many settings. However, residential electrification can raise electricity demand beyond the safe limits of electrical infrastructure, increasing the risk of blackouts or requiring grid reinforcement that can be slow and expensive. Here, we estimate the physical and economic impacts on distribution grids of electrifying all housing and personal vehicles in each county of the lower 48 United States. We find that space heating is the main driver of grid impacts, with the coldest regions seeing demand peaks up to five times higher than today's peaks. Accommodating electrification of all housing and personal vehicles could require up to 544 GW of distribution grid reinforcement nationally, at a cost of \$320 to \$720 billion, or \$2,600 to \$5,800 per household (95% confidence intervals). However, demand-side management can mitigate demand peaks, reducing grid reinforcement costs by up to 77%.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review: Impacts of Extreme Temperatures due to Climate Change on Power Grid Infrastructure and Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power grid is experiencing a multi-fold transformation while the global climate evolves with record-breaking extreme temperatures during heat domes, polar vortices, and severe ice. Over the decades, these extreme temperature events have increased in frequency, duration, and intensity. The power grid infrastructure is geographically spread over thousands of square miles with millions of small and large components, and the impact of extreme temperature operations on the grid infrastructure needs to be researched further. This paper reviews academic literature, standards, industry articles, and federal reports to identify the impacts of heat domes, polar vortices, and icing on all the T&amp;D grid equipment, including substations (assets owned and operated by the utilities and independent system operators). This paper classifies the equipment into primary and auxiliary equipment and determines its vulnerability to extreme temperatures for a deeper analysis of a more critical and vulnerable set of grid equipment. For each equipment under consideration, its fundamental role in the system, the impact of extreme temperatures on its operation, available monitoring, and mitigation of these impacts are discussed. The paper develops insights on standards readiness and identifies gaps concerning extreme temperature definitions. The paper also develops summary tables to identify the critical failure modes for each type of equipment, failure influence diagrams, and cascading influence diagrams to highlight and aid in translating the equipment vulnerability information into power grid contingency definitions that need to be considered in grid planning and operations.</description>

      <title>Flexibility Options: A Proposed Product for Managing Imbalance Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of variable renewable energy resources with uncertain outputs in day-ahead electricity markets results in additional balancing needs in real-time. Addressing those needs cost-effectively and reliably within a competitive market with unbundled products is challenging as both the demand for and the availability of flexibility depends on day-ahead energy schedules. Existing approaches for reserve procurement usually rely either on oversimplified demand curves that do not consider how system conditions that particular day affect the value of flexibility, or on bilateral trading of hedging instruments that are not co-optimized with day-ahead schedules. This article proposes a new product, `Flexibility Options', to address these two limitations. The demand for this product is endogenously determined in the day-ahead market and it is met cost-effectively by considering real-time supply curves for product providers, which are co-optimized with the energy supply. As we illustrate with numerical examples and mathematical analysis, the product addresses the hedging needs of participants with imbalances cost-effectively, provides a less intermittent revenue stream for participants with flexible outputs, promotes value-driven pricing of flexibility, and ensures that the system operator is revenue-neutral. This article provides a comprehensive design that can be further tested and applied in large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>TGOSPA Metric Parameters Selection and Evaluation for Visual Multi-object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each with unique performance requirements. For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Verification with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06136v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach to the quantitative verification of probabilistic programs and stochastic dynamical models. Our approach leverages neural networks to compute tight and sound bounds for the probability that a stochastic process hits a target condition within finite time. This problem subsumes a variety of quantitative verification questions, from the reachability and safety analysis of discrete-time stochastic dynamical models, to the study of assertion-violation and termination analysis of probabilistic programs. We rely on neural networks to represent supermartingale certificates that yield such probability bounds, which we compute using a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop: we train the neural certificate while tightening the probability bound over samples of the state space using stochastic optimisation, and then we formally check the certificate's validity over every possible state using satisfiability modulo theories; if we receive a counterexample, we add it to our set of samples and repeat the loop until validity is confirmed. We demonstrate on a diverse set of benchmarks that, thanks to the expressive power of neural networks, our method yields smaller or comparable probability bounds than existing symbolic methods in all cases, and that our approach succeeds on models that are entirely beyond the reach of such alternative techniques.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently interest has increased in applying reactive synthesis to more practical richer-than-Boolean domains. One of the major challenges in this area is to establish when certain repeating behaviour terminates in a desired state when the number of steps is unbounded. This isolated problem, by itself, is already undecidable, and forms part of the overall difficulty of this kind of synthesis tasks. Relatively successful approaches exist for deterministic games with at most B{\"u}chi conditions. Our contribution goes beyond, being the first effective approach for solving symbolic synthesis problems with full LTL objectives, based on novel liveness refinements guided by the underlying game. Our CEGAR-based approach relies on a sound boolean abstraction of the problem, spuriousness checking of abstract counterstrategies through invariant checking, and extracting fresh safety or liveness properties of the concrete game from counterexamples. The latter are used to refine the abstraction, which is used to re-attempt synthesis. Our discrete synthesis tool outperforms the state-of-the-art on LIA benchmarks from literature. We also introduce benchmarks that are out of scope for all other approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyborg insects refer to hybrid robots that integrate living insects with miniature electronic controllers to enable robotic-like programmable control. These creatures exhibit advantages over conventional robots in adaption to complex terrain and sustained energy efficiency. Nevertheless, there is a lack of literature on the control of multi-cyborg systems. This research gap is due to the difficulty in coordinating the movements of a cyborg system under the presence of insects' inherent individual variability in their reactions to control input. Regarding this issue, we propose a swarm navigation algorithm and verify it under experiments. This research advances swarm robotics by integrating biological organisms with control theory to develop intelligent autonomous systems for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Saturation of the Multiparameter Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound at the Single-Copy Level with Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum parameter estimation theory is an important component of quantum information theory and provides the statistical foundation that underpins important topics such as quantum system identification and quantum waveform estimation. When there is more than one parameter the ultimate precision in the mean square error given by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound is not necessarily achievable. For non-full rank quantum states, it was not known when this bound can be saturated (achieved) when only a single copy of the quantum state encoding the unknown parameters is available. This single-copy scenario is important because of its experimental/practical tractability. Recently, necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound in the multiparameter single-copy scenario have been established in terms of i) the commutativity of a set of projected symmetric logarithmic derivatives and ii) the existence of a unitary solution to a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. New sufficient conditions were also obtained that only depend on properties of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives. In this paper, key structural properties of optimal measurements that saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound are illuminated. These properties are exploited to i) show that the sufficient conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient for an optimal measurement to be projective, ii) give an alternative proof of previously established necessary conditions, and iii) describe general POVMs, not necessarily projective, that saturate the multiparameter QCRB. Examples are given where a unitary solution to the system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be explicitly calculated when the required conditions are fulfilled.</description>

Abstract: Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Learning of Dish Rinsing and Scrubbing based on Interruptive Direct Teaching Considering Assistance Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09360</link>

Abstract: Robots are expected to manipulate objects in a safe and dexterous way. For example, washing dishes is a dexterous operation that involves scrubbing the dishes with a sponge and rinsing them with water. It is necessary to learn it safely without splashing water and without dropping the dishes. In this study, we propose a safe and dexterous manipulation system. The robot learns a dynamics model of the object by estimating the state of the object and the robot itself, the control input, and the amount of human assistance required (assistance rate) after the human corrects the initial trajectory of the robot's hands by interruptive direct teaching. By backpropagating the error between the estimated and the reference value using the acquired dynamics model, the robot can generate a control input that approaches the reference value, for example, so that human assistance is not required and the dish does not move excessively. This allows for adaptive rinsing and scrubbing of dishes with unknown shapes and properties. As a result, it is possible to generate safe actions that require less human assistance.</description>

      <title>Stability and Performance Analysis on Self-dual Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonsymmetric solutions to certain Lyapunov and Riccati equations and inequalities with coefficient matrices corresponding to cone-preserving dynamical systems. Most results presented here appear to be novel even in the special case of positive systems. First, we provide a simple eigenvalue criterion for a Sylvester equation to admit a cone-preserving solution. For a single system preserving a self-dual cone, this reduces to stability. Further, we provide a set of conditions equivalent to testing a given H-infinity norm bound, as in the bounded real lemma. These feature the stability of a coefficient matrix similar to the Hamiltonian, a solution to two conic inequalities, and a stabilizing cone-preserving solution to a nonsymmetric Riccati equation. Finally, we show that the H-infinity norm is attained at zero frequency.</description>
