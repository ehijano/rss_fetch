      <title>Long Secondary Periods in Red Giants: AAVSO Observations and the Eclipse Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At least a third of red giants show a long secondary period (LSP), 5 to 10 times longer than the pulsation period. There is strong evidence that the LSP is caused by eclipses of the red giant by a dust-enshrouded low-mass companion. We have used long-term AAVSO observations of 11 stars to study two aspects of the eclipse hypothesis: the relation between the LSP phase (eclipse) curve and the geometry of the eclipse, and the long-term (decades) changes in the LSP phenomenon in each star. The stars with the largest LSP amplitudes show evidence of a dust tail on the companion, but most of the 11 stars show only a small-amplitude sinusoidal phase curve. The LSP amplitudes of all the stars vary slowly by up to a factor of 8, suggesting that the amount of obscuring dust varies by that amount, but there is no strong evidence that the geometry of the system changes over many decades.</description>

      <title>Density fluctuation-Mach number scaling in compressible, high plasma beta turbulence: in-situ space observations and high-Reynolds number simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of compressible fluctuations in a broad range of turbulent plasmas, from the intracluster medium to the solar wind, has been an active field of research in the past decades. Theoretical frameworks for weakly compressible MHD turbulence in an inhomogeneous background magnetic field predict a linear scaling of the normalized mass density fluctuation ($\delta \rho / \rho_0$), as a function of the turbulent Mach number ($\mathcal{M}_t$), $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$. However, so far the scaling relation has been tested only using moderate to low plasma beta ($\beta \lesssim 1$) solar wind observational data where the compressibility is weak $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \sim 0.1$. Here, we combine NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission data in Earth's magnetosheath, where $\beta \sim 10$ is high, and $\beta \sim 1$ highly-compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations at unprecedented resolutions. Both show that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ holds across a broad range of $\delta \rho / \rho_0$, $\mathcal{M}_t$ and $\beta$, demonstrating that $\delta \rho / \rho_0 \propto \mathcal{M}_t$ is a robust compressible turbulence relation, going beyond the asymptotics of the weakly compressible theory. We discuss the findings in the context of understanding the nature of strongly compressible turbulent fluctuations and the driving parameter in astrophysical and space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Deep Optical Images of the Ejecta Nebula Around the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 8 (HD 62910)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of deep H-alpha and [O III] images of the bright WN7/WC4 Wolf-Rayet star WR 8 (HD 62910). These data show considerably more surrounding nebulosity than seen in prior imaging. The brighter portions of the nebula span 6' in diameter and exhibit considerable fine-scale structure including numerous emission clumps and bright head-tail like features presumably due to the effects of the WR star's stellar winds. Due to the overlap of a relatively bright band of unrelated foreground diffuse interstellar H-alpha emission, WR 8's nebula is best viewed via its [O III] emission. A faint 9' x 13' diffuse outer nebulosity is detected surrounding the nebula's main ring of emission. The nebula's optical structure is substantially different from that of its thermal continuum dust emission seen in WISE 22 micron infrared images which show a smaller and sharply defined emission shell.</description>

      <title>The EBLM project -- XIV. TESS light curves for eclipsing binaries with very low mass companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate limb-darkening models are needed for accurate characterisation of eclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanets from the analysis of their light curves. The limb-darkening observed in solar-type stars from the analysis of light curves for transiting hot-Jupiter exoplanets are systematically less steep than predicted by stellar model atmospheres that do not account for the stellar magnetic field. Hot-Jupiter host stars tend to be metal rich ([Fe/H] ~0.25) leading to a lack of low- and solar-metallicity targets in previous studies, so we have analysed the TESS light curves for a sample of 19 stars with transiting M-dwarf companions to extend the range of limb-darkening measurements to [Fe/H] values more typical for solar-type stars. We find that the systematic offset between the observed and predicted limb-darkening profiles observed in metal-rich hot-Jupiter systems is also observed for these solar-type stars at lower metallicity. These observations provide additional measurements to explore the impact of magnetic fields on the atmospheres of solar-type stars. We have also used the TESS light curves to make precise estimates of the radius and effective temperature of the M-dwarf companions in these 19 binary systems. We confirm the results from previous studies that find very low mass stars tend to be about 3 per cent larger than predicted by stellar models that use a mixing length prescription calibrated on the Sun.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Stellar Abundances and atmospheric Parameters Pipeline adapted for M dwarfs I. Atmospheric parameters from the spectroscopic module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarfs are important targets in the search for Earth-like exoplanets due to their small masses and low luminosities. Several ongoing and upcoming space missions are targeting M dwarfs for this reason, and the ESA PLATO mission is one of these. In order to fully characterise a planetary system the properties of the host star must be known. For M dwarfs we can derive effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and abundances of various elements from spectroscopic observations in combination with photometric data. The Stellar Abundances and atmospheric Parameters Pipeline (SAPP) has been developed as a prototype for one of the stellar science softwares within the PLATO consortium, it is aimed at FGK stars. We have modified it to be able to analyse the M dwarf among the PLATO targets. The current version of the pipeline for M dwarfs mostly relies on spectroscopic observations. The data processing is based on the machine learning algorithm The Payne and fits a grid of model spectra to an observed spectrum to derive effective temperature and metallicity. We use spectra in the H-band, as the near-infrared region is beneficial for M dwarfs. A method based on synthetic spectra was developed for the continuum normalisation of the spectra, taking into account the pseudo-continuum formed by numerous lines of the water molecule. Photometry is used to constrain the surface gravity. We tested the modified SAPP on spectra of M dwarfs from the APOGEE survey. Our validation sample of 26 stars includes stars with interferometric observations and binaries. We found a good agreement between our values and reference values from a range of studies. The overall uncertainties in the derived effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity is 100 K, 0.1 dex, and 0.15 dex, respectively. We find that the modified SAPP performs well on M dwarfs and identify possible areas of future development.</description>

      <title>First Doppler image and starspot-corrected orbit for $\lambda$ Andromedae: A multifaceted activity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of starspots for the orbital elements of the spotted RS CVn binary $\lambda$ Andromedae ($\lambda$ And) and present an empirical correction. The aim is to obtain a more precise orbital solution that can be used to better study the system's severe orbital-rotational asynchronism. Phase-resolved high-resolution optical spectra were recorded over the course of 522 days in 2021-2022. We employed two facilities with medium and high resolution spectroscopy for the multiple activity analyses. Doppler imaging is used to reconstruct $\lambda$ And's starspots with a high resolution (R= 250 000) and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra. Optimized cross-correlation functions were used to measure precise radial velocities at a level of a few ten's of m/s. The spot-corrected radial velocities enable, on average, a threefold increase in precision of the individual orbital elements. The residual velocity jitter with a full range of 500 m/s is modulated by the rotation period of $\lambda$ And of 54.4$\pm$0.3 days. Our logarithmic gravity from spectrum synthesis of 2.8$\pm$0.2 together with the interferometrically determined stellar radius suggest a most-likely mass of the primary of $\approx$1.4 Msun. The small orbital mass function then implies a secondary mass of just $\approx$0.1 Msun, which is appropriate for an L-class brown dwarf. The Doppler image reconstructs a dominating cool spot with an umbral temperature difference of $\approx$1000 K with respect to the photosphere of 4660 K and is likely surrounded by a moat-like velocity field. Three more weaker spots add to the total surface spottedness, which is up to 25% of the visible surface. Seven optical chromospheric tracers show rotational modulation of their emission line fluxes in phase with the cool spots. This surface configuration appears to have been stable for the 522 days of our observations.</description>

      <title>The orbital parameters of the binary BLAP HD133729 : advantages of the frequency modulation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive all the orbital parameters of the blue large-amplitude pulsator (BLAP) in the binary system HD133729 by exploiting the frequency modulation (FM) method, which is based on the analytical relations between the orbital parameters and a multiplet separated by the orbital frequency in the frequency spectrum of the light curve. Because the FM method uses the entire data through the Fourier transform, it is the most effective use of high-precision photometry data, taken over a long timespan by the TESS space mission, for determining orbital parameters.</description>

      <title>Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe: Multi-viewpoint messengers of the inner heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA/NASA's Solar Orbiter are encounter missions that are currently both in their nominal science phases, venturing closer to the Sun than ever before. These complementary spacecraft are operating together in order to combine in situ measurements of solar wind plasma in the inner heliosphere with high-resolution remote sensing observations of their source regions in the solar atmosphere. This paper highlights the synergetic science that these multi-viewpoint messengers of the inner heliosphere enable and how they are working together to significantly advance our understanding of the physical processes that are important for solar wind formation, the eruption of coronal mass ejections and their space weather effects.</description>

      <title>Then and now: A new look at the eclipse timing variations of hierarchical triple star candidates in the primordial $Kepler$-field, revisited by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we reanalyze the extended ETV curves of the formerly identified triple star candidates and many other $Kepler$ EBs. Besides the confirmations of the former findings and/or the improvements of the triple systems' orbital properties, the extended time-base allows us to identify several new, longer outer period triple systems, and it also makes possible a more detailed study of the dynamical perturbations in the tightest triple stars. We extend the ETV curves of the $Kepler$ triples with those mid-eclipse times which can be deduced from the TESS observations and, moreover, from targeted ground-based follow up observations for a number of the objects. In general, we use the same methods that were applied for the older studies, which are described in the literature. Due to the lower quality of the TESS observations, however, for the fainter systems we average light curves of the EBs for 5-20 consecutive cycles, and thereby calculate `normal' minima from these averaged light curves. In conclusion, we identified 243 hierarchical triple star candidates in the $Kepler$ sample. This sample strongly overlaps our former, nine-year-old sample, confirming the older results, or providing new solutions for 193 systems of the 2016 sample. For the remaining 28 hierarchical triple candidates of that former study, we were unable to find new solutions either because of the disappearance of the eclipses due to orbital plane precession, or due to instrumental reasons. On the other hand, due to the extended time series, we were able to identify 50 new, longer period triple star candidates, as well. We briefly discuss the main properties of each individual system and present statistical studies of the results, as well.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Rotation on Triggering S Doradus Instabilities in Luminous Blue Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous blue variables are an intermediate stage in the evolution of high-mass stars characterized by extreme mass loss and substantial variability. The stars show large irregular episodic variations on timescales of years to decades in these stars' effective temperatures (called "S Dor variations"). Observations show that these variations are triggered when the stars are in a well-defined strip in the HRD that corresponds to the Modified Eddington Limit, where the atmospheric radiation pressure almost balances gravity. In this work we consider the role that rotation plays in the instability that leads to the triggering of S Dor variations in luminous post-main sequence LBVs. We adopt the existing instability criterion that the effective surface gravity is reduced to 10% of the Newtonian gravity due to radiation pressure in the atmosphere of non-rotating stars. We then specifically describe how rotation impacts this instability. By carrying out numerical simulations of model LBVs at both solar and sub-solar metallicities, we confirm that most LBVs should be unstable at both the equator and the poles, and that rotation exacerbates this effect; some models also produce enhanced mass loss at the pole or equator. Our numerical models also predict dense equatorial disks or rings and high-velocity bipolar outflows, in agreement with existing observations of LBV circumstellar nebulae.</description>

      <title>Insights into Solar Wind Flow Speeds from the Coronal Radio occultation Experiment: Findings from the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data collected by the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission in October 2021, we investigated coronal regions of the Sun by analyzing the Doppler spectral width of radio signals to estimate solar wind velocity. A simplified equation is introduced to directly relate these two parameters. The study focuses on observations conducted from October 2 to October 14, 2021, a relatively quiet phase of solar cycle 25. The analysis targeted the coronal region within heliocentric distances of 5-8 RSun, near the ecliptic plane. In this region, solar wind velocities ranged from 100 to 150 kms^-1, while electron densities were on the order of 10^10 m^(-3). We also compared our results with electron density observations and models derived from previous studies. Though the decrease in the electron densities with respect to increasing helio-centric distance matches quite well with the theoretical models, MOM estimates fall at the lower edge of the distribution. This difference may be attributed to the prolonged weak solar activity during the MOM observations, in contrast to prior studies conducted during periods of comparatively higher solar activity in earlier solar cycles.</description>

      <title>Rosette Nebula Outburst Gaia 24djk from the Young Stellar Object V557 Mon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A previously faint young stellar object (YSO), V557 Mon, rapidly brightened in late 2024 and is currently at least $\Delta G=3.3$ magnitudes brighter than its typical pre-outburst brightness. The ongoing outburst is identified in the Gaia Alerts system as Gaia24djk. We obtained a 1-2.5 $\mu$m spectrum of the object and find the spectrum is dominated by line emission and continuum excess consistent with rapid YSO accretion, similar to the star EX Lup during its outburst state. We speculate that the burst, which has not yet reached its peak brightness, may become an FU Ori outburst, which would be evidenced by the emission spectrum turning into an absorption spectrum.</description>

      <title>Comparison of methods used to derive the Galactic star formation history from white dwarf samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare three methods of deriving the local Galactic star formation history, using as a benchmark the Gaia-defined 40 pc white dwarf sample, currently the largest volume complete sample of stellar remnants with medium-resolution spectroscopy. We create a population synthesis model to 1) reproduce the observed white dwarf luminosity function, 2) reproduce the observed absolute Gaia G magnitude distribution, and 3) directly calculate the ages of all individual white dwarfs in the 40 pc volume. We then compare the star formation histories determined from each method. Previous studies using these methods were based on different white dwarf samples and as such were difficult to compare. Uncertainties in each method such as the initial mass function, initial-final mass relation, main sequence lifetimes, stellar metallicity, white dwarf cooling ages and binary evolution are accounted for to estimate the precision and accuracy of each method. We conclude that no method is quantitatively better at determining the star formation history and all three produce star formation histories that agree within uncertainties of current external astrophysical relations.</description>

      <title>Star-crossed Clusters: Asteroseismic Ages for Individual Stars are in Tension with the Ages of their Host Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A meta-analysis of seismic ages determined for individual stars in the well-studied open and globular clusters NGC 6819, NGC 6791, M67, M4, M19, M80, and M9 reveals both high variance across measurements and significant discrepancy with independent, isochrone-based age determinations for the clusters in which these stars reside. The scatter among asteroseismic ages for individual stars in any one of these clusters far surpasses both the absolute age uncertainty computed for reference cluster M92 (5.4\%) and the model-to-model systematic uncertainties in isochrones (roughly 10\%). This suggests that either binary processes are significantly altering the masses of stars in these clusters, or some additional corrections, perhaps as a function of mass, metallicity, or surface gravity, are required to bring the asteroseismic age scale into concordance with ages inferred from isochrone or similar model fitting.</description>

      <title>The role of triple evolution in the formation of LISA double white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarfs will be prominent gravitational-wave sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). While previous studies have primarily focused on formation scenarios in which binaries form and evolve in isolation, we present the first detailed study of the role of triple stellar evolution in forming the population of LISA double white dwarfs. In this work, we present the first detailed study of the role of triple stellar evolution in forming the population of LISA double white dwarfs. We use the multiple stellar evolution code (MSE) to model the stellar evolution, binary interactions, and the dynamics of triple star systems then use a Milky Way-like galaxy from the TNG50 simulations to construct a representative sample of LISA double white dwarfs. In our simulations about $7\times10^6$ Galactic double white dwarfs in the LISA frequency bandwidth originate from triple systems, whereas $\sim4\times10^6$ form from isolated binary stars. The properties of double white dwarfs formed in triples closely resemble those formed from isolated binaries, but we also find a small number of systems $\sim\mathcal{O}(10)$ that reach extreme eccentricities $(&gt;0.9)$, a feature unique to the dynamical formation channels. Our population produces $\approx 10^{4} $ individually resolved double white dwarfs (from triple and binary channels) and an unresolved stochastic foreground below the level of the LISA instrumental noise. About $57\,\%$ of double white dwarfs from triple systems retain a bound third star when entering the LISA frequency bandwidth. However, we expect the tertiary stars to be too distant to have a detectable imprint in the gravitational-wave signal of the inner binary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the distances of stellar systems classified as cataclysmic variables in the literature were determined by using the distance compiled from Bailer-Jones et al. (2021). The spatial distributions of cataclysmic variables in the heliocentric Galactic coordinate system are obtained and their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram constructed from Gaia colors are discussed.</description>

      <title>The EXO-UV program: lastest advances of experimental studies to investigate the biological impact of UV radiation on exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EXO-UV program is an international, interdisciplinary collaboration between astrophysicists and biologists aimed at expanding the characterization of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) environments on exoplanets. This approach combines astrophysical studies with biological experiments to better understand the potential impacts of UVR on exoplanetary surfaces. UVR is particularly relevant because it reaches the surface of planets and can influence their habitability. The specific wavelengths within the UVR spectrum depend on the planet's atmospheric composition and the spectral energy distribution of its host star. Additionally, high UVR fluxes emitted during flares and superflares are of particular interest due to the limited information available regarding their biological impact. The EXO-UV program has successfully led to the first experimental study examining the biological effects of high UVR fluences, such as those produced by flares and superflares. Future experimental studies aim to investigate the biological effects of repetitive flares. In this paper, we review the latest results from our EXO-UV program.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XVII - Census and lifetime of high-mass prestellar cores in 14 massive protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-mass prestellar cores are extremely rare. The search for such objects has long been hindered by small sample sizes, leading to large uncertainties in their lifetimes and the conditions in which high-mass stars ($&gt; 8\,M_{\odot}$) form. We leverage the large sample ($\sim 580$ cores) detected in the ALMA-IMF survey to identify both protostellar and prestellar cores and estimate their relative lifetimes. We use CO and SiO outflows to identify protostellar cores and introduce a new automated method based on aperture line emission and background subtraction to systematically detect outflows associated with each of the 141 most massive cores. Massive cores that do not drive an outflow in either tracer are classified as prestellar. Our method enables efficient outflow detection with performance comparable to more traditional techniques. We identify 30 likely prestellar cores with $M &gt; 8\,M_{\odot}$, including 12 with $M &gt; 16\,M_{\odot}$, the best candidates for high-mass star precursors. Most of these 12 cores reside in the crowded central regions of protoclusters, where high-mass stars are expected to form. Using prestellar-to-protostellar core ratios and a 300 kyr protostellar lifetime, we estimate prestellar lifetimes of 120 to 240 kyr for $8\,M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 16\,M_{\odot}$ and 50 to 100 kyr for $30\,M_{\odot} &lt; M &lt; 55\,M_{\odot}$. These timescales, which depend on different mass reservoir evolution scenarios, significantly exceed the 4 to 15 kyr free-fall time of the cores, suggesting that high-mass cores persist for 10 to 30 free-fall times. This indicates that collapse is slowed by turbulence, magnetic fields, or rotation at or below the observed scale.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Detection of a 2.9-hour Orbit in a Long Period Radio Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long Period radio Transients (LPTs) are a mysterious new class of radio transients pulsating on periods of minutes to hours. So far, eight LPTs have been discovered predominantly at low Galactic latitudes, yet their nature remains unknown. Here, I present the first phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the 2.9-h LPT GLEAM-X J0704-37, acquired with the 10-m Keck I telescope. Radial velocity (RV) shifts of $189\pm 3 \textrm{km s}^{-1}$ of an M5-type star in a binary system are detected on a period nearly equal to the radio period. Weak H$\alpha$ emission is also present, with some of it possibly originating from outside of the M dwarf. Based on the RV amplitude, and assuming a typical M dwarf mass, the companion mass must be $M \geq 0.22 M_\odot$. Calibrating the spectra with space-based \textit{Gaia} photometry reveals that the system is nearly four times closer than previously reported, at $d \approx 400$ pc, suggesting that more systems could be nearby and amenable to optical characterization. The optical spectrum between 3500-10,000 Angstrom is well modeled by a binary comprised of a massive white dwarf (WD; $T_\textrm{eff}\approx$7,300 K, $M\approx0.8-1.0M_\odot$) and M dwarf ($T_\textrm{eff}\approx$3,000 K, $M\approx0.14M_\odot$). Radio pulses arrive when the WD is at nearly maximum blueshift and the M dwarf at nearly maximum redshift, in contrast to what has been reported in a similar LPT, ILT J1101+5521. GLEAM-X J0704-37 is now the second LPT with an orbital period nearly equal to the radio period, hinting at two classes of LPTs: ``long LPTs'' ($P\gtrsim$78 min) associated with WD + M dwarf binary orbits, and ``short LPTs'' ($P\lesssim$78 min) related to WD or neutron star spins. This work demonstrates that precise localization of LPTs, which enables optical follow-up, will be key in uncovering the mechanism(s) that power this new class of phenomenon.</description>

      <title>An assessment of observational coverage and gaps for robust Sun to heliosphere integrated science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the generation and development of the continuous outflow from the Sun requires tracing the physical conditions from deep in the corona to the heliosphere. Detailed global observations of plasma state variables and the magnetic field are needed to provide critical constraints to the underlying physics driving models of the corona and solar wind. Key diagnostics of the solar wind require measurements at its formation site and during its outflow to continuously track it across rapidly changing regions of space. A unified view of the solar wind is only possible through coordinated remote and in situ observations that probe these different regions. Here, we discuss current observational coverage and gaps of different plasma properties and review recent coordinated studies. We highlight how these efforts may become more routine with the launch of upcoming and planned missions.</description>

      <title>Spin evolution and mass distribution of the Galactic Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have the total masses distributing narrowly around $\sim2.6-2.7M_\odot$, while the BNS merger GW190425 detected via gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass ($\sim3.4M_\odot$). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper, we investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution model and its effects on the BNS observability, with implementation of various relevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star component in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the accretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can be comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have substantially shorter radio lifetime than the low-mass BNSs, and thus smaller probability being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and metal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the survived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis model and find that their distributions on the diagrams of spin period versus spin-period-time-derivative ($P-\dot{P}$) and orbital period versus eccentricity ($P_{\rm orb}-e$) can well match those of the observed Galactic BNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be matched by the model. A significant fraction ($\sim19\%-22\%$) of merging BNSs at redshift $z\sim0$ have masses $\gtrsim3M_\odot$, which seems compatible with the GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic BNSs, which will put strong constraint on the spin evolution of BNSs during their formation processes.</description>
