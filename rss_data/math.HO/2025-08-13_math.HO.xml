      <title>One Plus One Equals Two Ones: On Identity, Aggregation, and Counting</title>

Abstract: A childhood observation of Thakur Anukulchandra that "one and one can only be two ones, not simply two" motivates a precise inquiry: what, exactly, is asserted when we pass from two concrete individuals to the numeral "2"? This paper does not challenge the arithmetic theorem 1+1=2, but rather analyzes what this equation means when applied to physical objects. We answer with two complementary, rigorous treatments. Mathematician's proof. We model aggregation by the free commutative monoid of multisets M(U) over a universe of individuals U, so that delta_a + delta_b literally encodes two ones with individuality preserved. Numerals arise only after a declared classification q:U-&gt;T (coarse-graining) via the pushforward q*:M(U)-&gt;M(T) and the unique counting homomorphism to N. The non-injectivity of q* isolates the exact locus of information loss. Physicist's proof. We represent physical systems by worldtubes, states, and observables, and define a composite operation that preserves labelled constituents. We prove the Non-Identity Addition Theorem: A+B = X+X iff A=B=X; hence a pair of distinct objects cannot equal a doubled copy. The numeral "2" appears only as the readout of a typed count observable after an explicit classification, not as a statement of physical identity. Conclusion. In reality, one plus one is two ones; "1+1=2" is the value of a counting map applied after coarse graining. This clarifies the separation between identity-preserving aggregation and counting, reconciles everyday arithmetic with physical non-identity, and makes explicit the modeling choice that every act of counting entails. Our analysis has implications for the philosophy of mathematics, measurement theory, and information theoretic approaches to classification.</description>
