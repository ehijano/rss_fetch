      <title>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma models (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase are studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations with finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Chern bands and Landau levels from projected Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a universal formulation of the generalized real space interactions with translational invariance, when projected into a single Landau level, can be equivalent to density-density interaction projected into any Chern bands (e.g. Landau levels, continuous moire Chern bands and discrete lattice Chern bands). By constructing a complete basis of generalized pseudopotentials, we define the projected interaction range that can be used to characterize important features of different Chern bands relevant to the robustness of interacting topological phases. The analytical construction allows us to study general Chern bands beyond the torus geometry, for example on the disk or spherical geometry where the edge dynamics and curvature effects can be explored. For moire systems (and lattice Chern bands with large incompressibility gap) one can see transparently the topological Hall viscosity for the fractional states are identical to those in the Landau levels. The physical unprojected interaction also provides a natural embedding for lattice systems, shedding light on the concerns of relying on quantum geometric tensor (varying with lattice embedding in real space) to understand the properties of interacting phases of matters.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Network Study of the Roughening Transition in (2 + 1)D lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the confined phase of (2+1)D lattice gauge theories a roughening transition arises between a weakly confined regime with floppy string excitations and a strongly confined regime with stiff string excitations. In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Spectroscopy of Chiral Charge Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic interactions can give rise to novel charge density waves with unconventional ground states. Recent experiments report evidence for a chiral charge density wave (CDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb or Cs). Theoretical analyses propose a topologically nontrivial loop current phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry as the favorable CDW ground state. However, spectroscopic insights into the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds are still missing and conflicting experimental results question the presence of a loop current phase. We employed individual magnetic atoms as local quantum sensors to examine the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Our spectroscopic measurements show that the magnetic moment of Co induces a spatially-localized low-energy state in the CDW phase. The distinct spectral signatures of this state are consistent with theoretical expectations for the quasiparticle excitation of a loop current order parameter, while control experiment rule out alternative scenario. Our work provides unique insights into the ground state of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and introduces a novel method to examine other topological states, such as the fractional Chern insulators, with the STM.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.</description>

      <title>Realizing a topological diode effect on the surface of a topological Kondo insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing the concept of topology into material science has sparked a revolution from classic electronic and optoelectronic devices to topological quantum devices. The latter has potential for transferring energy and information with unprecedented efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a topological diode effect on the surface of a three-dimensional material, SmB6, a candidate topological Kondo insulator. The diode effect is evidenced by pronounced rectification and photogalvanic effects under electromagnetic modulation and radiation at radio frequency. Our experimental results and modeling suggest that these prominent effects are intimately tied to the spatially inhomogeneous formation of topological surface states (TSS) at the intermediate temperature. This work provides a manner of breaking the mirror symmetry (in addition to the inversion symmetry), resulting in the formation of pn-junctions between puddles of metallic TSS. This effect paves the way for efficient current rectifiers or energy-harvesting devices working down to radio frequency range at low temperature, which could be extended to high temperatures using other topological insulators with large bulk gap.</description>

      <title>Floquet control of topological phases and Hall effects in Z2 nodal line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic control of topological properties in materials is central to modern condensed matter physics, and Floquet engineering, utilizing periodic light fields, provides a promising avenue. Here, we use Floquet theory to theoretically study the topological response of a Z2 nodal line semimetal (NLSM) when driven by circularly polarized light (CPL). We demonstrate that the direction of CPL irradiation critically dictates the resulting topological phase transitions. Specifically, when light is incident perpendicular to the nodal line plane, increasing the light amplitude induces two successive topological phase transitions: first, from the Z2 NLSM to a vortex NLSM, a rare and intriguing topological state; and second, a transition from the vortex NLSM to a semimetal with a pair of Weyl points (WPs). In stark contrast, irradiation along other directions directly transforms the Z2 nodal line into a pair of WPs. We further investigate the transport properties of the Floquet Z2 NLSM, focusing on the anomalous and planar Hall effects. The anomalous Hall effect exhibits a direction-dependent amplitude variation, deviating from conventional two-band NLSM behavior. Importantly, we reveal a significant and tunable planar Hall effect, a phenomenon largely unexplored in Floquet topological materials, which is highly sensitive to both light amplitude and direction. Our findings not only present a novel route to realize the vortex NLSM, but also establish an efficient way to control Hall transport phenomena in Z2 NLSMs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in a trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the first-order perturbation theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal basis approach to fractional Chern physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fractional Chern insulator is thought to emerge from the competition between one-particle band topology and strong repulsive interactions. As an attempt to study lattice models of fractional Chern insulators, we introduce a biorthogonal basis constructed from coherent-like states on the von Neumann lattice. Focusing on the fact that this basis is diagonal to the vortex attachment in the infinite-volume limit, we convert the original fermions into composite fermions by applying a two-dimensional Jordan-Wigner transformation to the creation and annihilation operators of the biorthogonal basis. Furthermore, we apply the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation to handle the interaction Hamiltonian of composite fermions. Due to the biorthogonal nature, the representation of the new Hamiltonian is no longer Hermitian, which implies that the introduction of the approximation does not guarantee the reality of the energy spectrum. In fact, there are many self-consistent solutions with complex spectra. Nevertheless, we numerically find that it is possible to construct a self-consistent solution where the band dispersion is nearly real and the ground-state energy is lower than in other solutions.</description>

      <title>Automated evaluation of imaginary time strong coupling diagrams by sum-of-exponentials hybridization fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation on Herbertsmithite: exchange interactions including extra-plane magnetic impurities, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and anisotropic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed ab initio evaluation of the isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions of Herbertsmithite is presented. This compound crystallizes in a so-called Kagome lattice and the S=1/2 spin structure is not fully resolved despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies. The present study not only focusses on the leading in-plane nearest neighbor isotropic interactions, but also other less well studied interactions such as the anisotropic exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. The anisotropic exchange is very weak, but the DM interactions are sizeable with a strong in-plane component, typically obviated in model studies. Moreover, it is shown that the extra-plane magnetic impurities have a non-negligible interaction with the regular in-plane magnetic sites. Combined with an estimated occurrence of these magnetic impurities of ~15%, the present results indicate that two-dimensional magnetic models only describe part of the physics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Pair Density Wave Order Across a Lifshitz Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the telltale signs of pair-density-wave order (PDW) in the Kondo-Heisenberg chain by focusing on the momentum resolved spectrum in different parameter regimes. Density matrix renormalization group calculations reveal that this phase is characterized by a dispersion with two minima and four Fermi points, indicating the emergence of an effective next-nearest-neighbor hopping that arises as a second-order effect to avoid magnetic frustration. The pairs appear in the spectrum as in-gap bound states with weight concentrated in the hole pockets. The low-energy physics can be understood by means of a generalized $t-J$ model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results offer a guide for searching for experimental signatures, and for other models that can realize PDW physics.</description>

      <title>Single-band Triangular Lattice Hubbard Model with Tunable Anisotropy from Twisted Diamond Homobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground-state properties of the single-band triangular lattice Hubbard model with hopping anisotropy and strong interactions remain elusive so far. Here we show that twisted diamond homobilayers with band extrema at $Y$ valley can realize weakly-coupled chains with quasi-1D band structure; applying displacement field generates interchain hopping, transforming this quasi-1D system into a 2D one. The low-energy physics can be described by localized Wannier functions on the triangular lattice with tunable hopping anisotropy, providing a promising platform for studying the anisotropic triangular lattice Hubbard model. We further employ density matrix renormalization group to study this model with interaction $U=10t$ and anisotropy $0.5\leq t'/t\leq 1.5$ at half filling, and obtain a rich ground state phase diagram, including a chiral spin liquid phase, non-magnetic phases, and a N\'eel antiferromagnetic phase. This work provides a first realization of displacement-field tuned anisotropy in a single-band triangular Hubbard model within moir\'e systems, establishing them as a promising platform to investigate intriguing correlated physics with tunable anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Neodymium ions as charge reservoir in NdNiO$_2$: from lack of long range order to electron-doping-induced antiferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnetism in the electron-doped infinite-layer nickelate NdNiO$_2$. We perform an unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculation for a tight-binding model which contains both nickel and neodymium orbitals. We reproduce the self-doping effect, which is the escape of charge onto the neodymium bands. By fixing all free parameters to realistic values we find that undoped NdNiO$_2$ lies right {\it outside} the antiferromagnetic (AFM) region of the phase diagram. This is consistent with experiments, which find no long-range order in the ground state of NdNiO$_2$, yet see short-range AFM correlations and broad magnetic excitations. Finally, we find that the self-doping effect leads to a dramatic increase in the stability of the AFM solution upon electron doping -- a behavior that is strikingly different from what is, for instance, observed in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>A Recipe for Flat Bands in Pyrochlore Materials: A Chemist's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials in which atoms are arranged in a pyrochlore lattice have found renewed interest, as, at least theoretically, orbitals on those lattices can form flat bands. However, real materials often do not behave according to theoretical models, which is why there has been a dearth of pyrochlore materials exhibiting flat band physics. Here we examine the conditions under which ideal 'pyrochlore bands' can exist in real materials and how to have those close to the Fermi level. We find that the simple model used in the literature does not apply to the bands at the Fermi level in real pyrochlore materials. However, surprisingly, certain oxide compounds which have oxygen orbitals inside the pyrochlore tetrahedra do exhibit near-ideal pyrochlore bands near the Fermi level. We explain this observation by a generalized tight-binding model including the oxygen orbitals. We further classify all known pyrochlore materials based on their crystal structure, band structure, and chemical characteristics and propose materials to study in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Interplay of canted antiferromagnetism and nematic order in Mott insulating Sr2Ir1-xRhxO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sr2IrO4 is one of the prime candidates for realizing exotic quantum spin orders owing to the subtle combination of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. Sensitive local magnetization measurement can serve as a powerful tool to study these kinds of systems with multiple competing spin orders since the comprehensive study of the spatially-varying magnetic responses provide crucial information of their energetics. Here, using sensitive magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements and spin Hamiltonian model calculations, we show that Sr2IrO4 has non-trivial domain structures which cannot be understood by conventional antiferromagnetism. This unconventional magnetic response exhibits broken symmetry along the Ir-O-Ir bond direction and is enhanced upon spin-flip transition or Rh-doping. Our analysis, based on possible stacking patterns of spins, shows that introduction of an additional rotational-symmetry breaking is essential to describe the magnetic behavior of Sr2Ir1-xRhxO4, providing strong evidence for a nematic hidden order phase in this highly correlated spin-orbit Mott insulator.</description>

      <title>ER=EPR and Strange Metals from Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a strange metal emerges from the long-range quantum entanglements. Given that the quenched average of a spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and critical bosons results in linear-$T$ resistivity, we first calculate the annealed average of the model and find that it also give the linear resistivity. We then observe that the correlator of the 'coupling field' in quenched average can be interpreted as the wormholes that connect pair of points separated by arbitrary distance, while the annealed average can be interpreted as a pure system without disorder having quantum entanglements between the connected pairs. We show that, in the large-$N$ limit, two averages are equivalent. Therefore we suggest that this equivalence provides insight to the precise meaning of $ER=EPR$ conjecture in the context of an explicit model with well defined computation. Also, we point out that the wormhole picture clarifies why a SYK-rized model describes the strongly interacting system even in the case the averaged coupling strength is tiny.</description>

      <title>Low-Moment Semiconducting Properties of Quaternary Heusler Alloy CoRuTiSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate structural, magnetic and transport properties of CoRuTiSn equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy. CoRuTiSn was synthesized by arc-melt technique. The room temperature powder XRD pattern was analyzed, and it was found that CoRuTiSn has a tetragonal crystal structure. Magnetic measurements show non-zero but small hysteresis indicating CoRuTiSn as a soft ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of ~200 K. The magnetic moment determined from magnetization data is found to be 0.84 {\mu}B/f.u. at 4 K, which is close to the value, calculated using first principles calculations. Electrical resistivity decreases with temperatures, indicating semiconducting nature of CoRuTiSn. Hall effect measurements show anomalous behavior, consistent with the ferromagnetic nature of the sample. The low moment ferromagnetic semiconducting nature of CoRuTiSn could make this material promising for semiconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity quadrupole order and induced nonreciprocal transport in the kagome metal CsTi3Bi5 driven by quantum interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome metals present a fascinating platform of quantum phases thanks to the interplay between the geometric frustration and strong electron correlation. Here, we propose the emergence of the electric odd-parity bond order (BO) that originates from the intra-unit-cell odd-parity configuration in recently discovered kagome metal CsTi3Bi5. The predicted E1u BO is induced by the beyond- mean-field mechanism, that is, the quantum interference among different sublattice spin fluctuations. Importantly, the accompanied nematic deformation of the Fermi surface is just ~1% while the intensity of the quasiparticle interference signal exhibits drastic nematic anisotropy, consistent with the scanning tunneling microscope measurements in CsTi3Bi5. The present odd-parity BO triggers interesting phenomena, such as the non-linear Hall effect and emergent electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among present quantum many-body computational methods, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is one of the most promising approaches for dealing with large-scale complex systems. It has played an extremely important role in understanding quantum many-body physics. However, two dark clouds, namely the sign problem and general measurement issues, have seriously hampered its scope of application. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{O} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{Oe^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and time. Essentially, this scheme solves the long-standing problem of calculating the overlap between different distribution functions in mathematical statistics, which can be widely used in statistical problems, such as quantum many-body computation, big data and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization and conceptual barriers in variational finite Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Tunneling Spectroscopy of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong interaction between electrons in two-dimensional systems in the presence of a high magnetic field gives rise to fractional quantum Hall states that host quasiparticles with fractional charge and fractional exchange statistics. Here, we demonstrate high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of fractional quantum Hall states in ultra clean Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene devices. Spectroscopy measurements show sharp excitations that have been predicted to emerge when electrons fractionalize into bound states of quasiparticles. We find energy gaps for candidate non-abelian fractional states that are larger by a factor of five than other related systems - for example semiconductor heterostructures - and this suggests bilayer graphene is an ideal platform for the manipulation of these quasiparticles and for the creation of a topological quantum bit. We also find previously unobserved fractional states in our very clean graphene samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a superselection theory of symmetry defects in 2+1D symmetry enriched topological (SET) order in the infinite volume setting. For a finite symmetry group $G$ with a unitary on-site action, our formalism produces a $G$-crossed braided tensor category $G\mathsf{Sec}$. This superselection theory is a direct generalization of the usual superselection theory of anyons, and thus is consistent with this standard analysis in the trivially graded component $G\mathsf{Sec}_1$. This framework also gives us a completely rigorous understanding of symmetry fractionalization. To demonstrate the utility of our formalism, we compute $G\mathsf{Sec}$ explicitly in both short-range and long-range entangled spin systems with symmetry and recover the relevant skeletal data.</description>

      <title>A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Transmon qutrit-based simulation of spin-1 AKLT systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths, and hence the noise, when the system of interest has local dimension of three. Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a straightforward hardware realization of three-level systems, or qutrits, useful for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate pulse gates to a low error rate to obtain transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy, and Tasaki) which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena such as topologically protected ground states, string order and the existence of a robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. We further present scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase, and use tensor network simulations to establish the advantage of qutrit-based implementation over qubit-based ones in the presence of noise. Our work provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological phases of matter.</description>
