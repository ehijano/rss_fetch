      <title>Embedding Economic Input-Output Models in Systems of Systems: An MBSE and Hetero-functional Graph Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the interdependent nature of Anthropocene systems of systems is fundamental to making informed decisions to address challenges across complex ecological, environmental, and coupled human-natural systems. This paper presents the first application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT) to economic systems, establishing a scalable and extensible methodology for integrating economic input-output (EIO) models within a unified system-of-systems modeling framework. Integrating EIO models into the MBSE-HFGT workflow demonstrates how the structural form and function of economic systems can be expressed through SysML's graphical ontology and subsequently translated into the computational structure of HFGT. Using a synthetic Rectangular Choice of Technology (RCOT) example as a pedagogical foundation, the study confirms that the dynamics captured by basic EIO models, as well as other complex economic models grounded in EIO theory, can be equivalently reproduced within the MBSE-HFGT framework. The integration with MBSE and HFGT thus preserves analytical precision while offering enhanced graphical clarity and system-level insight through a shared ontological structure. By integrating modeling languages and mathematical frameworks, the proposed methodology establishes a foundation for knowledge co-production and integrated decision-making to address the multifaceted sustainability challenges associated with Anthropocene systems of systems.</description>

      <title>State Feedback Control of State-Delayed LPV Systems using Dynamics IQCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a new control framework for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems with time-varying state delays by integrating parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions with integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A novel delay-dependent state-feedback controller structure is proposed, consisting of a linear state-feedback law augmented with an additional term that captures the delay-dependent dynamics of the plant. Closed-loop stability and $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain performance are analyzed using dynamic IQCs and parameter-dependent quadratic Lyapunov functions, leading to convex synthesis conditions that guarantee performance in terms of parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Unlike traditional delay control approaches, the proposed IQC-based framework provides a flexible and systematic methodology for handling delay effects, enabling enhanced control capability, reduced conservatism, and improved closed-loop performance.</description>

      <title>Noncooperative Coordination for Decentralized Air Traffic Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized air traffic management requires coordination among self-interested stakeholders operating under shared safety and capacity constraints, where conventional centralized or implicitly cooperative models do not adequately capture this setting. We develop a unified perspective on noncooperative coordination, in which system-level outcomes emerge by designing incentives and assigning signals that reshape individual optimality rather than imposing cooperation or enforcement. We advance this framework along three directions: scalable equilibrium engineering via reduced-rank and uncertainty-aware correlated equilibria, decentralized mechanism design for equilibrium selection without enforcement, and structured noncooperative dynamics with convergence guarantees. Beyond these technical contributions, we discuss core design principles that govern incentive-compatible coordination in decentralized systems. Together, these results establish a foundation for scalable, robust coordination in safety-critical air traffic systems.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning LLMs to Generate Economical and Reliable Actions for the Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) force rapid topology changes that can render standard operating points infeasible, requiring operators to quickly identify corrective transmission switching actions that reduce load shedding while maintaining acceptable voltage behavior. We present a verifiable, multi-stage adaptation pipeline that fine-tunes an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) to generate \emph{open-only} corrective switching plans from compact PSPS scenario summaries under an explicit switching budget. First, supervised fine-tuning distills a DC-OPF MILP oracle into a constrained action grammar that enables reliable parsing and feasibility checks. Second, direct preference optimization refines the policy using AC-evaluated preference pairs ranked by a voltage-penalty metric, injecting voltage-awareness beyond DC imitation. Finally, best-of-$N$ selection provides an inference-time addition by choosing the best feasible candidate under the target metric. On IEEE 118-bus PSPS scenarios, fine-tuning substantially improves DC objective values versus zero-shot generation, reduces AC power-flow failure from 50\% to single digits, and improves voltage-penalty outcomes on the common-success set. Code and data-generation scripts are released to support reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Generalized bilinear Koopman realization from input-output data for multi-step prediction with metaheuristic optimization of lifting function and its application to real-world industrial system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an input-output bilinear Koopman realization with an optimization algorithm of lifting functions. For nonlinear systems with inputs, Koopman-based modeling is effective because the Koopman operator enables a high-dimensional linear representation of nonlinear dynamics. However, traditional approaches face significant challenges in industrial applications. Measuring all system states is often impractical due to constraints on sensor installation. Moreover, the predictive performance of a Koopman model strongly depends on the choice of lifting functions, and their design typically requires substantial manual effort. In addition, although a linear time-invariant (LTI) Koopman model is the most commonly used model structure in the Koopman framework, such model exhibit limited predictive accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an input-output bilinear Koopman modeling in which the design parameters of radial basis function (RBF)-based lifting functions are optimized using a global metaheuristic algorithm to improve long-term prediction performance. Consideration of the long-term prediction performance enhances the reliability of the resulting model. The proposed methodology is validated in simulations and experimental tests, with the airpath control system of a diesel engine as the plant to be modeled. This plant represents a challenging industrial application because it exhibits strong nonlinearities and coupled multi-input multi-output (MIMO) dynamics. These results demonstrate that the proposed input-output bilinear Koopman model significantly outperforms traditional linear Koopman models in predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>The role of VSG parameters in shaping small-signal SG dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a small-signal transfer function for a system comprising a virtual synchronous generator (VSG), a synchronous generator (SG), and a load, capturing voltage and frequency dynamics. Using this model, we analyze the sensitivity of SG dynamics to VSG parameters, highlighting trade-offs in choosing virtual inertia and governor lag, the limited effect of damper-winding emulation, and several others.</description>

      <title>Time-Certified and Efficient NMPC via Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying and accelerating execution times of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) implementations are two core requirements. Execution-time certificate guarantees that the NMPC controller returns a solution before the next sampling time, and achieving faster worst-case and average execution times further enables its use in a wider set of applications. However, NMPC produces a nonlinear program (NLP) for which it is challenging to derive its execution time certificates. Our previous works, \citep{wu2025direct,wu2025time} provide data-independent execution time certificates (certified number of iterations) for box-constrained quadratic programs (BoxQP). To apply the time-certified BoxQP algorithm \citep{wu2025time} for state-input constrained NMPC, this paper i) learns a linear model via Koopman operator; ii) proposes a dynamic-relaxation construction approach yields a structured BoxQP rather than a general QP; iii) exploits the structure of BoxQP, where the dimension of the linear system solved in each iteration is reduced from $5N(n_u+n_x)$ to $Nn_u$ (where $n_u, n_x, N$ denote the number of inputs, states, and length of prediction horizon), yielding substantial speedups (when $n_x \gg n_u$, as in PDE control).</description>

      <title>Venting and Outgassing Simulations of Pressurized Lunar Modules: Contamination of the Lunar Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One objective of Artemis science is to determine the impact human activities have on the lunar environment, which might compromise science objectives and measurements. We perform a preliminary analysis of the contamination associated with airlock venting and outgassing from a prototype lunar-module geometry intended to host astronauts on the lunar surface. The air flow generated by the depressurization of the airlock, expanding in the lunar exosphere, is studied using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for two different venting configurations and the particle flux on the surface is computed as a function of the distance from the the module. Outgassing from the main body of the module -- assumed to be covered with a Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) blanketing -- and from the solar panels is then analyzed using a view-factor method, employing outgassing rates from the literature.Our results give preliminary indications of the distance at which contamination levels fall below the values characteristic of native species in the lunar atmosphere. Scientific measurements targeting 40Ar should be carried farther than 30--100 meters from the module, while the detection of lower-abundance species such as polar-crater water might require to travel up to and beyond 3 km from the module.</description>

      <title>Secure High-Resolution ISAC via Multi-Layer Intelligent Metasurfaces: A Layered Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless networks, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing. However, existing ISAC systems face fundamental limitations in achieving high-resolution sensing while maintaining robust communication security and spectral efficiency. This paper introduces a transformative approach leveraging stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) to overcome these challenges. We propose a multi-functional SIM-assisted system that jointly optimizes communication secrecy and sensing accuracy through a novel layered optimization framework. Our solution employs a multi-objective optimization formulation that balances secrecy rate maximization with sensing error minimization under practical hardware constraints. The proposed layered block coordinate descent algorithm efficiently coordinates sensing configuration, secure beamforming, communication metasurface optimization, and resource allocation while ensuring robustness to channel uncertainties. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional approaches, achieving 32-61\% improvement in sensing accuracy and 15-35\% enhancement in secrecy rates while maintaining computational efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm for secure and high-precision multi-functional wireless systems.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Bayesian Prediction Techniques for Mobile Robot Trajectory Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a performance comparison of different estimation and prediction techniques applied to the problem of tracking multiple robots. The main performance criteria are the magnitude of the estimation or prediction error, the computational effort and the robustness of each method to non-Gaussian noise. Among the different techniques compared are the well known Kalman filters and their different variants (e.g. extended and unscented), and the more recent techniques relying on Sequential Monte Carlo Sampling methods, such as particle filters and Gaussian Mixture Sigma Point Particle Filter.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Feedback Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems with Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents an approach to the construction of stabilizing feedback for strongly nonlinear systems. The class of systems of interest includes systems with drift which are affine in control and which cannot be stabilized by continuous state feedback. The approach is independent of the selection of a Lyapunov type function, but requires the solution of a nonlinear programming 'satisficing problem' stated in terms of the logarithmic coordinates of flows. As opposed to other approaches, point-to-point steering is not required to achieve asymptotic stability. Instead, the flow of the controlled system is required to intersect periodically a certain reachable set in the space of the logarithmic coordinates.</description>

      <title>Scenario Approach with Post-Design Certification of User-Specified Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scenario approach is an established data-driven design framework that comes equipped with a powerful theory linking design complexity to generalization properties. In this approach, data are simultaneously used both for design and for certifying the design's reliability, without resorting to a separate test dataset. This paper takes a step further by guaranteeing additional properties, useful in post-design usage but not considered during the design phase. To this end, we introduce a two-level framework of appropriateness: baseline appropriateness, which guides the design process, and post-design appropriateness, which serves as a criterion for a posteriori evaluation. We provide distribution-free upper bounds on the risk of failing to meet the post-design appropriateness; these bounds are computable without using any additional test data. Under additional assumptions, lower bounds are also derived. As part of an effort to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology, the paper presents two practical examples in H2 and pole-placement problems. Moreover, a method is provided to infer comprehensive distributional knowledge of relevant performance indexes from the available dataset.</description>

      <title>Estimating Human Muscular Fatigue in Dynamic Collaborative Robotic Tasks with Learning-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing human muscle fatigue is critical for optimizing performance and safety in physical human-robot interaction(pHRI). This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.</description>

      <title>Controlled oscillation modeling using port-Hamiltonian neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems through purely data-driven methods is challenging as they do not learn the underlying conservation laws that enable them to correctly generalize. Existing port-Hamiltonian neural network methods have recently been successfully applied for modeling mechanical systems. However, even though these methods are designed on power-balance principles, they usually do not consider power-preserving discretizations and often rely on Runge-Kutta numerical methods. In this work, we propose to use a second-order discrete gradient method embedded in the learning of dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks. Numerical results are provided for three systems deliberately selected to span different ranges of dynamical behavior under control: a baseline harmonic oscillator with quadratic energy storage; a Duffing oscillator, with a non-quadratic Hamiltonian offering amplitude-dependent effects; and a self-sustained oscillator, which can stabilize in a controlled limit cycle through the incorporation of a nonlinear dissipation. We show how the use of this discrete gradient method outperforms the performance of a Runge-Kutta method of the same order. Experiments are also carried out to compare two theoretically equivalent port-Hamiltonian systems formulations and to analyze the impact of regularizing the Jacobian of port-Hamiltonian neural networks during training.</description>

      <title>Service Orchestration in the Computing Continuum: Structural Challenges and Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Computing Continuum (CC) integrates different layers of processing infrastructure, from Edge to Cloud, to optimize service quality through ubiquitous and reliable computation. Compared to central architectures, however, heterogeneous and dynamic infrastructure increases the complexity for service orchestration. To guide research, this article first summarizes structural problems of the CC, and then, envisions an ideal solution for autonomous service orchestration across the CC. As one instantiation, we show how Active Inference, a concept from neuroscience, can support self-organizing services in continuously interpreting their environment to optimize service quality. Still, we conclude that no existing solution achieves our vision, but that research on service orchestration faces several structural challenges. Most notably: provide standardized simulation and evaluation environments for comparing the performance of orchestration mechanisms. Together, the challenges outline a research roadmap toward resilient and scalable service orchestration in the CC.</description>

      <title>Perceptive Humanoid Parkour: Chaining Dynamic Human Skills via Motion Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent advances in humanoid locomotion have achieved stable walking on varied terrains, capturing the agility and adaptivity of highly dynamic human motions remains an open challenge. In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive data-driven model order reduction for circuits based on Hammerstein architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that system identification techniques can provide a basis for effective, non-intrusive model order reduction (MOR) for common circuits that are key building blocks in microelectronics. Our approach is motivated by the practical operation of these circuits and utilizes a canonical Hammerstein architecture. To demonstrate the approach we develop parsimonious Hammerstein models for a nonlinear CMOS differential amplifier and an operational amplifier circuit. We train these models on a combination of direct current (DC) and transient Spice circuit simulation data using a novel sequential strategy to identify their static nonlinear and linear dynamical parts. Simulation results show that the Hammerstein model is an effective surrogate for for these types of circuits that accurately and efficiently reproduces their behavior over a wide range of operating points and input frequencies.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Multimodal Transit Frequency and Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Size with Hybrid Metaheuristic and Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) bring competition to traditional transit services but redesigning multimodal transit network can utilize SAVs as feeders to enhance service efficiency and coverage. This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reachability Analysis for Piecewise Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid systems play a crucial role in modeling real-world applications where discrete and continuous dynamics interact, including autonomous vehicles, power systems, and traffic networks. Safety verification for these systems requires determining whether system states can enter unsafe regions under given initial conditions and uncertainties, a question directly addressed by reachability analysis. However, hybrid systems present unique difficulties because their state space is divided into multiple regions with distinct dynamic models, causing traditional data-driven methods to produce inadequate over-approximations of reachable sets at region boundaries where dynamics change abruptly. This paper introduces a novel approach using hybrid zonotopes for data-driven reachability analysis of piecewise affine systems. Our method addresses the boundary transition problem by developing computational algorithms that calculate the family of set models guaranteed to contain the true system trajectories. Additionally, we extend and evaluate three methods for set-based estimation that account for input-output data with measurement noise.</description>

      <title>LLMind 2.0: Distributed IoT Automation with Natural Language M2M Communication and Lightweight LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated great interest in their applications for IoT automation and device management. However, centralized approaches struggle to scale across heterogeneous, large-scale systems. We present LLMind 2.0, a distributed framework that embeds lightweight LLM-empowered device agents and adopts natural language for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. In LLMind 2.0, a central coordinator translates human instructions into natural-language subtask descriptions, which instruct distributed device agents to generate device-specific code locally based on their proprietary APIs. Using natural language as a unified medium overcomes device heterogeneity and enables seamless device collaboration. LLMind 2.0 integrates: 1) a timeout-based deadlock avoidance protocol that coordinates distributed subtask executions, 2) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism for precise subtask-to-API mapping, and 3) fine-tuned lightweight LLMs for reliable, device-specific code generation. Experiments in multi-robot warehouse operations and Wi Fi network deployments show LLMind 2.0 improved scalability, reliability, and responsiveness compared to centralized baselines.</description>

      <title>Robust H-infinity control under stochastic requirements: minimizing conditional value-at-risk instead of worst-case performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional robust $\mathcal H_2/\mathcal H_\infty$ control minimizes the worst-case performance, often leading to a conservative design driven by very rare parametric configurations. To reduce this conservatism while taking advantage of the stochastic properties of Monte-Carlo sampling and its compatibility with parallel computing, we introduce an alternative paradigm that optimizes the controller with respect to a stochastic criterion, namely the conditional value at risk. We illustrate the potential of this approach on a realistic satellite benchmark, showing that it can significantly improve overall performance by tolerating some degradation in very rare worst-case scenarios.</description>

      <title>A model predictive control framework with robust stability guarantees under unbounded disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address feasibility issues in model predictive control (MPC), most implementations relax state constraints by using slack variables and adding a penalty to the cost. We propose an alternative strategy: relaxing the initial state constraint with a penalty. Compared to state-of-the-art soft constrained MPC formulations, the proposed formulation has two key features: (i) input-to-state stability and bounds on the cumulative constraint violation for unbounded disturbances; (ii) close-to-optimal performance under nominal operating conditions. The idea is initially presented for open-loop asymptotically stable nonlinear systems by designing the penalty as a Lyapunov function, but we also show how to relax this condition to: i) Lyapunov stable systems; ii) stabilizable systems; and iii) utilizing an implicit characterization of the Lyapunov function. In the special case of linear systems, the proposed MPC formulation reduces to a quadratic program, and the offline design and online computational complexity are only marginally increased compared to a nominal design. Numerical examples demonstrate benefits compared to state-of-the-art soft-constrained MPC formulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the need for robust positioning, navigation, and timing services in lunar environments, this paper proposes a novel onboard clock phase jump detection framework for satellite constellations using range measurements obtained from dual one-way inter-satellite links. Our approach leverages vertex redundantly rigid graphs to detect faults without relying on prior knowledge of satellite positions or clock biases, providing flexibility for lunar satellite networks with diverse satellite types and operators. We model satellite constellations as graphs, where satellites are vertices and inter-satellite links are edges. The proposed algorithm detects and identifies satellites with clock jumps by monitoring the singular values of the geometric-centered Euclidean distance matrix (GCEDM) of 5-clique sub-graphs. The proposed method is validated through simulations of a GPS constellation and a notional constellation around the Moon, demonstrating its effectiveness in various configurations.</description>

      <title>Prescribed Performance Control of Unknown Euler-Lagrange Systems Under Input Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a prescribed performance control framework for trajectory tracking in Euler-Lagrange systems with unknown dynamics and prescribed input constraints. The proposed approach enforces hard funnel constraints, meaning that the prescribed performance bounds must not be violated during operation. We derive feasibility conditions that guarantee the tracking error evolves within these predefined funnels while ensuring bounded control inputs. To handle situations where the feasibility conditions are not satisfied, we introduce two approximation-free control strategies: one that actively drives the error back toward the funnel and another that prioritizes safety by preventing further deviation. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulation studies and hardware experiments, highlighting its suitability for real-world robotic systems operating under strict input limits.</description>

      <title>MARLIN: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Murmuration Intelligence and LLM Guidance for Reservoir Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security. Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%, cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.</description>

      <title>Improving Variational Autoencoder using Random Fourier Transformation: An Aviation Safety Anomaly Detection Case-Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the training process and inference improvements of deep neural networks (DNNs), specifically Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), using Random Fourier Transformation (RFT). We further explore the role of RFT in model training behavior using Frequency Principle (F-Principle) analysis and show that models with RFT turn to learn low frequency and high frequency at the same time, whereas conventional DNNs start from low frequency and gradually learn (if successful) high-frequency features. We focus on reconstruction-based anomaly detection using autoencoder and variational autoencoder and investigate the RFT's role. We also introduced a trainable variant of RFT that uses the existing computation graph to train the expansion of RFT instead of it being random. We showcase our findings with two low-dimensional synthetic datasets for data representation, and an aviation safety dataset, called Dashlink, for high-dimensional reconstruction-based anomaly detection. The results indicate the superiority of models with Fourier transformation compared to the conventional counterpart and remain inconclusive regarding the benefits of using trainable Fourier transformation in contrast to the Random variant.</description>

      <title>CONSENT: A Negotiation Framework for Leveraging User Flexibility in Vehicle-to-Building Charging under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.</description>

      <title>Online Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Controllers for Autonomous Driving via Real-Time Recurrent RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.</description>
