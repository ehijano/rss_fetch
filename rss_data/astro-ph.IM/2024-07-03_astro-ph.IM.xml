      <title>Accurate measurement of telescope filter bandpasses with a Collimated Beam Projector and impact on cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of magnitudes with different filters in photometric surveys gives access to cosmological distances and parameters. However, for current and future large surveys like the ZTF, DES, HSC or LSST, the photometric calibration uncertainties are almost comparable to statistical uncertainties in the error budget of type Ia cosmology analysis, which limits our ability to use type Ia supernovae for precision cosmology. The knowledge of the bandpasses of the survey filters at the per-mill level can help reach the sub-percent precision for magnitudes. We show how a misknowledge of the bandpasses central wavelengths or of the presence of out-of-band leakages leads to biased cosmological measurements. Then, we present how to measure the filter throughputs at the required precision with a Collimated Beam Projector.</description>

      <title>RETINA: a hardware-in-the-loop optical facility with reduced optical aberrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing interest in spacecraft autonomy and the complex tasks to be accomplished by the spacecraft raise the need for a trustworthy approach to perform Verification &amp; Validation of Guidance, Navigation, and Control algorithms. In the context of autonomous operations, vision-based navigation algorithms have established themselves as effective solutions to determine the spacecraft state in orbit with low-cost and versatile sensors. Nevertheless, detailed testing must be performed on ground to understand the algorithm's robustness and performance on flight hardware. Given the impossibility of testing directly on orbit these algorithms, a dedicated simulation framework must be developed to emulate the orbital environment in a laboratory setup. This paper presents the design of a low-aberration optical facility called RETINA to perform this task. RETINA is designed to accommodate cameras with different characteristics (e.g., sensor size and focal length) while ensuring the correct stimulation of the camera detector. A preliminary design is performed to identify the range of possible components to be used in the facility according to the facility requirements. Then, a detailed optical design is performed in Zemax OpticStudio to optimize the number and characteristics of the lenses composing the facility's optical systems. The final design is compared against the preliminary design to show the superiority of the optical performance achieved with this approach. This work presents also a calibration procedure to estimate the misalignment and the centering errors in the facility. These estimated parameters are used in a dedicated compensation algorithm, enabling the stimulation of the camera at tens of arcseconds of precision. Finally, two different applications are presented to show the versatility of RETINA in accommodating different cameras and in simulating different mission scenarios.</description>

      <title>A neural networks method to search for long transient gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for long transient gravitational waves signals, like those expected from fast spinning newborn magnetars, in interferometric detector data. Standard search techniques are computationally unfeasible (matched filtering) or very demanding (sub-optimal semi-coherent methods). We explored a different approach by means of machine learning paradigms, to define a fast and inexpensive procedure. We used convolutional neural networks to develop a classifier that is able to discriminate between the presence or the absence of a signal. To complement the classification and enhance its effectiveness, we also developed a denoiser. We studied the performance of both networks with simulated colored noise, according to the design noise curve of LIGO interferometers. We show that the combination of the two models is crucial to increase the chance of detection. Indeed, as we decreased the signal initial amplitude (from $10^{-22}$ down to $10^{-23}$) the classification task became more difficult. In particular, we could not correctly tag signals with an initial amplitude of $2 \times 10^{-23}$ without using the denoiser. By studying the performance of the combined networks, we found a good compromise between the search false alarm rate (2$\%$) and efficiency (90$\%$) for a single interferometer. In addition, we demonstrated that our method is robust with respect to changes in the power law describing the time evolution of the signal frequency. Our results highlight the computationally low cost of this method to generate triggers for long transient signals. The study carried out in this work lays the foundations for further improvements, with the purpose of developing a pipeline able to perform systematic searches of long transient signals.</description>

      <title>Cosmic accretion shocks as a tool to measure the dark matter mass of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological accretion shocks created during the formation of galaxy clusters are a ubiquitous phenomenon all around the Universe. These shocks, and their features, are intimately related with the gravitational energy put into play during galaxy cluster formation. Studying a sample of simulated galaxy clusters and their associated accretion shocks, we show that objects in our sample sit in a plane within the three dimensional-space of cluster total mass, shock radius, and Mach number (a measure of shock intensity). Using this relation, and considering that forthcoming new observations will be able to measure shock radii and intensities, we put forward the idea that the dark matter content of galaxy clusters could be indirectly measured with an error up to around 30 per cent at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This procedure would be a new and independent method to measure the dark matter mass in cosmic structures, and a novel constraint to the accepted $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Distributed Instruments for Planetary Surface Science: Scientific Opportunities and Technology Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we assess the scientific promise and technology feasibility of distributed instruments for planetary science. A distributed instrument is an instrument designed to collect spatially and temporally correlated data from multiple networked, geographically distributed point sensors. Distributed instruments are ubiquitous in Earth science, where they are routinely employed for weather and climate science, seismic studies and resource prospecting, and detection of industrial emissions. However, to date, their adoption in planetary surface science has been minimal. It is natural to ask whether this lack of adoption is driven by low potential to address high-priority questions in planetary science; immature technology; or both. To address this question, we survey high-priority planetary science questions that are uniquely well-suited to distributed instruments. We identify four areas of research where distributed instruments hold promise to unlock answers that are largely inaccessible to monolithic sensors, namely, weather and climate studies of Mars; localization of seismic events on rocky and icy bodies; localization of trace gas emissions, primarily on Mars; and magnetometry studies of internal composition. Next, we survey enabling technologies for distributed sensors and assess their maturity. We identify sensor placement (including descent and landing on planetary surfaces), power, and instrument autonomy as three key areas requiring further investment to enable future distributed instruments. Overall, this work shows that distributed instruments hold great promise for planetary science, and paves the way for follow-on studies of future distributed instruments for Solar System in-situ science.</description>

      <title>Geophysical Observations of the 24 September 2023 OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule Re-Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sample Return Capsules (SRCs) entering Earth's atmosphere at hypervelocity from interplanetary space are a valuable resource for studying meteor phenomena. The 24 September 2023 arrival of the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) SRC provided an unprecedented chance for geophysical observations of a well-characterized source with known parameters, including timing and trajectory. A collaborative effort involving researchers from 16 institutions executed a carefully planned geophysical observational campaign at strategically chosen locations, deploying over 400 ground-based sensors encompassing infrasound, seismic, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), and GPS technologies. Additionally, balloons equipped with infrasound sensors were launched to capture signals at higher altitudes. This campaign (the largest of its kind so far) yielded a wealth of invaluable data anticipated to fuel scientific inquiry for years to come. The success of the observational campaign is evidenced by the near-universal detection of signals across instruments, both proximal and distal. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the collective scientific effort, field deployment, and preliminary findings. The early findings have the potential to inform future space missions and terrestrial campaigns, contributing to our understanding of meteoroid interactions with planetary atmospheres. Furthermore, the dataset collected during this campaign will improve entry and propagation models as well as augment the study of atmospheric dynamics and shock phenomena generated by meteoroids and similar sources.</description>

      <title>LtU-ILI: An All-in-One Framework for Implicit Inference in Astrophysics and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference (LtU-ILI) pipeline, a codebase for rapid, user-friendly, and cutting-edge machine learning (ML) inference in astrophysics and cosmology. The pipeline includes software for implementing various neural architectures, training schemata, priors, and density estimators in a manner easily adaptable to any research workflow. It includes comprehensive validation metrics to assess posterior estimate coverage, enhancing the reliability of inferred results. Additionally, the pipeline is easily parallelizable and is designed for efficient exploration of modeling hyperparameters. To demonstrate its capabilities, we present real applications across a range of astrophysics and cosmology problems, such as: estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray photometry; inferring cosmology from matter power spectra and halo point clouds; characterizing progenitors in gravitational wave signals; capturing physical dust parameters from galaxy colors and luminosities; and establishing properties of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We also include exhaustive benchmarking and comparisons of all implemented methods as well as discussions about the challenges and pitfalls of ML inference in astronomical sciences. All code and examples are made publicly available at https://github.com/maho3/ltu-ili.</description>

      <title>Low temperature proton irradiation with DEPFETs for Athena's Wide Field Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wide Field Imager (WFI), one of two instruments on ESA's next large X-ray mission Athena, is designed for imaging spectroscopy of X-rays in the range of 0.2 to 15 keV with a large field of view and high count rate capability. The focal plane consists of back-illuminated DEPFET (Depleted p-channel field effect transistor) sensors that have a high radiation tolerance and provide a near Fano-limited energy resolution. To achieve this, a very low noise readout is required, about 3 electrons ENC at beginning of life is foreseen. This makes the device very susceptible to any radiation induced worsening of the readout noise. The main mechanism of degradation will be the increase of dark current due to displacement damage caused primarily by high energy protons. To study the expected performance degradation, a prototype detector module with fully representative pixel layout and fabrication technology was irradiated with 62.4 MeV protons at the accelerator facility MedAustron in Wiener Neustadt. A total dose equivalent to 3.3 $\textstyle{10^{9}}$ 10-MeV protons/$\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ was applied in two steps. During, in-between and after the irradiations the detector remained at the operating temperature of 213 K and was fully biased and operated. Data was recorded to analyze the signal of all incident particles. We report on the increase of dark current after the irradiation and present the current related damage rate at 213 K. The effect of low temperature annealing at 213 K , 236 K, 253 K, 273 K, and 289 K is presented.</description>

      <title>Albatross: A scalable simulation-based inference pipeline for analysing stellar streams in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams are potentially a very sensitive observational probe of galactic astrophysics, as well as the dark matter population in the Milky Way. On the other hand, performing a detailed, high-fidelity statistical analysis of these objects is challenging for a number of key reasons. Firstly, the modelling of streams across their (potentially billions of years old) dynamical age is complex and computationally costly. Secondly, their detection and classification in large surveys such as Gaia renders a robust statistical description regarding e.g., the stellar membership probabilities, challenging. As a result, the majority of current analyses must resort to simplified models that use only subsets or summaries of the high quality data. In this work, we develop a new analysis framework that takes advantage of advances in simulation-based inference techniques to perform complete analysis on complex stream models. To facilitate this, we develop a new, modular dynamical modelling code sstrax for stellar streams that is highly accelerated using jax. We test our analysis pipeline on a mock observation that resembles the GD1 stream, and demonstrate that we can perform robust inference on all relevant parts of the stream model simultaneously. Finally, we present some outlook as to how this approach can be developed further to perform more complete and accurate statistical analyses of current and future data.</description>

      <title>Peregrine: Sequential simulation-based inference for gravitational wave signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current and upcoming generations of gravitational wave experiments represent an exciting step forward in terms of detector sensitivity and performance. For example, key upgrades at the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA facilities will see the next observing run (O4) probe a spatial volume around four times larger than the previous run (O3), and design implementations for e.g. the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and LISA experiments are taking shape to explore a wider frequency range and probe cosmic distances. In this context, however, a number of very real data analysis problems face the gravitational wave community. For example, it will be crucial to develop tools and strategies to analyse (amongst other scenarios) signals that arrive coincidentally in detectors, longer signals that are in the presence of non-stationary noise or other shorter transients, as well as noisy, potentially correlated, coherent stochastic backgrounds. With these challenges in mind, we develop peregrine, a new sequential simulation-based inference approach designed to study broad classes of gravitational wave signal. In this work, we describe the method and implementation, before demonstrating its accuracy and robustness through direct comparison with established likelihood-based methods. Specifically, we show that we are able to fully reconstruct the posterior distributions for every parameter of a spinning, precessing compact binary coalescence using one of the most physically detailed and computationally expensive waveform approximants (SEOBNRv4PHM). Crucially, we are able to do this using only 2% of the waveform evaluations that are required in e.g. nested sampling approaches. Finally, we provide some outlook as to how this level of simulation efficiency and flexibility in the statistical analysis could allow peregrine to tackle these current and future gravitational wave data analysis problems.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference for stochastic gravitational wave background data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of space- and ground-based facilities promise to reveal an entirely new picture of the gravitational wave sky: thousands of galactic and extragalactic binary signals, as well as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) of unresolved astrophysical and possibly cosmological signals. These will need to be disentangled to achieve the scientific goals of experiments such as LISA, Einstein Telescope, or Cosmic Explorer. We focus on one particular aspect of this challenge: reconstructing an SGWB from (mock) LISA data. We demonstrate that simulation-based inference (SBI) - specifically truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE) - is a promising avenue to overcome some of the technical difficulties and compromises necessary when applying more traditional methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). To highlight this, we show that we can reproduce results from traditional methods both for a template-based and agnostic search for an SGWB. Moreover, as a demonstration of the rich potential of SBI, we consider the injection of a population of low signal-to-noise ratio supermassive black hole transient signals into the data. TMNRE can implicitly marginalize over this complicated parameter space, enabling us to directly and accurately reconstruct the stochastic (and instrumental noise) contributions. We publicly release our TMNRE implementation in the form of the code saqqara.</description>

      <title>Neutron and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-ray Discrimination by a Pressurized Helium-4 Based Scintillation Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pressurized helium-4 based fast neutron scintillation detector offers an useful alternative to organic liquid-based scintillator due to its relatively low response to the $\gamma$-rays compared to the latter type of scintillator. In the present work, we have investigated the capabilities of a pressurized $^4$He (PHe) detector for the detection of fast neutrons in a mixed radiation field where both the neutrons and the $\gamma$-rays are present. Discrimination between neutrons and $\gamma$-rays is achieved by using fast-slow charge integration method. We have also conducted systematic studies of the attenuation of fast neutrons and $\gamma$-rays by high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These studies are further corroborated by simulation analyses conducted using GEANT4, which show qualitative agreement with the experimental results. Additionally, the simulation provides detailed insights into the interactions of the radiation quanta with the PHe detector. Estimates of the scintillation signal yield are made based on our GEANT4 simulation results by considering the scintillation mechanism in the PHe gas.</description>
