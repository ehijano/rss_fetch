      <title>[Mg/Fe] and variable initial mass function: Revision of [$\alpha$/Fe] for massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of nearby massive galaxies have revealed that they are older and richer in metals and magnesium than their low-mass counterparts. In particular, the overabundance of magnesium compared to iron, [Mg/Fe], is interpreted to reflect the short star formation history that the current massive galaxies underwent early in the Universe. We present a systematic revision of the [Mg/Fe] - velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) relation based on stacked spectra of early-type galaxies with a high signal-to-noise ratio from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Using the penalized pixel-fitting (pPXF) method of Cappellari &amp; Emsellem 2004 and the Vazdekis et al. 2015 MILES single stellar population (SSP) models, we fit a wide optical wavelength range to measure the net $\alpha$-abundance. The combination of pPXF and $\alpha$-enhanced MILES models incorrectly leads to an apparently decreasing trend of [$\alpha$/Fe] with velocity dispersion. We interpret this result as a consequence of variations in the individual abundances of the different $\alpha$-elements. This warrants caution for a na\"ive use of full spectral fitting algorithms paired with stellar population models that do not take individual elemental abundance variations into account, especially when deriving averaged quantities such as the mean [$\alpha$/Fe] of a stellar population. In addition, and based on line-strength measurements, we quantify the impact of a non-universal initial mass function on the recovered abundance pattern of galaxies. In particular, we find that a simultaneous fit of the slope of the initial mass function and the [Mg/Fe] results in a shallower [Mg/Fe]-$\sigma$ relation. Therefore, our results suggest that star formation in massive galaxies lasted longer than what has been reported previously, although it still occurred significantly faster than in the solar neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>lenscat: a Public and Community-Contributed Catalog of Known Strong Gravitational Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lenscat, a public and community-contributed catalog of strong gravitational lenses found by electromagnetic surveys. The main objective of lenscat is to compile a simple, easy-to-access catalog that can be used in a variety of lensing studies, such as facilitating the search for the host galaxy of a candidate strongly lensed transient event. We also provide a python package to interact with tools commonly used by the community. This allows end users both with and without lensing expertise to obtain a list of known strong lenses within a given search area, and to also rank them by their respective searched probabilities. Here, we exemplify this by crossmatching the gravitational wave joint sky localization region of an interesting pair of events GW170104-GW170814. Other examples with short gamma-ray bursts are given. Thanks to the open and simple infrastructure of lenscat, members of the lensing community can directly add newly found lenses from their own studies to help create a long-lasting catalog that is as exhaustive and accessible as possible.</description>

      <title>The MUSE eXtremely Deep Field: Detections of circumgalactic SiII* emission at z&gt;~2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) serves as a baryon reservoir that connects galaxies to the intergalactic medium and fuels star formation. The spatial distribution of the metal-enriched cool CGM has not yet been directly revealed at cosmic noon (z~2-4), as bright emission lines at these redshifts are not covered by optical integral field units. To remedy this situation, we aim for the first-ever detections and exploration of extended SiII* emission (low-ionization state, LIS), referred to as ``SiII* halos'', at redshifts ranging from z=2 to 4 as a means to trace the metal-enriched cool CGM. We use a sample of 39 galaxies with systemic redshifts of z=2.1-3.9 measured with the [CIII] doublet in the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field catalog, which contains integration times spanning from ~30 to 140 hours. We search for extended SiII*1265, 1309, 1533 emission (fluorescent lines) around individual galaxies. We also stack a subsample of 14 UV-bright galaxies. We report five individual detections of SiII*1533 halos. We also confirm the presence of SiII*1533 halos in stacks for the subsample containing UV-bright sources. The other lines do not show secure detections of extended emission in either individual or stacking analyses. These detections may imply that the presence of metal-enriched CGM is a common characteristic for UV-bright galaxies. To investigate whether the origin of SiII* is continuum pumping as suggested in previous studies, we check the consistency of the equivalent width (EW) of SiII* emission and the EW of SiII absorption for the individual halo object with the most reliable detection. We confirm the equivalence, suggesting that photon conservation works for this object and pointing toward continuum pumping as the source of SiII*. We also investigate SiII* lines in a RAMSES-RT zoom-in simulation including continuum pumping and find ubiquitous presence of extended halos.</description>

      <title>Identifying Host Galaxies of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Found by PTAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) present us with exciting opportunities for multi-messenger science. These systems are thought to form naturally in galaxy mergers and therefore have the potential to produce electromagnetic (EM) radiation as well as gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Once GWs from individually resolved SMBHBs are detected, the identification of the host galaxy will be a major challenge due to the ambiguity in possible EM signatures and the poor localization capability of PTAs. In order to aid EM observations in choosing which sources to follow up, we attempt to quantify the number of plausible hosts in both realistic and idealistic scenarios. We outline a host galaxy identification pipeline that injects a single-source GW signal into a simulated PTA dataset, uses production-level techniques to recover the signal, quantifies the localization region and number of galaxies contained therein, and finally imposes cuts on the galaxies using the binary parameters estimated from the GW search. In an ideal case, we find that the 90% credible areas span 29 deg^2 to 241 deg^2, containing about 14 to 341 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies remaining ranges from 22 at worst to 1 (the true host) at best. In a more realistic case, if the signal is sufficiently localized, the sky areas range from 287 deg^2 to 530 deg^2 and enclose about 285 to 1238 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies is 397 at worst and 27 at best. While the signal-to-noise ratio is the primary determinant of the localization area of a given source, we find that the size of the area is also influenced by the proximity of nearby pulsars on the sky and the chirp mass of the source.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of High Velocity Clouds in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of our Galaxy's high-velocity clouds (HVCs) remains a mystery after many decades of effort. In this paper, we use the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to identify cool, dense clouds that match observations of Galactic HVCs. We track these clouds back in time to determine their origin. We find that only 17% of HVCs (by mass) can be tracked directly to the disk, and 21% to satellite accretion. The majority of HVCs (62%) arise from warm and hot circumgalactic gas that cools through thermal instability. They then obtain their anomalous velocities through interactions with the turbulent circumgalactic medium. At TNG50 resolution, we do not see evidence for HVCs forming out of very low metallicity intergalactic material. Instead, low metallicity HVCs are most likely associated with satellite accretion. These results suggest that Galactic HVCs are highly heterogeneous in their origin, and can provide insight into the physical processes that shape the circumgalactic medium such as disk outflows, satellite accretion, and thermal instabilities.</description>

      <title>Halfway to the Peak: The JWST MIRI 5.6 micron number counts and source population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of 8 JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument 5.6 micron images with 5sigma depths of ~0.1uJy. We detect 2854 sources within our combined area of 18.4 sq.arcmin -- a &gt;4x increase in source density over earlier IRAC channel 3 data. We compute the MIRI 5.6um number counts including an analysis of the field-to-field variation. Relative to earlier published MIRI 5.6micron counts, our counts have a more pronounced knee, at roughly 2\,$\mu$Jy. The location and amplitude of the counts at the knee are consistent with the Cowley et al. (2018) model predictions, although these models tend to overpredict the counts below the knee. In areas of overlap, 84% of the MIRI sources have a counterpart in the COSMOS2020 catalog. These MIRI sources have redshifts that are mostly in the z~0.5-2, with a tail out to z~5. They are predominantly moderate to low stellar masses $10^8-10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$) main sequence star-forming galaxies suggesting that with $\approx$2hr exposures, MIRI can reach well below $M^*$ at cosmic noon and reach higher mass systems out to z~5. Nearly 70% of the COSMOS2020 sources in areas of overlap now have a data point at 5.6micron (rest-frame near-IR at cosmic noon) which allows for more accurate stellar population parameter estimates. Finally, we discover 31 MIRI-bright sources not in COSMOS2020. A cross-match with IRAC channel 1 suggests that 10-20% of these are likely lower mass (M$_*\approx10^9$M$_{\odot}$), $z\sim1$ dusty galaxies. The rest (80--90%) are consistent with more massive, but still very dusty galaxies at z&gt;3.</description>

      <title>Identification and Quenching of Nugget Galaxies in the RESOLVE Survey at z = 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete census of candidate nuggets, i.e., dense galaxies likely formed by compaction with intense gas influx, within the volume-limited $z \sim 0$ REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) survey. These nuggets span all evolutionary stages and 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass ($M_{*} \sim 10^{8} M_\odot$ to $10^{11} M_\odot$) from the dwarf to the giant regime. We develop selection criteria for our $z\sim0$ nugget candidates based on structure and introduce the use of environmental criteria to eliminate nugget-like objects with suspected non-compaction origins. The resulting $z\sim0$ nuggets follow expectations with respect to structure (i.e., density, size), population frequency, and likely origins. We show that the properties of our nugget census are consistent with permanent quenching above the gas-richness threshold scale (halo mass $M_{halo} \sim 10^{11.4} M_\odot$), cyclic temporary quenching below the threshold scale, and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) assisting in permanent quenching. As predicted in simulations, most nuggets quench within the halo mass range $M_{halo} \sim 10^{11.45} M_\odot$ to $10^{11.9} M_\odot$. We find $\sim 0.29$ dex scatter around the star-forming main sequence for candidate blue nuggets below the threshold scale, which is consistent with temporary quenching as seen in simulations. A transitional population of green nuggets appears above the threshold scale. AGN also become more common in nuggets above this scale, and we see a likely AGN excess in nuggets vs. comparably selected non-nuggets. Our results provide the first observational confirmation of the mass-dependent, AGN-mediated shift from cyclic quenching to halo quenching in nuggets.</description>

      <title>JWST view of three infant galaxies at z=8.3 and implications for reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy provides redshifts for two z &gt; 8 galaxies located behind the lensing cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. Both galaxies are strong [O iii]{\lambda}5007 emitters. For one galaxy, "Y1", the existing redshift z = 8.31, based on ALMA measurements of [O iii] 88 {\mu}m and [C ii] 157.7 {\mu}m lines, is confirmed. JWST/NIRCam images resolve this galaxy into three components of similar colors, and the whole system extends over ~3.4 kpc. The other galaxy, "JD", is at z = 8.34 instead of the previously claimed z = 9.28. It has a companion, "JD-N", at the same redshift with projected separation ~2.3 kpc. All objects are only moderately magnified and have intrinsic MUV ranging from -19.66 to -20.85 mag. Their eight-band NIRCam spectral energy distributions show that the galaxies are all very young with ages $\lesssim$11 Myr and stellar masses about 108 $M_{\odot}$. These infant galaxies are actively forming stars at rates of a few tens to a couple of hundred $M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$, but only one of them (JD) has a blue rest-frame UV slope. This slope indicates a high Lyman-continuum photon escape fraction that could contribute significantly to the cosmic hydrogen-reionizing background. The other two systems have much flatter slopes largely because their dust extinction is twice as high as JD's albeit only AV ~ 0.90 mag. The much lower indicated escape fractions show that even very young, actively star-forming galaxies can have negligible contribution to reionization when they quickly form dust throughout their bodies.</description>

      <title>\texttt{Simba}-\texttt{C}: the evolution of the thermal and chemical properties in the intragroup medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly updated \texttt{GIZMO} and \texttt{Simba} based simulation, \texttt{Simba-C}, with its new stellar feedback, chemical enrichment, and recalibrated AGN feedback, allows for a detailed study of the intragroup medium X-ray properties. We discuss the impact of various physical mechanisms, e.g. stellar and AGN feedback, and chemical enrichment, on the composition and the global scaling relations of nearby galaxy groups. We also study the evolution ($z=2$ to $0$) of the global properties for the $1\,\mathrm{keV}$ temperature groups. \texttt{Simba-C} shows improved consistent matching with the observations of all X-ray scaling relations compared to \texttt{Simba}. It is well known that AGN feedback has a significant influence on $L_{X,0.5-2.0}-T_{spec,corr}$, $S_{500/2500}-T_{spec,corr}$, and gas mass fractions, with our \texttt{Simba-C} results consistent with it. Our recalibrated AGN feedback strength also showed an additional improvement in gas entropy, which now aligns with CLoGS observations. The updated stellar feedback and chemical enrichment model is shown to play an important role in our understanding of the chemical abundance ratios and their evolution within galaxy groups. In particular, we find that \texttt{Simba-C} produces an increase in the amount of heavier elements (specifically Si and Fe) relative to O, compared to \texttt{Simba}.</description>

      <title>The RGB tip in the SDSS, PS1, JWST, NGRST and Euclid photometric systems. Calibration in optical passbands using Gaia DR3 synthetic photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use synthetic photometry from Gaia DR3 BP and RP spectra for a large selected sample of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to derive the magnitude of the Red Giant Branch (RGB) tip for these two galaxies in several passbands in various widely used optical photometric systems, including those of space missions that have not yet started operations. The RGB tip is estimated by fitting a well-motivated model to the RGB luminosity function (LF) within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing for a proper representation of the uncertainties of all the involved parameters and their correlations. Adopting the best available distance and interstellar extinction estimates we provide a calibration of the RGB tip as a standard candle for the following passbands: Johnson-Kron-Cousins I (mainly used for validation purposes), Hubble Space Telescope F814W, Sloan Digital Sky Survey i and z, PanSTARRS1 y, James Webb Space Telescope F090W, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Z087, and Euclid I$_E$, with an accuracy of a few per cent, depending on the case. The trend of the absolute magnitude of the tip as a function of colour in the different passbands, beyond the range spanned by the LMC and SMC, as well as its dependency on age, is explored by means of theoretical models. These calibrations can be very helpful to obtain state-of-the-art RGB tip distance estimates to stellar systems in a very large range of distances directly from data in the natural photometric system of these surveys and/or missions, without recurring to photometric transformations.

      <title>Star Formation by Supernova Implosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent hydrodynamical simulations of the late stages of supernova remnant (SNR) evolution have revealed that as they merge with the ambient medium, SNRs implode, leading to the formation of dense clouds in their center. While being highly chemically enriched by their host SNR, these clouds appear to have similar properties as giant molecular clouds, which are believed to be the main site of star formation. Here, we develop a simple model, in order to estimate the efficiency of the star formation that might be triggered by the implosion of SNRs. We separately consider two cases, cyclic star formation, maintained by the episodic driving of feedback from new generations of stars; and a single burst of star formation, triggered by a single explosion. We find that in the cyclic case, star formation is inefficient, with implosion-triggered star-formation contributing a few percent of the observed star-formation efficiency per free-fall timescale. In the single-burst case, higher star-formation efficiencies can be obtained. However, while the implosion-triggered process might not contribute much to the overall star-formation, due to the high chemical enrichment of the birth clouds, it can explain the formation of a significant fraction of metal-rich stars.</description>

      <title>The formation and survival of cold gas in a magnetized cool-core galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filaments of cold gas ($T\leq 10^{4}$ K) are found in the inner regions of many cool-core clusters. These structures are thought to play a major role in the regulation of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We study the morphology of the filaments, their formation, and their impact on the propagation of the outflowing AGN jets. We present a set of GPU-accelerated 3D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster using the performance portable code AthenaPK. We include radiative cooling, and a self-regulated AGN feedback model that redistributes accreted material through kinetic, thermal and magnetic feedback. We confirm that magnetic fields play an important role in both the formation and evolution of the cold material. These suppress the formation of massive cold disks and favor magnetically supported filaments over clumpy structures. Achieving resolutions of $25-50$ pc, we find that filaments are not monolithic as they contain numerous and complex magnetically--supported substructures. We find that the mass distribution of these clumps follows a power law for all investigated filaments, consistent with previous cloud-crushing simulations of individual clumps. Studying the evolution of individual filaments, we find that their formation pathways can be diverse. We find examples of filaments forming through a combination of cold gas uplifting and condensation, as well as systems of purely infalling clumps condensing out of the intracluster medium. The density contrast between the cold gas and the outflowing hot material leads to recurring deflections of the jets, favoring inflation of bubbles.</description>

      <title>Discovery of An Apparent Red, High-Velocity Type Ia Supernova at z = 2.9 with JWST</title>

Abstract: We present the JWST discovery of SN 2023adsy, a transient object located in a host galaxy JADES-GS$+53.13485$$-$$27.82088$ with a host spectroscopic redshift of $2.903\pm0.007$. The transient was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Photometric and spectroscopic followup with NIRCam and NIRSpec, respectively, confirm the redshift and yield UV-NIR light-curve, NIR color, and spectroscopic information all consistent with a Type Ia classification. Despite its classification as a likely SN Ia, SN 2023adsy is both fairly red (E(B-V)$\sim0.9$) despite a host galaxy with low-extinction and has a high Ca II velocity ($19,000\pm2,000$km/s) compared to the general population of SNe Ia. While these characteristics are consistent with some Ca-rich SNe Ia, particularly SN 2016hnk, SN 2023adsy is intrinsically brighter than the low-z Ca-rich population. Although such an object is too red for any low-z cosmological sample, we apply a fiducial standardization approach to SN 2023adsy and find that the SN 2023adsy luminosity distance measurement is in excellent agreement ($\lesssim1\sigma$) with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore unlike low-z Ca-rich SNe Ia, SN 2023adsy is standardizable and gives no indication that SN Ia standardized luminosities change significantly with redshift. A larger sample of distant SNe Ia is required to determine if SN Ia population characteristics at high-z truly diverge from their low-z counterparts, and to confirm that standardized luminosities nevertheless remain constant with redshift.</description>

      <title>Searching for stellar population in the molecular cloud GRSMC 045.49+00.04</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the characteristics of young stellar populations is essential for deriving insights into star formation processes within parent molecular clouds and the influence of massive stars. This study focuses on YSOs in the G 045.49+00.04 molecular cloud, including three UC HII regions. Using infrared photometric data and radiation models, we identified 1482 YSOs with masses ranging from 1.5 to 22 Msol. Among these, 315 form dense clusters near IRAS sources, with high-mass stars responsible for ionization. The non-cluster YSOs (1168) are uniformly distributed on the field. The distribution of YSOs from both samples on the colour-magnitude diagram and by the evolutionary ages is different. About 75% of objects in the IRAS clusters are concentrated around the ZAMS and have a well-defined peak at an age of Log(Age[years]) = 6.75, with a narrow spread. The non-cluster objects have two concentrations located to the right and left of the 0.1 Myr isochrone and two well-defined peaks at Log(Age) = 6.25 and 5.25. The K luminosity functions alpha slopes for the IRAS clusters and non-cluster objects are 0.32 and 0.72, respectively. The steeper alpha slope is suggesting that the non-cluster objects are less evolved, which is well consistent with the evolutionary age. Similar patterns were observed in the neighboring G 45.14+00.14 region. The both regions (G 045.49+00.04 and G 45.14+00.14) are located and distinguished by their brightness and density at the edge of the bubble around the highly variable X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, which includes a black hole and a K-giant companion. Based on the above, we can assume that the process of star formation in the young IRAS clusters was triggered by the GRS 915+105-initiated shock front inside the ISM massive condensation, through the process of "collecting and collapse". Most non-cluster objects probably belong to a later generation.</description>

      <title>UVIT Study of the MAgellanic Clouds (U-SMAC) I. Recent star formation history and kinematics of the Shell region in the North-Eastern Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between the Magellanic Clouds significantly affect the shape and distribution of the young stellar population, particularly in the periphery of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We present the first far-UV (FUV) map of the north-east SMC-Shell region using the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. The detected FUV stars are combined with Gaia Early Data Release 3 data to create a FUV-optical catalog of ~ 14,400 stars. FUV-optical colour-magnitude diagrams are used along with isochrones to estimate the stellar ages. The detected stars are formed in multiple episodes. We identified two episodes of star formation (~ 60 and ~ 260 Myr ago) where the episode at ~ 260 Myr is linked to the recent interaction with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the episode at ~ 60 Myr is linked to the pericentric passage of the SMC around our Galaxy. The median proper motion (PM) and velocity dispersion are found to be similar to the SMC main body, indicating that this region has not experienced significant tidal effects. The FUV stellar surface density and the dispersion in PM suggest an extent of the inner SMC in the north-east direction to be around 2.2 deg. We detect arm-like and arc-like structures in the FUV stellar density map, and their kinematics appear to be similar to the SMC main body. These extended outer features are the spatial stellar overdensities formed over multiple episodes of star formation, but without apparent kinematic distinction.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: X-ray beacons at late cosmic dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS) is expected to contain ~100 quasars that emitted their light when the universe was less than a billion years old, i.e. at z&gt;5.6. By selection, these quasars populate the bright end of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and their count offers a powerful demographic diagnostic of the parent super-massive black hole population. Of the &gt;~ 400 quasars that have been discovered at z&gt;5.6 to date, less than 15 % have been X-ray detected. We present a pilot survey to uncover the elusive X-ray luminous end of the distant quasar population. We have designed a quasar selection pipeline based on optical, infrared and X-ray imaging data from DES DR2, VHS DR5, CatWISE2020 and the eRASS. The core selection method relies on SED template fitting. We performed optical follow-up spectroscopy with the Magellan/LDSS3 instrument for the redshift confirmation of a subset of candidates. We have further obtained a deeper X-ray image of one of our candidates with Chandra ACIS-S. We report the discovery of five new quasars in the redshift range 5.6 &lt; z &lt; 6.1. Two of these quasars are detected in eRASS and are by selection X-ray ultra-luminous. These quasars are also detected at radio frequencies. The first one is a broad absorption line quasar which shows significant X-ray dimming over 3.5 years, i.e. about 6 months in the quasar rest frame. The second radio-detected quasar is a jetted source with compact morphology. We show that a blazar configuration is likely for this source, making it the second most distant blazar known to date. With our pilot study, we demonstrate the power of eROSITA as a discovery machine for luminous quasars in the epoch of reionization. The X-ray emission of the two eROSITA detected quasars are likely to be driven by different high-energetic emission mechanisms a diversity which will be further explored in a future systematic full-hemisphere survey.</description>

      <title>The theory of resonant cosmic ray-driven instabilities -- Growth and saturation of single modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) feedback is critical for galaxy formation as CRs drive galactic winds, regularize star formation in galaxies, and escape from active galactic nuclei to heat the cooling cores of galaxy clusters. The feedback strength of CRs depends on their coupling to the background plasma and, as such, on the effective CR transport speed. Traditionally, this has been hypothesized to depend on the balance between wave growth of CR-driven instabilities and their damping. Here, we study the physics of CR-driven instabilities from first principles, starting from a gyrotropic distribution of CR ions that stream along a background magnetic field. We develop a theory of the underlying processes that organize the particles' orbits and in particular their gyrophases, which provides an intuitive physical picture of (i) wave growth as the CR gyrophases start to bunch up lopsidedly towards the local wave magnetic field, (ii) instability saturation as a result of CRs overtaking the wave and damping its amplitude without isotropizing CRs in the wave frame, and (iii) CR back-reaction onto the unstable plasma waves as the CR gyrophases follow a pendulum motion around the wave magnetic field. Using our novel fluid-particle-in-cell code fluid-SHARP, we validate our theory on the evolution and excitation of individual unstable modes, such as forward and backward propagating Alfv\'en and whistler waves. We show that these kinetic simulations support our theoretical considerations, thus potentially foreshadowing a fundamental revision of the theory of CR transport in galaxies and galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Large-scale geometry and topology of gas fields: the effects of AGN and stellar feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar and AGN feedback primarily affect the formation and evolution of galaxies and the circumgalactic medium, leaving some imprint on larger scales. Based on the SIMBA hydrodynamical simulation suite, and using the full set of Minkowski functionals (MFs), this study systematically analyses the time evolution of the global geometry and topology of the gas temperature, pressure, density (total, HI and H$_2$), and metallicity fields between redshift $z=5$ and $z=0$. MFs show that small-scale astrophysical processes are persistent and manifest on larger, up to tens of Mpc scales, highlighting the specific morphological signatures of the relevant feedback mechanisms on such scales in the last $\sim12$~Gyr. In qualitative terms, one can establish a ranking that varies according to the field considered: stellar feedback mostly determines the morphology of the pressure and density fields, AGN jets are the first cause for the morphology of the temperature and metallicity fields, while X-ray heating and AGN winds play the second most important role in shaping the geometry and topology of all the gaseous fields but metallicity. Hence the cosmic evolution of the geometry and topology of fields characterising the thermodynamical and chemical properties of the cosmic web provides complementary larger-scale constraints to galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Cold water emission cannot be used to infer depletion of bulk elemental oxygen [O/H] in disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the constraints provided by Herschel Space Observatory data regarding cold water emission from protoplanetary disks. Previous disk models that were used to interpret observed water emission concluded that oxygen (O/H) is depleted by at least 2 orders of magnitude if a standard, interstellar gas/dust mass ratio is assumed in the disk. In this work, we use model results from a recent disk parameter survey and show that most of the \textit{Herschel} constraints obtained for cold water (i.e. for transitions with an upper energy level $E_\mathrm{up}&lt;200$ K, where the bulk of the disk water lies) can be explained with disk models adopting ISM-like oxygen elemental abundance (i.e. O/H=$3.2\times10^{-4}$) and the canonical gas/dust mass ratio of 100. We show that cold water vapor is mainly formed by photodesorption of water ice at the interface between the molecular layer and the midplane, and that its emission is relatively independent of the main disk properties like the disk gas mass and gas/dust mass ratio. We find that the abundance of water vapor in the outer disk is set by photoprocesses and depends on the (constant) vertical column density of water ice needed to attenuate the FUV photon flux, resulting in roughly constant emission for the parameters (gas mass, dust mass, disk radius) varied in our survey. Importantly, water line emission is found to be optically thick and hence sensitive to temperature more than abundance, possibly driving previous inferences of large scale oxygen depletion.</description>

      <title>M17 MIR: A Massive Star is Forming via Episodic Mass Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyzed the ALMA band 6 data for the outbursting massive protostar M17~MIR. The ALMA CO $J=2-1$ data reveals a collimated and bipolar north-south outflow from M17~MIR. The blue-shifted outflow exhibits four CO knots (N1 to N4) along the outflow axis, while the red-shifted outflow appears as a single knot (S1). The extremely high velocity (EHV) emissions of N1 and S1 are jet-like and contain sub-knots along the outflow axis. Assuming the nearest EHV sub-knots trace the ejecta from the accretion outbursts in the past decades, a tangential ejection velocity of $\sim421\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ is derived for M17~MIR. Assuming the same velocity, the dynamical times of the multiple ejecta, traced by the four blue-shifted CO knots, range from 20 to 364 years. The four blue-shifted CO knots imply four clustered accretion outbursts with a duration of tens of years in the past few hundred years. The intervals between the four clustered accretion outbursts are also about tens of years. These properties of the four clustered accretion outbursts are in line with the disk gravitational instability and fragmentation model. The episodic accretion history of M17~MIR traced by episodic outflow suggests that a massive star can form from a lower-mass protostar via frequent episodic accretion events triggered by disk gravitational instability and fragmentation. The first detection of the knotty outflow from an outbursting massive protostar suggests that mass ejections accompanied with accretion events could serve as an effective diagnostic tool for the episodic accretion histories of massive protostars.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity effects on the SMBH GW background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how eccentricity affects the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We develop a fast and accurate semi-analytic method for computing the GW spectra, the distribution for the spectral fluctuations and the correlations between different frequencies. As GW emission circularizes binaries, the suppression of the signal strength due to eccentricity will be relevant for signals from wider binaries emitting at lower frequencies. Such a feature is present in the signal observed at pulsar timing arrays. We find that, when orbital decay of the SMBH binaries is driven by GWs only, the shape of the observed signal prefers highly eccentric binaries $\langle e \rangle_{2\,{\rm nHz}} = 0.83^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$. However, when environmental effects are included, the initial eccentricity can be significantly lowered yet the scenario with purely circular binaries is mildly disfavored.</description>

      <title>A homogeneous measurement of the delay between the onsets of gas stripping and star formation quenching in satellite galaxies of groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine orbital information from N-body simulations with an analytic model for star formation quenching and SDSS observations to infer the differential effect of the group/cluster environment on star formation in satellite galaxies. We also consider a model for gas stripping, using the same input supplemented with HI fluxes from the ALFALFA survey. The models are motivated by and tested on the Hydrangea cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suite. We recover the characteristic times when satellite galaxies are stripped and quenched. Stripping in massive ($M_\mathrm{ vir}\sim 10^{14.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) clusters typically occurs at or just before the first pericentric passage. Lower mass ($\sim10^{13.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) groups strip their satellites on a significantly longer (by $\sim3\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) timescale. Quenching occurs later: Balmer emission lines typically fade $\sim3.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ ($5.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) after first pericentre in clusters (groups), followed a few hundred $\mathrm{Myr}$ later by reddenning in $(g-r)$ colour. These `delay timescales' are remarkably constant across the entire satellite stellar mass range probed ($\sim10^{9.5}-10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$), a feature closely tied to our treatment of `group pre-processing'. The lowest mass groups in our sample ($\sim10^{12.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) strip and quench their satellites extremely inefficiently: typical timescales may approach the age of the Universe. Our measurements are qualitatively consistent with the `delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario advocated for by several other studies, but we find significantly longer delay times. Our combination of a homogeneous analysis and input catalogues yields new insight into the sequence of events leading to quenching across wide intervals in host and satellite mass.</description>

      <title>Constraining quenching timescales in galaxy clusters by forward-modelling stellar ages and quiescent fractions in projected phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We forward-model mass-weighted stellar ages (MWAs) and quiescent fractions in projected phase space (PPS), using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to jointly constrain an infall quenching model for galaxies in $\log(M_{\mathrm{vir}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})&gt;14$ galaxy clusters at $z\sim 0$. We find the average deviation in MWA from the MWA-$M_\star$ relation depends on position in PPS, with a maximum difference between the inner cluster and infalling interloper galaxies of $\sim 1$ Gyr. Our model employs infall information from N-body simulations and stochastic star-formation histories from the UniverseMachine model. We find total quenching times of $t_\mathrm{Q}=3.7\pm 0.4$ Gyr and $t_\mathrm{Q}=4.0\pm 0.2$ Gyr after first pericentre, for $9&lt;\log(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})&lt;10$ and $10&lt;\log(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})&lt;10.5$ galaxies, respectively. By using MWAs, we break the degeneracy in time of quenching onset and timescale of star formation rate (SFR) decline. We find that time of quenching onset relative to pericentre is $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=3.5^{+0.6}_{-0.9}$ Gyr and $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=-0.3^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ Gyr for our lower and higher stellar mass bins, respectively, and exponential SFR suppression timescales are $\tau_{\mathrm{env}}\leq 1.0$ Gyr and $\tau_{\mathrm{env}}\sim 2.3$ Gyr for our lower and higher stellar mass bins, respectively. Stochastic star formation histories remove the need for rapid infall quenching to maintain the bimodality in the SFR of cluster galaxies; the depth of the green valley prefers quenching onsets close to first pericentre and a longer quenching envelope, in slight tension with the MWA-driven results. Taken together these results suggest that quenching begins close to, or just after pericentre, but the timescale for quenching to be fully complete is much longer and therefore ram-pressure stripping is not complete on first pericentric passage.</description>

      <title>On the origin of star-formation quenching in massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ in the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG, we perform a comprehensive analysis of quiescent, massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$. The goal is to understand what suppresses their star formation so early in cosmic time, and how other similar mass galaxies remain highly star-forming. As a first-order result, the simulations are able to produce massive, quiescent galaxies in this high-redshift regime. We find that active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is the primary cause of halting star formation in early, massive galaxies. Not only do the central, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of the quenched galaxies have earlier seed times, but they also grow faster than in star-forming galaxies. As a result, the quenched galaxies are exposed to AGN feedback for longer, and experience the kinetic, jet-mode of the AGN feedback earlier than the star-forming galaxies. The release of kinetic energy reduces inflows of gas while likely maintaining outflows, which keeps a low cold gas fraction and decreases the star formation of the galaxies down to a state of quiescence. In addition to AGN feedback, we also investigate the influence of the large-scale environment. While mergers do not play a significant role in the quenching process, the quenched galaxies tend to reside in more massive halos and denser regions during their evolution. As this provides a greater initial amount of infalling gas to the galaxies, the large-scale environment can mildly affect the fate of the central SMBH growth and, via AGN feedback, contribute to star formation quenching.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO Project: Galaxy clusters in comparison to X-ray observations</title>

Abstract: Galaxy clusters are important probes for both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We test the cosmological, hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulations by comparing to observations of the gaseous properties of clusters measured from X-ray observations. FLAMINGO contains unprecedented numbers of massive galaxy groups ($&gt;10^6$) and clusters ($&gt;10^5$) and includes variations in both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We predict the evolution of cluster scaling relations as well as radial profiles of the temperature, density, pressure, entropy, and metallicity for different masses and redshifts. We show that the differences between volume-, and X-ray-weighting of particles in the simulations, and between cool-core non cool-core samples, are similar in size as the differences between simulations for which the stellar and AGN feedback has been calibrated to produce significantly different gas fractions. Compared to thermally-driven AGN feedback, kinetic jet feedback calibrated to produce the same gas fraction at $R_{\rm 500c}$ yields a hotter core with higher entropies and lower densities, which translates into a smaller fraction of cool-core clusters. Stronger feedback, calibrated to produce lower gas fractions and hence lower gas densities, results in higher temperatures, entropies, and metallicities, but lower pressures. The scaling relations and thermodynamic profiles show almost no evolution with respect to self-similar expectations, except for the metallicity decreasing with redshift. We find that the temperature, density, pressure, and entropy profiles of clusters in the fiducial FLAMINGO simulation are in excellent agreement with observations, while the metallicities in the core are too high.</description>

Abstract: The JWST is allowing new measurements of gas-phase metallicities in galaxies between cosmic noon and cosmic dawn through observations of multiple rest-frame optical/ultraviolet [OIII], [OII], and hydrogen Balmer series lines. The most robust approach to such measurements uses luminosity ratios between the excited auroral transition, [OIII] 4364A, and the lower [OIII] 5008A/4960A lines to determine the gas temperature. The ratio of the luminosities in the latter transitions to those in hydrogen Balmer series lines then yield relatively clean metallicity estimates. In the absence of detection of the, often faint, [OIII] auroral line, however, the ratios of various [OIII], [OII], [NII], and Balmer lines are instead used to determine metallicities. Here we present a refined approach for extracting metallicities from these ``strong line diagnostics''. Our method exploits empirical correlations between the temperature of OIII/OII regions and gas-phase metallicity, which lie close to theoretical expectations from thermal equilibrium calculations. We then show, from first principles, how to extract metallicities from traditional strong line diagnostics, R2, R3, R23, O3O2, and N2O2. We show that these ratios depend also on ionization correction factors, but that these can be determined self-consistently along with the metallicities. We quantify the success of our method using metallicities derived from galaxies with auroral line determinations and show that it generally works better than previous empirical approaches. The scatter in the observed line ratios and redshift evolution are largely explained by O3O2 variations. We provide publicly available routines for extracting metallicities from strong line diagnostics using our methodology.</description>

      <title>From gas to stars: MUSEings on the internal evolution of IC 1613</title>

Abstract: The kinematics and chemical composition of stellar populations of different ages provide crucial information about the evolution of a galaxy. We aim to provide such information for IC 1613, an isolated, gas-rich, star-forming dwarf galaxy in the Local Group. We present here the results of a new spectroscopic study performed with MUSE, an integral-field spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope. We extracted from the data cubes more than 2000 sources from which we separated stellar objects for further spectroscopic analysis. The quality of the data set allowed us to obtain accurate classifications and line-of-sight velocities for about 800 stars. Our sample includes not only Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Main Sequence (MS) stars, but also a number of probable Be and C stars. We also obtained reliable metallicities for about 300 RGB stars. The kinematic analysis revealed for the first time the presence of stellar rotation with high significance. We found general agreement with the rotation velocity of the neutral gas component. Examining the kinematics of stars as a function of broad age ranges, we find that the velocity dispersion increases as a function of age, with the behaviour being very clear in the outermost pointings, while the rotation-to-velocity dispersion support decreases. On timescales shorter than a Gyr, the stellar kinematics still follow very closely that of the neutral gas, while the two components decouple on longer timescales. The chemical analysis of the RGB stars revealed average properties comparable to other Local Group dwarf galaxies. We also provide a new estimation of the inclination angle using only independent stellar tracers. Our work provides the largest spectroscopic sample of an isolated LG dwarf galaxy. The results obtained seem to support the scenario in which the stars of a dwarf galaxy are born from a less turbulent gas over time.</description>

      <title>The Low-Mass Stellar Initial Mass Function in Nearby Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses that form in a given star formation event. The long main-sequence lifetimes of low-mass stars mean that the IMF in this regime (below $\sim 1 \rm{M}_\odot$) can be investigated through star counts. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies are low-luminosity systems with ancient, metal-poor stellar populations. We investigate the low-mass IMF in four such systems (Reticulum II, Ursa Major II, Triangulum II, and Segue 1), using Hubble Space Telescope imaging data that reaches to $\lesssim 0.2 \rm{M}_\odot$ in each galaxy. The analysis techniques that we adopt depend on the number of low-mass stars in each sample. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for all four galaxies to determine whether their observed apparent magnitude distributions can reject a given combination of IMF parameters and binary fraction for the underlying population. We forward model 1000 synthetic populations for each combination of parameters, and reject those parameters only if each of the 1000 realizations reject the null hypothesis. We find that all four galaxies reject a variety of IMFs, and the IMFs that they cannot reject include those that are identical, or similar, to that of the stellar populations of the Milky Way. We determine the best-fit parameter values for the IMF in Reticulum II and Ursa Major II and find that the IMF in Reticulum II is generally consistent with that of the Milky Way, while the IMF in Ursa Major II is more bottom heavy. The interpretation of the results for Ursa Major II is complicated by possible contamination from two known background galaxy clusters.</description>

Abstract: Context. Open clusters provide valuable information on stellar nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their age and distances can be measured more precisely with photometry than for field stars. Aims. Our aim is to study the chemical distribution of the Galactic disc using open clusters by analysing the existence of gradients with Galactocentric distance, azimuth or height from the plane and dependency with age. Methods. High-resolution spectra (R&gt;60 000) of 194 stars belonging to 36 open clusters are used to determine atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances with two independent methods: equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. The sample has been complemented with 63 clusters with high-resolution spectroscopy from literature. Results. We measure local thermodynamic equilibrium abundances for 21 elements: {\alpha} (Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti), odd-Z (Na and Al), Fe-peak (Fe, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn), and neutron-capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, and Nd). We also provide non-local thermodynamic equilibrium abundances for elements when corrections are available. We find inner disc young clusters enhanced in [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] compared to other clusters of their age. For [Ba/Fe] we report an age trend flattening for older clusters (age&lt;2.5 Ga). The studied elements follow the expected radial gradients as a function of their nucleosynthesis groups, which are significantly steeper for the oldest systems. For the first time, we investigate the existence of an azimuthal gradient, finding some hints of its existence among the old clusters (age&gt;2 Ga).</description>

      <title>Resonance coupling in spiral arms: Patterns for flat rotation curve</title>

Abstract: To address questions about the physical nature and origin of spiral arms in galaxies, it is necessary to measure their dynamical properties, such as the angular speed, $\Omega_p$, or the corotation radius. Observations suggest that galaxies may contain several independent spiral patterns simultaneously. It was shown that so-called non-linear resonance coupling plays an important role in such systems. We aim to identify cases of independent spiral patterns for galaxies with a flat rotation curve and to investigate what relative pattern velocities they might have for all possible cases of coupling between the main resonances. We solved equations for the main resonance positions (1:1, 2:1, 4:1) and estimated the ratio $\varpi$ of the corotation radii for two subsequent patterns. For six close galaxies with flat rotation curves, we collected the measurements of the corotation radii in the literature, using at least three different methods in each case for credibility. We found at least two independent spiral patterns for each galaxy and measured the $\varpi$ ratios. For three cases, we obtained $\varpi&gt;3$, indicating that it would be difficult to fit two or even more spiral patterns in the disc. These ratios have been used to derive the wind-up time for spirals, estimated to be several galactic rotations. We find that three pairs of coupling cases, including those that have been vastly acknowledged in galaxies, namely, $OLR_{in}=CR_{out} \&amp; CR_{in}=IUHR_{out}$, have very close $\varpi$ ratios; hence, they ought to be found simultaneously, as observed. We find a strongly confirmed apparent resonance coupling for six galaxies and we show that the observed $\varpi$ is in agreement with theory. In two of them, we identified a previously unreported form of simultaneous coupling, namely, $OLR_{in}=OUHR_{out} \&amp; OUHR_{in}=CR_{out}$. This result was also predicted from the proximity of $\varpi$.</description>

      <title>Dark matter particle mass and properties and axion-like dark radiation</title>

Abstract: New approaches are presented for the formation and evolution of nonlinear structures in different eras and suggest a heavy dark matter scenario with a critical particle mass of $10^{12}$GeV. Particles of this mass can have a free streaming mass equal to the particle mass and form the smallest structures among particles of any mass. In the bottom-up approach, via direct collisions, particles of this mass can form the smallest haloes (two particles) as early as $10^{-6}$s in the radiation era with a density ratio of $32\pi^2$ from the spherical collapse model. The halo mass increases to $10^8M_{\odot}$ at the matter-radiation equality, and to $10^{13}M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$. Halo growth eventually slows down due to the self-limiting effects of dark energy. In the top-down approach, the mass and energy cascades are identified that facilitate the hierarchical structure formation. A scale-independent rate of energy cascade $\varepsilon_u=10^{-7}m^2/s^3$ can be identified. The energy cascade leads to universal scalings on scales $r$, i.e. a two-thirds law for kinetic energy ($v_r^2\propto \varepsilon_u^{2/3}r^{2/3}$) and a four-thirds law for halo density ($\rho_r\propto\varepsilon_u^{2/3}G^{-1}r^{-4/3}$). By extending these scalings down to the smallest structure scale, we can estimate the particle mass $m_X=(\varepsilon_u\hbar^5G^{-4})^{1/9}=10^{12}$GeV, size $l_X=(\varepsilon_u^{-1}\hbar G)^{1/3}=10^{-13}$m, and a characteristic time $\tau_X=c^2/\varepsilon_u=10^{16}$yrs. Here $\hbar$ is the Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light. The binding energy $E_X=(\varepsilon_u^5\hbar^7G^{-2})^{1/9}=10^{-9}$eV suggests a dark radiation field. The axion-like dark radiation should be produced at time $t_X=(\varepsilon_u^{-5}\hbar^2G^2)^{1/9}=10^{-6}$s with a mass of $10^{-9}$eV or a GUT scale decay constant $10^{16}$GeV and an energy density 1% of CMB photons.</description>

Abstract: Till today, the nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains elusive despite all our efforts. This missing matter of the universe has not been observed by the already operating DM direct-detection experiments, but we can infer its gravitational effects. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies are most likely to contain DM trapped to their gravitational field. This leads us to the natural assumption that compact objects might contain DM too. Among the compact objects exist in galaxies, neutron stars are considered as natural laboratories, where theories can be tested, and observational data can be received. Thus, many models of DM have proposed it's presence in those stars. In particular, in the present study we focus on two types of dark matter particles, namely fermions and bosons with a mass range of [0.01-1.5] GeV and self-interaction strength in the range [10$^{-4}$-10$^{-1}$] MeV$^{-1}$. By employing the two-fluid model, we discovered a stable area in the M-R diagram of a celestial formation consisting of neutron star matter and DM that is substantial in size. This formation spans hundreds of kilometers in diameter and possesses a mass equivalent to 100 or more times the Solar mass. To elucidate, this entity resembles an enormous celestial body of DM, with a neutron star at its core. This implies that a supramassive stellar compact entity can exist without encountering any issues of stability and without undergoing a collapse into a black hole. In any case, the present theoretical prediction can, if combined with corresponding observations, shed light on the existence of DM and even more on its basic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An hourglass-shaped magnetic field pattern arises naturally from the gravitational collapse of a star-forming gas cloud. Most studies have focused on the prestellar collapse phase, when the structure has a smooth and monotonic radial profile. However, most observations target dense clouds that already contain a central protostar, and possibly a circumstellar disk. We utilize an analytic treatment of the magnetic field along with insights gained from simulations to develop a more realistic magnetic field model for the protostellar phase. Key elements of the model are a strong radial magnetic field in the region of rapid collapse, an off-center peak in the magnetic field strength (a consequence of magnetic field dissipation in the circumstellar disk), and a strong toroidal field that is generated in the region of rapid collapse and outflow generation. A model with a highly pinched and twisted magnetic field pattern in the inner collapse zone facilitates the interpretation of magnetic field patterns observed in protostellar clouds.</description>
