      <title>Process mining for self-regulated learning assessment in e-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content assessment has broadly improved in e-learning scenarios in recent decades. However, the eLearning process can give rise to a spatial and temporal gap that poses interesting challenges for assessment of not only content, but also students' acquisition of core skills such as self-regulated learning. Our objective was to discover students' self-regulated learning processes during an eLearning course by using Process Mining Techniques. We applied a new algorithm in the educational domain called Inductive Miner over the interaction traces from 101 university students in a course given over one semester on the Moodle 2.0 platform. Data was extracted from the platform's event logs with 21629 traces in order to discover students' self-regulation models that contribute to improving the instructional process. The Inductive Miner algorithm discovered optimal models in terms of fitness for both Pass and Fail students in this dataset, as well as models at a certain level of granularity that can be interpreted in educational terms, which are the most important achievement in model discovery. We can conclude that although students who passed did not follow the instructors' suggestions exactly, they did follow the logic of a successful self-regulated learning process as opposed to their failing classmates. The Process Mining models also allow us to examine which specific actions the students performed, and it was particularly interesting to see a high presence of actions related to forum-supported collaborative learning in the Pass group and an absence of those in the Fail group.</description>

      <title>Fairness Evaluation for Uplift Modeling in the Absence of Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acceleration in the adoption of AI-based automated decision-making systems poses a challenge for evaluating the fairness of algorithmic decisions, especially in the absence of ground truth. When designing interventions, uplift modeling is used extensively to identify candidates that are likely to benefit from treatment. However, these models remain particularly susceptible to fairness evaluation due to the lack of ground truth on the outcome measure since a candidate cannot be in both treatment and control simultaneously. In this article, we propose a framework that overcomes the missing ground truth problem by generating surrogates to serve as a proxy for counterfactual labels of uplift modeling campaigns. We then leverage the surrogate ground truth to conduct a more comprehensive binary fairness evaluation. We show how to apply the approach in a comprehensive study from a real-world marketing campaign for promotional offers and demonstrate its enhancement for fairness evaluation.</description>

      <title>Ambivalence in stakeholders' views on connected and autonomous vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are often discussed as a solution to pressing issues of the current transport systems, including congestion, safety, social inclusion and ecological sustainability. Scientifically, there is agreement that CAVs may solve, but can also aggravate these issues, depending on the specific CAV solution. In the current paper, we investigate the visions and worst-case scenarios of various stakeholders, including representatives of public administrations, automotive original equipment manufacturers, insurance companies, public transportation service providers, mobility experts and politicians. A qualitative analysis of 17 semi-structured interviews is presented. It reveals experts' ambivalence towards the introduction of CAVs, reflecting high levels of uncertainty about CAV consequences, including issues of efficiency, comfort and sustainability, and concerns about road co-users such as pedestrians and cyclists. Implications of the sluggishness of policymakers to set boundary conditions and for the labor market are discussed. An open debate between policymakers, citizens and other stakeholders on how to introduce CAVs seems timely.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Education with GenAI: A New Horizon in Lesson Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Generative AI (GenAI) in education presents a transformative approach to traditional teaching methodologies, which often overlook the diverse needs of individual students. This study introduces a GenAI tool, based on advanced natural language processing, designed as a digital assistant for educators, enabling the creation of customized lesson plans. The tool utilizes an innovative feature termed 'interactive mega-prompt,' a comprehensive query system that allows educators to input detailed classroom specifics such as student demographics, learning objectives, and preferred teaching styles. This input is then processed by the GenAI to generate tailored lesson plans. To evaluate the tool's effectiveness, a comprehensive methodology incorporating both quantitative (i.e., % of time savings) and qualitative (i.e., user satisfaction) criteria was implemented, spanning various subjects and educational levels, with continuous feedback collected from educators through a structured evaluation form. Preliminary results show that educators find the GenAI-generated lesson plans effective, significantly reducing lesson planning time and enhancing the learning experience by accommodating diverse student needs. This AI-driven approach signifies a paradigm shift in education, suggesting its potential applicability in broader educational contexts, including special education needs (SEN), where individualized attention and specific learning aids are paramount</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Social-Network-Based eHealth Intervention on the Improvement of Healthy Habits among Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study shows the feasibility of an eHealth solution for tackling eating habits and physical activity in the adolescent population. The participants were children from 11 to 15 years old. An intervention was carried out on 139 students in the intervention group and 91 students in the control group, in two schools during 14 weeks. The intervention group had access to the web through a user account and a password. They were able to create friendship relationships, post comments, give likes and interact with other users, as well as receive notifications and information about nutrition and physical activity on a daily basis and get (virtual) rewards for improving their habits. The control group did not have access to any of these features. The homogeneity of the samples in terms of gender, age, body mass index and initial health-related habits was demonstrated. Pre- and post-measurements were collected through self-reports on the application website. After applying multivariate analysis of variance, a significant alteration in the age-adjusted body mass index percentile was observed in the intervention group versus the control group, as well as in the PAQ-A score and the KIDMED score. It can be concluded that eHealth interventions can help to obtain healthy habits. More research is needed to examine the effectiveness in achieving adherence to these new habits.</description>

      <title>Beyond Quantities: Machine Learning-based Characterization of Inequality in Infrastructure Quality Provision in Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to characterize inequality in infrastructure quality across urban areas. While a growing of body of literature has recognized the importance of characterizing infrastructure inequality in cities and provided quantified metrics to inform urban development plans, the majority of the existing approaches focus primarily on measuring the quantity of infrastructure, assuming that more infrastructure is better. Also, the existing research focuses primarily on index-based approaches in which the status of infrastructure provision in urban areas is determined based on assumed subjective weights. The focus on infrastructure quantity and use of indices obtained from subjective weights has hindered the ability to properly examine infrastructure inequality as it pertains to urban inequality and environmental justice considerations. Recognizing this gap, we propose a machine learning-based approach in which infrastructure features that shape environmental hazard exposure are identified and we use the weights obtained by the model to calculate an infrastructure quality provision for spatial areas of cities and accordingly, quantify the extent of inequality in infrastructure quality. The implementation of the model in five metropolitan areas in the U.S. demonstrates the capability of the proposed approach in characterizing inequality in infrastructure quality and capturing city-specific differences in the weights of infrastructure features. The results also show that areas in which low-income populations reside have lower infrastructure quality provision, suggesting the lower infrastructure quality provision as a determinant of urban disparities. Accordingly, the proposed approach can be effectively used to inform integrated urban design strategies to promote infrastructure equity and environmental justice based on data-driven and machine intelligence-based insights.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Nibbler: An Open Red-Teaming Method for Identifying Diverse Harms in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of text-to-image (T2I) generative AI models reaching wide audiences, it is critical to evaluate model robustness against non-obvious attacks to mitigate the generation of offensive images. By focusing on ``implicitly adversarial'' prompts (those that trigger T2I models to generate unsafe images for non-obvious reasons), we isolate a set of difficult safety issues that human creativity is well-suited to uncover. To this end, we built the Adversarial Nibbler Challenge, a red-teaming methodology for crowdsourcing a diverse set of implicitly adversarial prompts. We have assembled a suite of state-of-the-art T2I models, employed a simple user interface to identify and annotate harms, and engaged diverse populations to capture long-tail safety issues that may be overlooked in standard testing. The challenge is run in consecutive rounds to enable a sustained discovery and analysis of safety pitfalls in T2I models.
  In this paper, we present an in-depth account of our methodology, a systematic study of novel attack strategies and discussion of safety failures revealed by challenge participants. We also release a companion visualization tool for easy exploration and derivation of insights from the dataset. The first challenge round resulted in over 10k prompt-image pairs with machine annotations for safety. A subset of 1.5k samples contains rich human annotations of harm types and attack styles. We find that 14% of images that humans consider harmful are mislabeled as ``safe'' by machines. We have identified new attack strategies that highlight the complexity of ensuring T2I model robustness. Our findings emphasize the necessity of continual auditing and adaptation as new vulnerabilities emerge. We are confident that this work will enable proactive, iterative safety assessments and promote responsible development of T2I models.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Image Generation in Cyber Influence Operations: An Emergent Threat?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has catalyzed a transformation in digital content generation, with profound implications for cyber influence operations. This report delves into the potential and limitations of generative deep learning models, such as diffusion models, in fabricating convincing synthetic images. We critically assess the accessibility, practicality, and output quality of these tools and their implications in threat scenarios of deception, influence, and subversion. Notably, the report generates content for several hypothetical cyber influence operations to demonstrate the current capabilities and limitations of these AI-driven methods for threat actors. While generative models excel at producing illustrations and non-realistic imagery, creating convincing photo-realistic content remains a significant challenge, limited by computational resources and the necessity for human-guided refinement. Our exploration underscores the delicate balance between technological advancement and its potential for misuse, prompting recommendations for ongoing research, defense mechanisms, multi-disciplinary collaboration, and policy development. These recommendations aim to leverage AI's potential for positive impact while safeguarding against its risks to the integrity of information, especially in the context of cyber influence.</description>

      <title>Analyzing-Evaluating-Creating: Assessing Computational Thinking and Problem Solving in Visual Programming Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills are increasingly integrated into K-8 school curricula worldwide. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop reliable assessments for measuring students' proficiency in these skills. Recent works have proposed tests for assessing these skills across various CT concepts and practices, in particular, based on multi-choice items enabling psychometric validation and usage in large-scale studies. Despite their practical relevance, these tests are limited in how they measure students' computational creativity, a crucial ability when applying CT and problem solving in real-world settings. In our work, we have developed ACE, a novel test focusing on the three higher cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, i.e., Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. ACE comprises a diverse set of 7x3 multi-choice items spanning these three levels, grounded in elementary block-based visual programming. We evaluate the psychometric properties of ACE through a study conducted with 371 students in grades 3-7 from 10 schools. Based on several psychometric analysis frameworks, our results confirm the reliability and validity of ACE. Our study also shows a positive correlation between students' performance on ACE and performance on Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org.</description>

      <title>Fostering Inclusion: A Regional Initiative Uniting Communities to Co-Design Assistive Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People with disabilities often face discrimination and lack of access in all areas of society. While improving the affordability and appropriateness of assistive technologies can pave the way for easier participation and independence, awareness and acceptance of disability as part of society are inevitable. The presented regional initiative strives to tackle these problems by bringing together people with disabilities, students, researchers, and associations. During different lecture formats at the university, students co-design assistive technologies with people with disabilities. After one year in practice, we reflect on the initiative and its impact on assistive technology development and mitigation of ableism. We conducted and analyzed thirteen semi-structured interviews with participants and other involved stakeholders. Not all co-design projects were finished within the time of a lecture. Participants nevertheless appreciated the co-design approach and steps in the right direction as projects are continued in upcoming semesters. Interviewees highlighted the initiative's importance in raising awareness and broadening knowledge regarding disability and internalized ableist assumptions for those participating. We conclude that collaboration, continuity, and public outreach are most important to work towards tangible assistive technologies, bridging accessibility gaps, and fostering a more inclusive society.</description>

      <title>Preventing Eviction-Caused Homelessness through ML-Informed Distribution of Rental Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rental assistance programs provide individuals with financial assistance to prevent housing instabilities caused by evictions and avert homelessness. Since these programs operate under resource constraints, they must decide who to prioritize. Typically, funding is distributed by a reactive or first-come-first serve allocation process that does not systematically consider risk of future homelessness. We partnered with Allegheny County, PA to explore a proactive allocation approach that prioritizes individuals facing eviction based on their risk of future homelessness. Our ML system that uses state and county administrative data to accurately identify individuals in need of support outperforms simpler prioritization approaches by at least 20% while being fair and equitable across race and gender. Furthermore, our approach would identify 28% of individuals who are overlooked by the current process and end up homeless. Beyond improvements to the rental assistance program in Allegheny County, this study can inform the development of evidence-based decision support tools in similar contexts, including lessons about data needs, model design, evaluation, and field validation.</description>

      <title>Is open source software culture enough to make AI a common ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LM or LLM) are increasingly deployed in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications, but the question arises as to whether they can be a common resource managed and maintained by a community of users. Indeed, the dominance of private companies with exclusive access to massive data and language processing resources can create inequalities and biases in LM, as well as obstacles to innovation for those who do not have the same resources necessary for their implementation. In this contribution, we examine the concept of the commons and its relevance for thinking about LM. We highlight the potential benefits of treating the data and resources needed to create LMs as commons, including increased accessibility, equity, and transparency in the development and use of AI technologies. Finally, we present a case study centered on the Hugging Face platform, an open-source platform for deep learning designed to encourage collaboration and sharing among AI designers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much of the research and discourse on risks from artificial intelligence (AI) image generators, such as DALL-E and Midjourney, has centered around whether they could be used to inject false information into political discourse. We show that spammers and scammers - seemingly motivated by profit or clout, not ideology - are already using AI-generated images to gain significant traction on Facebook. At times, the Facebook Feed is recommending unlabeled AI-generated images to users who neither follow the Pages posting the images nor realize that the images are AI-generated, highlighting the need for improved transparency and provenance standards as AI models proliferate.</description>

      <title>Social bots sour activist sentiment without eroding engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have witnessed a substantial increase in social bot activity, significantly affecting online discourse. Our study explores the dynamic nature of bot engagement related to Extinction Rebellion climate change protests from 18 November 2019 to 10 December 2019. We find that bots exert a greater influence on human behavior than vice versa during heated online periods. To assess the causal impact of human-bot communication, we compared communication histories between human users who directly interacted with bots and matched human users who did not. Our findings demonstrate a consistent negative impact of bot interactions on subsequent human sentiment, with exposed users displaying significantly more negative sentiment than their counterparts. Furthermore, the nature of bot interaction influences human tweeting activity and the sentiment towards protests. Political astroturfing bots increase activity, whereas other bots decrease it. Sentiment changes towards protests depend on the user's original support level, indicating targeted manipulation. However, bot interactions do not change activists' engagement towards protests. Despite the seemingly minor impact of individual bot encounters, the cumulative effect is profound due to the large volume of bot communication. Our findings underscore the importance of unrestricted access to social media data for studying the prevalence and influence of social bots, as with new technological advancements distinguishing between bots and humans becomes nearly impossible.</description>

Abstract: Financial market like the price of stock, share, gold, oil, mutual funds are affected by the news and posts on social media. In this work deep learning based models are proposed to predict the trend of financial market based on NLP analysis of the twitter handles of leaders of different fields. There are many models available to predict financial market based on only the historical data of the financial component but combining historical data with news and posts of the social media like Twitter is the main objective of the present work. Substantial improvement is shown in the result. The main features of the present work are: a) proposing completely generalized algorithm which is able to generate models for any twitter handle and any financial component, b) predicting the time window for a tweets effect on a stock price c) analyzing the effect of multiple twitter handles for predicting the trend. A detailed survey is done to find out the latest work in recent years in the similar field, find the research gap, and collect the required data for analysis and prediction. State-of-the-art algorithm is proposed and complete implementation with environment is given. An insightful trend of the result improvement considering the NLP analysis of twitter data on financial market components is shown. The Indian and USA financial markets are explored in the present work where as other markets can be taken in future. The socio-economic impact of the present work is discussed in conclusion.</description>

      <title>Prototipo de video juego activo basado en una c\'amara 3D para motivar la actividad f\'isica en ni\~nos y adultos mayores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12432</link>

Abstract: This document describes the development of a video game prototype designed to encourage physical activity among children and older adults. The prototype consists of a laptop, a camera with 3D sensors, and optionally requires an LCD screen or a projector. The programming component of this prototype was developed in Scratch, a programming language geared towards children, which greatly facilitates the creation of a game tailored to the users' preferences. The idea to create such a prototype originated from the desire to offer an option that promotes physical activity among children and adults, given that a lack of physical exercise is a predominant factor in the development of chronic degenerative diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, to name the most common. As a result of this initiative, an active video game prototype was successfully developed, based on a ping-pong game, which allows both children and adults to interact in a fun way while encouraging the performance of physical activities that can positively impact the users' health.</description>

      <title>FairSIN: Achieving Fairness in Graph Neural Networks through Sensitive Information Neutralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in modeling graph-structured data, like other machine learning models, GNNs are also susceptible to making biased predictions based on sensitive attributes, such as race and gender. For fairness consideration, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods propose to filter out sensitive information from inputs or representations, e.g., edge dropping or feature masking. However, we argue that such filtering-based strategies may also filter out some non-sensitive feature information, leading to a sub-optimal trade-off between predictive performance and fairness. To address this issue, we unveil an innovative neutralization-based paradigm, where additional Fairness-facilitating Features (F3) are incorporated into node features or representations before message passing. The F3 are expected to statistically neutralize the sensitive bias in node representations and provide additional nonsensitive information. We also provide theoretical explanations for our rationale, concluding that F3 can be realized by emphasizing the features of each node's heterogeneous neighbors (neighbors with different sensitive attributes). We name our method as FairSIN, and present three implementation variants from both data-centric and model-centric perspectives. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets with three different GNN backbones show that FairSIN significantly improves fairness metrics while maintaining high prediction accuracies.</description>

      <title>Embodied LLM Agents Learn to Cooperate in Organized Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as integral tools for reasoning, planning, and decision-making, drawing upon their extensive world knowledge and proficiency in language-related tasks. LLMs thus hold tremendous potential for natural language interaction within multi-agent systems to foster cooperation. However, LLM agents tend to over-report and comply with any instruction, which may result in information redundancy and confusion in multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by human organizations, this paper introduces a framework that imposes prompt-based organization structures on LLM agents to mitigate these problems. Through a series of experiments with embodied LLM agents and human-agent collaboration, our results highlight the impact of designated leadership on team efficiency, shedding light on the leadership qualities displayed by LLM agents and their spontaneous cooperative behaviors. Further, we harness the potential of LLMs to propose enhanced organizational prompts, via a Criticize-Reflect process, resulting in novel organization structures that reduce communication costs and enhance team efficiency.</description>

      <title>System Support for Environmentally Sustainable Computing in Data Centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern data centers suffer from a growing carbon footprint due to insufficient support for environmental sustainability. While hardware accelerators and renewable energy have been utilized to enhance sustainability, addressing Quality of Service (QoS) degradation caused by renewable energy supply and hardware recycling remains challenging: (1) prior accelerators exhibit significant carbon footprints due to limited reconfigurability and inability to adapt to renewable energy fluctuations; (2) integrating recycled NAND flash chips in data centers poses challenges due to their short lifetime, increasing energy consumption; (3) the absence of a sustainability estimator impedes data centers and users in evaluating and improving their environmental impact. This study aims to improve system support for environmentally sustainable data centers by proposing a reconfigurable hardware accelerator for intensive computing primitives and developing a fractional NAND flash cell to extend the lifetime of recycled flash chips while supporting graceful capacity degradation. We also introduce a sustainability estimator to evaluate user task energy consumption and promote sustainable practices. We present our preliminary results and recognize this as an ongoing initiative with significant potential to advance environmentally sustainable computing in data centers and stimulate further exploration in this critical research domain.</description>

      <title>ETHNO-DAANN: Ethnographic Engagement Classification by Deep Adversarial Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Student motivation is a key research agenda due to the necessity of both postcolonial education reform and youth job-market adaptation in ongoing fourth industrial revolution. Post-communism era teachers are prompted to analyze student ethnicity information such as background, origin with the aim of providing better education. With the proliferation of smart-device data, ever-increasing demand for distance learning platforms and various survey results of virtual learning, we are fortunate to have some access to student engagement data. In this research, we are motivated to address the following questions: can we predict student engagement from ethnographic information when we have limited labeled knowledge? If the answer is yes, can we tell which features are most influential in ethnographic engagement learning? In this context, we have proposed a deep neural network based transfer learning algorithm ETHNO-DAANN with adversarial adaptation for ethnographic engagement prediction. We conduct a survey among participants about ethnicity-based student motivation to figure out the most influential feature helpful in final prediction. Thus, our research stands as a general solution for ethnographic motivation parameter estimation in case of limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Privacy Perceptions and Behaviors of Google Personal Account Holders in Saudi Arabia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While privacy perceptions and behaviors have been investigated in Western societies, little is known about these issues in non-Western societies. To bridge this gap, we interviewed 30 Google personal account holders in Saudi Arabia about their privacy perceptions and behaviors regarding the activity data that Google saves about them. Our study focuses on Google's Activity Controls, which enable users to control whether, and how, Google saves their Web \&amp; App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History. Our results show that although most participants have some level of awareness about Google's data practices and the Activity Controls, many have only vague awareness, and the majority have not used the available controls. When participants viewed their saved activity data, many were surprised by what had been saved. While many participants find Google's use of their data to improve the services provided to them acceptable, the majority find the use of their data for ad purposes unacceptable. We observe that our Saudi participants exhibit similar trends and patterns in privacy awareness, attitudes, preferences, concerns, and behaviors to what has been found in studies in the US. Our results emphasize the need for: 1) improved techniques to inform users about privacy settings during account sign-up, to remind users about their settings, and to raise awareness about privacy settings; 2) improved privacy setting interfaces to reduce the costs that deter many users from changing the settings; and 3) further research to explore privacy concerns in non-Western cultures.</description>

      <title>AI-enhanced Collective Intelligence: The State of the Art and Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current societal challenges exceed the capacity of human individual or collective effort alone. As AI evolves, its role within human collectives is poised to vary from an assistive tool to a participatory member. Humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, when synergized, can achieve a level of collective intelligence that surpasses the collective capabilities of either humans or AI in isolation. However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This review incorporates perspectives from network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising a cognition layer, a physical layer, and an information layer. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism. The interplay among these agents shapes the overall structure and dynamics of the system. We explore how agents' diversity and interactions influence the system's collective intelligence. Furthermore, we present an analysis of real-world instances of AI-enhanced collective intelligence. We conclude by addressing the potential challenges in AI-enhanced collective intelligence and offer perspectives on future developments in this field.</description>

      <title>Safety Cases: How to Justify the Safety of Advanced AI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI systems become more advanced, companies and regulators will make difficult decisions about whether it is safe to train and deploy them. To prepare for these decisions, we investigate how developers could make a 'safety case,' which is a structured rationale that AI systems are unlikely to cause a catastrophe. We propose a framework for organizing a safety case and discuss four categories of arguments to justify safety: total inability to cause a catastrophe, sufficiently strong control measures, trustworthiness despite capability to cause harm, and -- if AI systems become much more powerful -- deference to credible AI advisors. We evaluate concrete examples of arguments in each category and outline how arguments could be combined to justify that AI systems are safe to deploy.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh Agricultural Knowledge Graph: Enabling Semantic Integration and Data-driven Analysis--Full Version</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Bangladesh, agriculture is a crucial driver for addressing Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) and 2 (Zero Hunger), playing a fundamental role in the economy and people's livelihoods. To enhance the sustainability and resilience of the agriculture industry through data-driven insights, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and other organizations consistently collect and publish agricultural data on the Web. Nevertheless, the current datasets encounter various challenges: 1) they are presented in an unsustainable, static, read-only, and aggregated format, 2) they do not conform to the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles, and 3) they do not facilitate interactive analysis and integration with other data sources. In this paper, we present a thorough solution, delineating a systematic procedure for developing BDAKG: a knowledge graph that semantically and analytically integrates agriculture data in Bangladesh. BDAKG incorporates multidimensional semantics, is linked with external knowledge graphs, is compatible with OLAP, and adheres to the FAIR principles. Our experimental evaluation centers on evaluating the integration process and assessing the quality of the resultant knowledge graph in terms of completeness, timeliness, FAIRness, OLAP compatibility and data-driven analysis. Our federated data analysis recommend a strategic approach focused on decreasing CO$_2$ emissions, fostering economic growth, and promoting sustainable forestry.</description>

Abstract: Education is a right of all, however, every individual is different than others. Teachers in post-communism era discover inherent individualism to equally train all towards job market of fourth industrial revolution. We can consider scenario of ethnic minority education in academic practices. Ethnic minority group has grown in their own culture and would prefer to be taught in their native way. We have formulated such linguistic anthropology(how people learn)based engagement as semi-supervised problem. Then, we have developed an conditional deep generative adversarial network algorithm namely LA-GAN to classify linguistic ethnographic features in student engagement. Theoretical justification proves the objective, regularization and loss function of our semi-supervised adversarial model. Survey questions are prepared to reach some form of assumptions about z-generation and ethnic minority group, whose learning style, learning approach and preference are our main area of interest.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid accumulation of online information, efficient web navigation has grown vital yet challenging. To create an easily navigable cyberspace catering to diverse demographics, understanding how people navigate differently is paramount. While previous research has unveiled individual differences in spatial navigation, such differences in knowledge space navigation remain sparse. To bridge this gap, we conducted an online experiment where participants played a navigation game on Wikipedia and completed personal information questionnaires. Our analysis shows that age negatively affects knowledge space navigation performance, while multilingualism enhances it. Under time pressure, participants' performance improves across trials and males outperform females, an effect not observed in games without time pressure. In our experiment, successful route-finding is usually not related to abilities of innovative exploration of routes. Our results underline the importance of age, multilingualism and time constraint in the knowledge space navigation.</description>

      <title>Predicting Generalization of AI Colonoscopy Models to Unseen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Generalizability of AI colonoscopy algorithms is important for wider adoption in clinical practice. However, current techniques for evaluating performance on unseen data require expensive and time-intensive labels.
  Methods: We use a "Masked Siamese Network" (MSN) to identify novel phenomena in unseen data and predict polyp detector performance. MSN is trained to predict masked out regions of polyp images, without any labels. We test MSN's ability to be trained on data only from Israel and detect unseen techniques, narrow-band imaging (NBI) and chromendoscoy (CE), on colonoscopes from Japan (354 videos, 128 hours). We also test MSN's ability to predict performance of Computer Aided Detection (CADe) of polyps on colonoscopies from both countries, even though MSN is not trained on data from Japan.
  Results: MSN correctly identifies NBI and CE as less similar to Israel whitelight than Japan whitelight (bootstrapped z-test, |z| &gt; 496, p &lt; 10^-8 for both) using the label-free Frechet distance. MSN detects NBI with 99% accuracy, predicts CE better than our heuristic (90% vs 79% accuracy) despite being trained only on whitelight, and is the only method that is robust to noisy labels. MSN predicts CADe polyp detector performance on in-domain Israel and out-of-domain Japan colonoscopies (r=0.79, 0.37 respectively). With few examples of Japan detector performance to train on, MSN prediction of Japan performance improves (r=0.56).
  Conclusion: Our technique can identify distribution shifts in clinical data and can predict CADe detector performance on unseen data, without labels. Our self-supervised approach can aid in detecting when data in practice is different from training, such as between hospitals or data has meaningfully shifted from training. MSN has potential for application to medical image domains beyond colonoscopy.</description>
