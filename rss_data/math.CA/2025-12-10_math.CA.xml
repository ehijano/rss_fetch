      <title>Power loss for the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture on $C^k$ convex hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a family of compact $C^k$ hypersurfaces where the local Mizohata-Takeuchi Conjecture fails with a power loss of $R^{\alpha}$ for any $\alpha&lt;\frac{n-1}{n-1+k}$. Moreover, this family is dense in the $C^k$ topology, and so the local Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture fails for many convex hypersurfaces. In particular, the local Mizohata-Takeuchi Conjecture fails with a power loss of $R^\alpha$ for any $\alpha&lt;\frac{n-1}{n+1}$ for many $C^2$ convex hypersurfaces. This power matches the best known upper bound in a paper by Tony Carbery, Marina Iliopoulou and Hong Wang up to the endpoint. For the proof, our weight is positive definite as in the first author's recent $\log(R)$-loss counterexample, and our construction is based on a projection of a higher rank lattice. As a by-product, we also construct compact convex $C^2$ hypersurfaces whose rescaling contains many lattice points in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Some Difference Relations for Orthogonal Polynomials of a Continuous Variable in the Askey Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal polynomials of a continuous variable in the Askey scheme satisfying second order difference equations, such as the Askey-Wilson polynomial, can be studied by the quantum mechanical formulation, idQM (discrete quantum mechanics with pure imaginary shifts). These idQM systems have the shape invariance property, which relates the Hilbert space $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda}$ ($\lambda$ : a set of parameters) and that with shifted parameters $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda+\delta}$ ($\delta$ : shift of $\lambda$), and gives the forward and backward shift relations for the orthogonal polynomials. Based on the forward shift relation and the Christoffel's theorem with some polynomial $\check{\Phi}(x)$, which is expressed in terms of the quantities appeared in the forward and backward shift relations, we obtain some difference relations for the orthogonal polynomials. The multiplication of $\sqrt{\check{\Phi}(x)}$ gives a surjective map from $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda+2\delta}$ to $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda}$. Similarly, for the orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme satisfying second order differential equations, such as the Jacobi polynomial, we obtain some differential relations, and the multiplication of $\sqrt{\check{\Phi}(x)}$ in this case gives a surjective map from $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda+\delta}$ to $\mathsf{H}_{\lambda}$.</description>

      <title>A constrained approximation theorem for integral functionals on $L^p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(T,{\cal F},\mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space, $E$ a separable real Banach space and $p\geq 1$. Given a sequence of functions $f, f_1, f_2,...$ from $T\times E$ to ${\bf R}$, under general assumptions, we prove that, for each closed hyperplane $V$ of $L^p(T,E)$, for each $u\in V$, and for each sequence $\{\lambda_n\}$ converging to $\int_Tf(t,u(t))d\mu$, there exists a sequence $\{u_n\}$ in $V$ converging to $u$ and such that $\int_Tf_n(t,u_n(t))d\mu=\lambda_n$ for all $n$ large enough.</description>

      <title>Raimi's theorem for manifolds with circle symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raimi's classical theorem establishes a partition of the natural numbers with a remarkable unavoidability property: for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there is a color class whose translate meets both parts of the partition in infinitely many points. Recently, Kang, Koh, and Tran have extended this phenomenon to the circle group, proving that there exists a measurable partition of the circle such that every finite measurable cover admits a rotation whose image meets each part of the partition in positive measure. This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold. Our approach is unified through a general circle-bundle theorem, which reduces all three geometric cases to verifying suitable equivariance and product disintegration properties of the surface measure.</description>

      <title>Geometric approach for the identification of Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some new Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type are presented and the analogue of Okamoto's space of initial conditions computed. Using the geometric approach that was introduced originally for the identification problem of Painlev\'e equations, comparing the irreducible components of the inaccessible divisors arising in the blow-up process, we find bi-rational coordinate changes between some of these systems that give rise to the same global Hamiltonian structure. This scheme thus gives a method for identifying Hamiltonian systems up to bi-rational maps, which is performed in this article for systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type having singularities that are either square-root type algebraic poles or ordinary poles.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of frequency-localized functions from pointwise samples via least squares and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering frequency-localized functions from pointwise data is a fundamental task in signal processing. We examine this problem from an approximation-theoretic perspective, focusing on least squares and deep learning-based methods. First, we establish a novel recovery theorem for least squares approximations using the Slepian basis from uniform random samples in low dimensions, explicitly tracking the dependence of the bandwidth on the sampling complexity. Building on these results, we then present a recovery guarantee for approximating bandlimited functions via deep learning from pointwise data. This result, framed as a practical existence theorem, provides conditions on the network architecture, training procedure, and data acquisition sufficient for accurate approximation. To complement our theoretical findings, we perform numerical comparisons between least squares and deep learning for approximating one- and two-dimensional functions. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical limitations and the practical gaps between theory and implementation.</description>

      <title>Spaces of initial conditions for quartic Hamiltonian systems of Painlev\'e and quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric approach for Painlev\'e and quasi-Painlev\'e differential equations in the complex plane is applied to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems, quartic in the dependent variables. By computing their defining manifolds (analogue of the Okamoto's space of initial conditions in the quasi-Painlev\'e case), we provide a classification of such systems. We distinguish the various cases by the local behaviour at the movable singularities of the solutions, which are algebraic poles or ordinary poles. The principal cases are categorised by the initial base points of the system in the extended phase space $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and their multiplicities, arising from the coalescence of $4$ simple base points in the generic case. Through the mechanisms of coalescence of base points and degeneration (by setting certain coefficient functions in the Hamiltonian to $0$), all possible sub-cases of quartic Hamiltonian systems with the quasi-Painlev\'e property are obtained, and are characterised by their corresponding Newton polygons. As particular sub-cases we recover certain systems equivalent to known Painlev\'e equations, or variants thereof. The resulting picture is a multi-faceted description of each case: the local behaviour around singularities, the surface type, and the Newton polygon.</description>
