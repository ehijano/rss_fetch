      <title>Emergence of advection-diffusion transport structure and nonlinear amplitude evolution of strongly driven instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instabilities driven by strong gradients appear in a wide variety of physical systems, including plasmas, neutral fluids, and self-gravitating systems. This work develops an analytic formulation to describe the transport structure and nonlinear amplitude evolution of a discrete, strongly driven instability in the presence of energy sources and sinks. Initially, the mode is found to evolve linearly until the gradient in the distribution has been exhausted. It then transitions to a nonlinear phase governed by a Bernoulli differential equation, for which a closed-form analytic solution is found, and continues to evolve until the energy sources and sinks reach equilibrium. During the nonlinear phase, the leading order distribution function is found to persistently satisfy an advection-diffusion equation in time and energy coordinates. These analytical results are shown to agree closely with nonlinear kinetic simulations and to be readily applicable in the study of resonant transport in plasmas, galaxies and viscous shear flows.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Current and Vorticity Structures in Relativistic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent structures created through turbulent cascades play a key role in energy dissipation and particle acceleration. In this work, we investigate both current and vorticity sheets in 3D particle-in-cell simulations of decaying relativistic turbulence in pair plasma by training a self-organizing map to recognize these structures. We subsequently carry out an extensive statistical analysis to reveal their geometric and structural properties. This analysis is systematically applied across a range of magnetizations ($\sigma$) and fluctuating-to-mean magnetic field strengths ($\delta B_0/B_0$) to assess how these parameters influence the resulting structures. We find that the structures' geometric properties form power-law distributions in their probability density functions (PDFs), with the exception of the structure width, which generally exhibits an exponential distribution peaking around 2 electron skin depths. The measurements show weak dependence on $\sigma$ but a strong dependence on $\delta B_0/B_0$. Finally, we investigate the spatial relationship between current sheets and vorticity sheets. We find that most current sheets are directly associated with at least one vorticity sheet neighbor and are often situated between two vorticity sheets. These findings provide a detailed statistical framework for understanding the formation and organization of coherent structures in relativistic magnetized turbulence, allowing for their incorporation into updated theoretical models for structure-based energy dissipation and particle acceleration processes crucial for interpreting high-energy astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Long Living Hot and Dense Plasma from Relativistic Laser-Nanowire Array Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09437v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-living, hot and dense plasmas generated by ultra-intense laser beams are of critical importance for laser-driven nuclear physics, bright hard X-ray sources, and laboratory astrophysics. We report the experimental observation of plasmas with nanosecond-scale lifetimes, near-solid density, and keV-level temperatures, produced by irradiating periodic arrays of composite nanowires with ultra-high contrast, relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulses. Jet-like plasma structures extending up to 1~mm from the nanowire surface were observed, emitting K-shell radiation from He-like Ti$^{20+}$ ions. High-resolution X-ray spectra were analyzed using 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of the laser-plasma interaction combined with collisional--radiative modeling (FLYCHK). The results indicate that the jets consist of plasma with densities of $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and keV-scale temperatures, persisting for several nanoseconds. We attribute the formation of these jets to the generation of kiloTesla-scale global magnetic fields during the laser interaction, as predicted by PIC simulations. These fields may drive long-timescale current instabilities that sustain magnetic fields of several hundred tesla, sufficient to confine hot, dense plasma over nanosecond durations.</description>

      <title>Investigating Solid-Fluid Phase Coexistence in DC Plasma Bilayer Crystals: The Role of Particle Pairing and Mode Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a detailed investigation of solid-fluid phase coexistence in a bilayer dusty plasma crystal subjected to varying confinement ring bias voltages in a DC glow discharge argon plasma. Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged: it is characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and non-reciprocal interactions play a pivotal role in destabilizing the bilayer structure. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.</description>

      <title>Si3N4 membrane as entrance window for plasma-generated vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation produced by an atmospheric pressure plasma was successfully measured down to wavelengths of 58.4nm utilizing a 20nm thin Si3N4 membrane to transfer the VUV radiation into a vacuum monochromator. This method allows measurements without disturbing the plasma or the spectra. He2 absorption could be observed by filling the monochromator with He. Transmission of the Si3N4 membrane in the region of the He2 excimer continua (58nm to 100 nm) could indirectly be measured and confirms literature values.</description>

      <title>The impact of plasma turbulence on atomic reaction rates in detached divertors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical plasma models of the edge and scrape-off layer rely on reaction rates to describe key atomic processes such as ionization, recombination, charge-exchange, and line radiation. These rates depend non-linearly on local density and temperature, and are thus sensitive to turbulent fluctuations. We present an analysis of atomic rates and their dependence on turbulent fluctuations, obtained from GRILLIX edge turbulence simulations in detached divertor conditions. Ionization, recombination and radiation rates are evaluated in turbulent and corresponding mean-field states, and their differences are discussed. While the effect is minimal in attached conditions with low fluctuation amplitudes (&lt; 50% of the background), pronounced discrepancies emerge in detached conditions with high fluctuation amplitudes (&gt; 300% of the background). Local ionization and radiation rates obtained from turbulent inputs are up to a factor of ~2 lower than rates obtained from mean-field inputs. The rate reduction is the result of the particular anti-correlation of electron density and temperature in detached conditions. When factoring out correlations, the turbulent rate approximately recovers to the mean-field rate. When arranged to correlate positively, the turbulent ionization rate instead increases by a factor of ~3. Our results demonstrate that the common method of evaluating rates with mean-field plasma inputs can introduce systematic errors to particle and energy balances, particularly in detached conditions.</description>

      <title>GyroSwin: 5D Surrogates for Gyrokinetic Plasma Turbulence Simulations</title>

Abstract: Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable energy production. A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding plasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital for next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often employed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However, they omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena neglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent heat transport. GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D, (ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent 3D$\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and the distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation inspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely used reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy cascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three orders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows promising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for scalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Asymmetric Effect in the Response of Photoionization Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variability of quasar radiation provides a powerful probe of the photoionization response of ionized gas, which plays a central role in tracing cosmic evolution and plasma physics under extreme conditions. In this work, we investigate the physical origin of the asymmetric response observed in broad absorption line (BAL) systems and constrain the gas density and spatial scale of quasar outflows. Using time-dependent photoionization simulations and analytical estimates focused on CIV, we quantify the response timescales across different ionization states. Our results show that over 70\% of BAL gas exhibits a negative response to quasar dimming, indicating a strong asymmetry in ionization behavior. This asymmetry is driven by systematically shorter response timescales in higher ionization states. Given typical observational cadences longer than one day, the observed response pattern requires at least 40% of the BAL gas to have a density below $n_{\rm H} = 10^6\ \cc$, consistent with most measured BAL densities but significantly lower than typical accretion disk winds ($n_{\rm H} &gt; 10^8\ \cc$). These findings suggest that BAL outflows either undergo substantial density evolution as they propagate or originate from larger-scale regions such as the dusty torus. The asymmetric response thus provides new constraints on the physical structure and origin of quasar outflows.</description>

      <title>A Characteristic Signature of Magnetospheric Wave-Particle Interactions Found in the Turbulent E-region</title>

Abstract: Plasma waves in the magnetosphere scatter electrons, causing them to precipitate into Earth's atmosphere, imparting their temporal characteristics to diffuse auroras. In a case study of conjugate radar and satellite observations, we demonstrate a close and unprecedented association between enhanced electrostatic cyclotron harmonic wave activity in the magnetosphere and the appearance of meter-scale plasma turbulence a few seconds later in the lower ionosphere on nearby magnetic field lines. Such direct structuring of the ionosphere carries implications for our understanding of space weather.</description>

      <title>Memory- and compute-optimized geometric multigrid GMGPolar for curvilinear coordinate representations -- Applications to fusion plasma</title>

Abstract: Tokamak fusion reactors are actively studied as a means of realizing energy production from plasma fusion. However, due to the substantial cost and time required to construct fusion reactors and run physical experiments, numerical experiments are indispensable for understanding plasma physics inside tokamaks, supporting the design and engineering phase, and optimizing future reactor designs. Geometric multigrid methods are optimal solvers for many problems that arise from the discretization of partial differential equations. It has been shown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson equation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared to other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely refactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different matrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the Sherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line solvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache access of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach, memory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are obtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can be attained. In an additionally experimental setup of using GMGPolar as a preconditioner for conjugate gradients, this speedup could even be increased to factors between 25 and 37.</description>

      <title>Restarting the Numerical Flow Iteration through low rank tensor approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The numerical flow iteration method has recently been proposed as a memory-slim solution method for the Vlasov--Poisson system. It stores the temporal evolution of the electric field and reconstructs the solution in each time step by following the characteristics backwards in time and reconstructing the solution from the initial distribution. If the number of time steps gets large, the computational cost of this reconstruction may get prohibitive. Given a representation of the intermediate solution, the time intervals over which the characteristic curves need to be solved backwards in time can be reduced by restarting the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) after certain time intervals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs a low-rank representation of the solution at the restart times using a randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) algorithm with lazy evaluation. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity compared to the pure Numerical Flow Iteration from quadratic to linear in the number of times step while still keeping its memory complexity. On the other hand, our numerical results demonstrate that the methods preserves the property of the Numerical Flow Iteration of showing much less dissipation of filaments compared to the semi-Lagrangian method.</description>
