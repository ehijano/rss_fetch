      <title>Three dimensional He+ pickup ion velocity distribution functions observed with STEREO-A PLASTIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freshly injected interstellar Pickup Ions (PUIs) are expected to exhibit a simple, torus-shaped velocity distribution function. The PUI velocity in the solar wind frame depends on the velocity of the interstellar neutral (ISN) population at the pick-up position. In this study, we compare PUI velocity distributions measured by the PLasma And SupraThermal Ion Composition (PLASTIC) instrument over the full orbit of Solar TErestrial RElations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) directly. We define a new position-independent velocity measure for PUIs that takes the local direction of the interstellar neutral inflow into account. The resulting new PUI velocity measure corrects thereby for the position-dependent contribution of the ISN velocity. Pitch-angle distributions are then analysed depending on the magnetic-field azimuthal angle for different orbital positions and different values of the PUI velocity measure. The new PUI velocity measure shows an approximately constant cut-off over the complete orbit of STEREO-A. A torus signature is visible everywhere. Therein, a broadening of the torus signature outside the focusing cone and crescent regions and for lower velocity measure observed. In addition, we illustrate the symmetry between the primary and secondary ISN trajectory in the vicinity of the focusing cone. A torus signature associated with freshly injected PUIs is visible over the complete orbit of STEREO-A with increased density in the focusing cone. At least remnants of a torus signature remain for smaller values of the PUI velocity measure. The new velocity measure also prepares for PUI studies with Solar Orbiter.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning heat flux closure for multi-moment fluid modeling of nonlinear Landau damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear plasma physics problems are usually simulated through comprehensive modeling of phase space. The extreme computational cost of such simulations has motivated the development of multi-moment fluid models. However, a major challenge has been finding a suitable fluid closure for these fluid models. Recent developments in physics-informed machine learning have led to a renewed interest in constructing accurate fluid closure terms. In this study, we take an approach that integrates kinetic physics from the first-principles Vlasov simulations into a fluid model (through the heat flux closure term) using the Fourier neural operator - a neural network architecture. Without resolving the phase space dynamics, this new fluid model is capable of capturing the nonlinear evolution of the Landau damping process that exactly matches the Vlasov simulation results. This machine learning-assisted new approach provides a computationally affordable framework that surpasses previous fluid models in accurately modeling the kinetic evolution of complex plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Data-constrained 3D MHD Simulation of a Spiral Jet Caused by an Unstable Flux Rope Embedded in Fan-spine Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral jets are impulsive plasma ejections that typically show an apparent rotation motion. Their generation, however, is still nont understood thoroughly. Based on a high-resolution vector magnetogram form the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager onboard Solar Orbiter, we constrcut a data-constrained three-dimensional (3D) MHD model, aiming to disclose the eruption mechanism of a tiny spiral jet at a moss region observed on March 3 2022. The initial configuration of the simulation consists of an extrapolated coronal magnetic field based on the vector magnetogram and an inserted unstable flux rope constructed by the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws method. Our results highlight the critical role of the fan-spine configuration in forming the spiral jet and confirm the collapse of the pre-existing magnetic null to a curved 3D current sheet where external reconnection takes places. It is further disclosed that the flux rope quickly moves upward, reconnecting with the field lines near the outer spine, thereby enabling the transfer of twist and cool material from the flux rope to the open field, giving rise to the tiny spiral jet we observed. The notable similarities between these characteristics and those for larger-scale jets suggest that spiral jets, regardless of their scale, essentially share the same eruption mechanism.</description>

      <title>Electron Heating by Parallel Electric Fields in Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate electron heating by magnetic-field-aligned electric fields ($E_\parallel$) during anti-parallel magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail. Using a statistical sample of 140 reconnection outflows, we infer the acceleration potential associated with $E_\parallel$ from the shape of the electron velocity distribution functions. We show that heating by $E_\parallel$ in the reconnection outflow can reach up to ten times the inflow electron temperature. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the acceleration potential scales with the inflow Alfv\'en and electron thermal speeds to maintain quasi-neutrality in the reconnection region. Our results suggest that, as the inflow plasma parameter $\beta_{e\infty}$ increases, $E_\parallel$ becomes increasingly important to the ion-to-electron energy partition associated with magnetic reconnection.</description>
