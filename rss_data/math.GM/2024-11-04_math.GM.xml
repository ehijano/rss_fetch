      <title>Some Diophantine Equations involving associated Pell numbers and repdigits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between repdigits and associated Pell numbers, specifically focusing on two main aspects: expressing repdigits as the difference of two associated Pell numbers, and identifying which associated Pell numbers can be represented as the difference of two repdigits. Additionally, we investigate all associated Pell numbers which are concatenation of three repdigits. Our proof utilizes Baker's theory on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers, along with the Baker-Davenport reduction technique. The computations were carried out with the help of a simple computer program in {\it Mathematica}.</description>

      <title>Graham's number stable digits: an exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the decimal numeral system, we prove that the well-known Graham's number, $G := \! ^{n}3$ (i.e., $3^{3^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{3}}}}} n$-times), and any base $3$ tetration whose hyperexponent is larger than $n$ share the same $slog_3(G) - 1$ rightmost digits (where $slog$ indicates the integer super-logarithm). This is an exact result since the $slog_3(G)$-th rightmost digit of $G$ is different from the $slog_3(G)$-th rightmost digit of $^{n+1}3$. Furthermore, we show that the $slog_3(^{n}3)$-th least significant digit of the difference between Graham's number and any base $3$ tetration whose integer hyperexponent is beyond $n$ is $4$.</description>

      <title>Applying numerosity to surreal integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of numerosity, a measure of a set's size, more precise than cardinality and satisfying the Euclid's principle "the whole is greater than a part" as a surreal number and provide an explicit formula for expressing numerosities of some sequences that have no accumiulation points as surreal expressions, with examples. Then we introduce a surreal-valued function that shares many properties with Dirac Delta distribution and employ it to derive some integration properties of surrreal values. Finally, we provide a formula for integrating a surreal-valued function over surreal domain, employing numerosity in a way, similar to Lebesgue measure and derive some novel formulas, connecting surreal numbers via integration. The suggested here method of surreal integration is different from methods suggested by other authors in not satisfying the property of linearity regarding infinite factors. In our opinion, the struggle to keep this rule intact is the reason for many failed attempts to define the surreal integration. For the suggested formulas, code in Wolfram Mathematica language is provided.</description>

      <title>On the cyclic 3-manifold covers of the type surface x R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article contains a proof of the fact that, under certain mild technical conditions, the action of the automorphism group of a cyclic 3-manifold cover of the type SxR, where S is a compact surface, yields a compact quotient. This result is then immediately applied to extend a theorem on the fiberings over the circle of certain compact 3-manifolds which are torus sums. As a corollary, I prove the validity of the conditional main theorem in my article titled "A fibering theorem for 3-manifolds", which appeared in the Journal of Groups, Complexity, Cryptology in 2021 and its subsequent erratum. This paper also furnishes a proof of the irreducibility of the summands of compact 3-manifolds which are torus sums and irreducible, and a proof of the interesting observation that a compact connected orientable 3-manifold whose fundamental group contains a subnormal subgroup of infinite index is the connected sum of an irreducible compact 3-manifold with (finitely many) 3-balls.</description>
