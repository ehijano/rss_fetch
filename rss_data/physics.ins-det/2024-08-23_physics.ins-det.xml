      <title>Dual-readout calorimetry with homogeneous crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High resolution calorimetry with state-of-the-art energy resolution performance for both electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic signals can be achieved using the dual-readout (DR) technique, both in a homogeneous scintillating-crystal calorimeter and in a traditional fiber and absorber-based DR hadronic section. We present results from the CalVision consortium studying the collection of Cerenkov and scintillation signals in PbWO$_4$ and BGO crystal samples exposed to 120\,GeV proton beams at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility, including proof-of-principle measurements aimed at demonstrating the identification of a sufficiently large Cerenkov signal in homogeneous scintillating crystals to support dual-readout capability.</description>

      <title>Laboratory x-ray nano-computed tomography for biomedical research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution x-ray tomography is a common technique for biomedical research using synchrotron sources. With advancements in laboratory x-ray sources, an increasing number of experiments can be performed in the lab. In this paper, the design, implementation, and verification of a laboratory setup for x-ray nano-computed tomography is presented using a nano-focus x-ray source and high geometric magnification not requiring any optical elements. Comparing a scintillator-based detector to a photon counting detector shows a clear benefit of using photon counting detectors for these applications, where the flux of the x-ray source is limited and samples have low contrast. Sample contrast is enhanced using propagation-based phase contrast. The resolution of the system is verified using 2D resolution charts and using Fourier Ring Correlation on reconstructed CT slices. Evaluating noise and contrast highlights the benefits of photon counting detectors and the contrast improvement through phase contrast. The implemented setup is capable of reaching sub-micron resolution and satisfying contrast in biological samples, like paraffin embedded tissue.</description>

      <title>Measurements of proton hardness factors in silicon at energies between 10 MeV and 25 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon detector technologies are often employed for high energy particle physics applications due to their excellent radiation hardness. Radiation damage in the form of bulk or substrate damage is dependent on the incident particle species and energy. The fluence is therefore often quoted as the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence, with hardness factors being the scaling quantity. The hardness factor can be determined by analysing the change in the leakage current of silicon pad diodes post-irradiation. Using the MC40 cyclotron facility at the University of Birmingham, n-in-p FZ silicon pad diodes were irradiated to several fluence points at three different proton beam energies. The hardness factors acquired were 3.07 $\pm$ 0.37 for 10.5 MeV protons, 2.73 $\pm$ 0.27 for 16.4 MeV protons and 2.19 $\pm$ 0.22 for 24.3 MeV protons. The value for 16.4 MeV protons agrees with the theoretical predictions, whereas the values for 10.5 MeV and 24.3 MeV are lower than predicted by the same calculations.</description>

      <title>Integrating high-precision and fringe-scale displacement sensing using heterodyne cavity-tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a heterodyne stabilized cavity-based interferometer scheme that can serve as a compact and high-sensitivity displacement sensor with a fringe-scale operating range. The technique, in principle, can reach a sub-femtometer noise floor and an operating range on the order of one laser wavelength at $\lambda \approx 1\,\mu m$. With our current experimental setup, we achieve a sensitivity of about $130 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $1\,Hz$ and $23 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at around $130\,Hz$. By probing a length actuated cavity, we demonstrate six orders of magnitude of dynamic range for displacement measurement, reaching a maximum motion of $0.15\,\mu m$. The tracking bandwidth and displacement range are limited by analog effects in the signal digitization and are extendable in the future.</description>

      <title>$\tau$SPECT: A spin-flip loaded magnetic ultracold neutron trap for a determination of the neutron lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The confinement of ultracold neutrons (UCNs) in a three dimensional magnetic field gradient trap allows for a measurement of the free neutron lifetime with superior control over spurious loss channels and can provide a large kinetic energy acceptance to enhance statistical sensitivity. In this paper, we present the first successful implementation of a pulsed spin-flip based loading scheme for a three-dimensional magnetic UCN trap. The measurements with the $\tau$SPECT experiment were performed at the pulsed UCN source of the research reactor TRIGA Mainz. We report on detailed investigations of major systematic effects influencing the neutron storage time, statistically limited by the size of the recorded data set. The extracted neutron storage time constant of $\tau = 859(16)\mathrm{s}$ is compatible with, but not to be interpreted as, a measurement of the free neutron lifetime.</description>

      <title>Characterization of SiPM Performance in a Small Satellite in Low Earth Orbit using LabOSat-01</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the performance of SensL MicroFC-60035 SiPM devices was studied during a 1460-day mission in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using the LabOSat-01 characterization payload. Two of these platforms, carrying two SiPMs each, were integrated into the \~NuSat-7 satellite (COSPAR-ID: 2020-003B). Analysis revealed that these SiPMs experienced an increase in dark current over time due to damage from trapped and solar proton radiation. The total ionizing dose received by the payload and the SiPMs was measured using p-MOSFET dosimeters, with a resulting value of 5 Gy, or a 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence of $\phi_n = 5 \cdot 10^9$ n/cm$^2$. The dark current was observed to increase up to 500 times. Parameters such as Gain and Photon Detection Efficiency remained unchanged throughout the mission. These findings align with previous performance reports involving different SiPMs irradiated with various particles and energies.</description>

      <title>Phase-Based Approaches for Rapid Construction of Magnetic Fields in NV Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the second quantum revolution underway, quantum-enhanced sensors are moving from laboratory demonstrations to field deployments, providing enhanced and even new capabilities. Signal processing and operational software is becoming integral parts of these emerging sensing systems to reap the benefits of this progress. This paper looks into widefield Nitrogen Vacancy Center-based magnetometry and focuses on estimating the magnetic field from the Optically Detected Magnetic Resonances (ODMR) signal, a crucial output for various applications. Mapping the shifts of ODMR signals to phase estimation, a computationally efficient approaches are proposed. Involving Fourier Transform and Filtering as pre-processing steps, the suggested approaches involve linear curve fit or complex frequency estimation based on well-known super-resolution technique Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). The existing methods in the quantum sensing literature take different routes based on Lorentzian fitting for determining magnetic field maps. To showcase the functionality and effectiveness of the suggested techniques, relevant results, based on experimental data are provided, which shows a significant reduction in computational time with the proposed method over existing methods</description>
