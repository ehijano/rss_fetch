      <title>A Universal Scaling Law for $T_c$ in Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductors remains a core challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly the ongoing debate over whether the related effects caused by electron-electron interactions unify various unconventional superconductors (UcSs). To address this challenge, it is necessary to establish a universal quantitative relationship for the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$), which can be directly obtained from experiments and correlated with microscopic parameters of different material systems. In this work, we establish a relation: $N_{\text{CP}}\cdot k_{B}T_{c}^\star = \alpha\cdot U $, where $\alpha = 1/(16\pi)$ is a universal constant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{c}^\star$ is the maximal $T_{c}$, $U$ is the on-site Coulomb interaction, and $N_{\text{CP}}$($\propto(\xi_0/a)^D$) quantifies the spatial extent of Cooper pairs ($\xi_0$) relative to lattice parameter ($a$) in $D$ dimensions. The validity of this scaling relationship is empirically demonstrated, across a four order-of-magnitude $T_c^\star$ range (0.08--133 K), by database from 173 different compounds spanning 13 different UcS families in over 500 experiments. The fact that the unified relationship is satisfied by different materials of different UcS families reveals that they may share superconducting mechanisms. In addition, the scaling relationship indicates the existence of a maximum $T_{c}^\star$ determined by the minimum $N_{\text{CP}}$, providing a benchmark for theoretical and experimental exploration of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Contactless cavity sensing of superfluid stiffness in atomically thin 4Hb-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional tunability of two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers unique opportunities for exploring novel superconducting phases. However, in such systems, the measurement of superfluid phase stiffness, a fundamental property of a superconductor, is challenging because of the mesoscopic sample size. Here, we introduce a contact-free technique for probing the electrodynamic response, and thereby the phase stiffness, of atomically thin superconductors using on-chip superconducting microwave resonators. We demonstrate this technique on 4Hb-TaS$_2$, a van der Waals superconductor whose gap structure under broken mirror symmetry is under debate. In our cleanest few-layer device, we observe a superconducting critical temperature comparable to that of the bulk. The temperature evolution of the phase stiffness features nodeless behavior in the presence of broken mirror symmetry, inconsistent with the scenario of nodal surface superconductivity. With minimal fabrication requirements, our technique enables microwave measurements across wide ranges of two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Low-Gap Hf-HfOx-Hf Josephson Junctions for meV-Scale Particle Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies.</description>

      <title>Spatially Inhomogeneous Triplet Pairing Order and Josephson Diode Effect Induced by Frustrated Spin Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that frustrated spin textures can generate anisotropic Josephson couplings between $d$-vectors that can stabilize spatially varying pairing orders in spin triplet superconductors. These couplings depend on the relative orientation of $d$-vectors, analogous to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and $\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism, leading to an effective "pliability" of the pairing order that competes with superfluid stiffness. Such couplings cannot originate from spin-orbit coupling; rather, they can arise, for example, when itinerant electrons are coupled to a local exchange field composed of frustrated spin moments. Using a $T$-matrix expansion, we show that coupling to a local exchange field leads to an effective tunneling of itinerant electrons that is dependent on the underlying spin configurations at the barrier between superconducting grains. Furthermore, Josephson tunneling through frustrated spin textures can produce a Josephson diode effect. The diode effect originates either from nonvanishing spin chirality in the barrier, or from antisymmetric Josephson coupling between noncollinear $d$-vectors, both of which break inversion and time-reversal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the "essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of "ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Artificial Transmission Line Synthesis Tailored for Traveling-Wave Parametric Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial transmission lines built with lumped-element inductors and capacitors form the backbone of broadband, nearly quantum-limited traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs). However, systematic design methods for TWPAs, and more generally artificial transmission lines, are lacking. Here, I develop a general synthesis framework for lossless artificial transmission lines by borrowing from periodic structure theory and passive network synthesis. These complementary approaches divide the design space: periodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent components, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in spatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric processes, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in superconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation between interacting tones. Applying this framework, I design a kinetic inductance TWPA with a novel phase-matching architecture, and a backward-pumped Josephson TWPA exploiting an ambidextrous i.e., right-left-handed transmission line.</description>

      <title>Pairing-induced phase transition in the non-reciprocal Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the robustness of non-reciprocity in the presence of competing interactions is central to understanding non-reciprocal quantum matter. In this work, we use reservoir engineering to induce non-reciprocal hopping and pairing in the fermionic Kitaev chain, and reveal the emergence of a pairing-induced phase transition. The two phases appear in the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Kitaev Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of correlations, separated by an exceptional point. In the non-reciprocal phase, dynamics are characterized by directionality and slow relaxation, and the steady state supports non-reciprocal density and spatial correlations. At strong pairing, we uncover an unexpected density wave phase, featuring short relaxation times, a modulation in particle occupation and strikingly different correlation spreading depending on pairing non-reciprocity. Our work highlights the non-trivial breakdown of non-reciprocity due to superconducting pairing and invites experimental investigation of non-reciprocal fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Study of the Hubbard Model via Enhanced Exponential Tensor Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model has long attracted interest for its rich phase diagram and its relevance to high-$T_c$ superconductivity. However, reliable finite-temperature studies remain challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body interactions. Here, we introduce an enhanced $1\text{s}^+$ eXponential Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm that enables efficient finite-temperature simulations of the 2D Hubbard model. By exploring an expanded space, our approach achieves two-site update accuracy at the computational cost of a one-site update, and delivers up to 50% acceleration for Hubbard-like systems, which enables simulations down to $T\!\approx\!0.004t$. This advance permits a direct investigation of superconducting order over a wide temperature range and facilitates a comparison with zero-temperature infinite Projected Entangled Pair State simulations. Finally, we compile a comprehensive dataset of snapshots spanning the relevant region of the phase diagram, providing a valuable reference for Artificial Intelligence-driven analyses of the Hubbard model and a comparison with cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in KTaO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: KTaO$_3$ (KTO) is an incipient ferroelectric, characterized by a softening of the lowest transverse optical (TO) mode with decreasing temperature. Cooper pairing in the recently discovered KTO-based heterostructures has been proposed to be mediated by the soft TO mode. Here we study the electron coupling to the zone-center odd-parity modes of bulk KTO by means of relativistic Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT). The coupling to the soft TO mode is by far the largest, with comparable contributions from both intraband and interband processes. Remarkably, we find that for this mode, spin-non-conserving matrix elements are particularly relevant. We develop a three-band microscopic model with spin-orbit coupled $t_{2g}$ orbitals that reproduces the main features of the ab initio results. For the highest energy band, the coupling can be understood as a "dynamical" isotropic Rashba effect. In contrast, for the two lowest bands, the Rashba-like coupling becomes strongly anisotropic. The DFPT protocol implemented here enables the calculation of the full electron-phonon coupling matrix projected onto any mode of interest, and it is easily applicable to other systems.</description>

      <title>N\'eel proximity effect at antiferromagnet/superconductor interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-splitting induced in a conventional superconductor weakens superconductivity by destroying spin-singlet and creating spin-triplet Cooper pairs. We demonstrate theoretically that such an effect is also caused by an adjacent compensated antiferromagnet, which yields no net spin-splitting. We find that the antiferromagnet produces N\'eel triplet Cooper pairs, whose pairing amplitude oscillates rapidly in space similar to the antiferromagnet's spin. The emergence of these unconventional Cooper pairs reduces the singlet pairs' amplitude, thereby lowering the superconducting critical temperature. We develop a quasiclassical Green's functions description of the system employing a two-sublattice framework. It successfully captures the rapid oscillations in the Cooper pairs' amplitude at the lattice spacing scale as well as their smooth variation on the larger coherence length scale. Employing the theoretical framework thus developed, we investigate this N\'eel proximity effect in a superconductor/antiferromagnet bilayer as a function of interfacial exchange, disorder, and chemical potential, finding rich physics. Our findings also offer insights into experiments which have found a larger than expected suppression of superconductivity by an adjacent antiferromagnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andreev bound states can occur at single impurities in superconductors if the impurities suppress superconductivity for a given system. In particular, well-known Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states occur at magnetic impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors. Here we demonstrate that nonmagnetic impurities in S/AF heterostructures with conventional intraband s-wave pairing also produce Andreev bound states. Analogously to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states the bound states in S/AF bilayers are spin split, but the spin of a particular bound state is determined by the sublattice to which the impurity belongs. The standard decay of the bound state LDOS is superimposed by atomic oscillations related to the staggered character of the exchange field in the host material and by another oscillating pattern produced by finite-momentum Neel triplet pairing generated at the impurity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, which allow for fine tuning of the effective magnetic interaction between the impurity and the superconductor, we investigate the regime around the quantum phase transition where the system's ground state changes from a weakly coupled free spin to a screened spin regime. At this transition we find that the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states remain at finite energies at low temperatures, thereby generating a gap in the spectrum, which is inconsistent with predictions of the original YSR theory. We investigate various gap-generating scenarios and determine that the local suppression of the order parameter, only captured by self-consistent calculations, generates the gap.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-Liquid Transport Phenomena in Infinite-Layer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$=Nd, La, Pr) attract increasing attention due to their similarities to cuprates. Both $R$NiO$_2$ and YBCO cuprates exhibit the non-Fermi-liquid transport behavior, characterized by resistivity proportional to temperature near the quantum critical point of the charge or spin density wave. In this study, we analyze the resistivity of infinite-layer nickelate Nd$_{0.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$NiO$_2$ based on a three-dimensional tight-binding model within the framework of the quasi-particle picture by applying linear response theory. We take account of the self-energy by the fluctuation-exchange approximation for the Ni orbital and the T-matrix approximation for an impurity effect on the Nd orbitals. We find that (i) the $T$-linear resistivity at low temperatures is derived from the spin fluctuations, and (ii) a negative and $T$-linear Seebeck coefficient is obtained. Therefore, NdNiO$_2$ behaves as a quasi-two-dimensional electron system, similar to CeCoIn$_5$.</description>
