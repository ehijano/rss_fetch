      <title>Sustainability &amp; Social Segmentation in Social Media Contagion: A Mathematical and Computational Study on Dual Effects of Individual Needs &amp; Peer Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addiction to internet-based social media has increasingly emerged as a critical social problem, especially among young adults and teenagers. Based on multiple research studies, excessive usage of social media may have detrimental psychological and physical impacts. In this study, we are going to explore mathematically the dynamics of social media addiction behaviour and explore the determinants of compulsive use of social media from the dual perspectives of individual needs or cravings and peer-related factors or peer pressure. The theoretical analysis of the model without the peer pressure effect reveals that the associated addiction-free equilibrium is globally stable whenever a certain threshold, known as the addictive-generation number, is less than unity and unstable when the threshold is greater than unity. We observed how introduction of peer influence adds a sustainability to the dynamics, and causes a multistability, through which addiction-contagion can proliferate, even below the designated critical threshold. Using simulations over model networks, we demonstrate our finding, even in the presence of social heterogeneity. Finally, we use the reaction-diffusion approach to investigate spatio-temporal dynamics in a synthetic society, in the form of a 2D lattice. Instead of a fast convergence to the steady states, we observe a long transient of social clustering and segmentation, represented by spatio-temporal pattern formation. Our model illustrates how the peer influence factor plays a crucial role and concludes that it is required to consider the peer factors while formulating specific strategies that could be more effective against this addiction and its potential adverse outcomes.</description>

      <title>Descriptions of women are longer than that of men: An analysis of gender portrayal prompts in Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI for image creation emerges as a staple in the toolkit of digital artists, visual designers, and the general public. Social media users have many tools to shape their visual representation: image editing tools, filters, face masks, face swaps, avatars, and AI-generated images. The importance of the right profile image can not be understated: It is crucial for creating the right first impression, sustains trust, and enables communication. Conventionally correct representation of individuals, groups, and collectives may help foster inclusivity, understanding, and respect in society, ensuring that diverse perspectives are acknowledged and valued. While previous research revealed the biases in large image datasets such as ImageNet and inherited biases in the AI systems trained on it, within this work, we look at the prejudices and stereotypes as they emerge from textual prompts used for generating images on Discord using the StableDiffusion model. We analyze over 1.8 million prompts depicting men and women and use statistical methods to uncover how prompts describing men and women are constructed and what words constitute the portrayals of respective genders. We show that the median male description length is systematically shorter than the median female description length, while our findings also suggest a shared practice of prompting regarding the word length distribution. The topic analysis suggests the existence of classic stereotypes in which men are described using dominant qualities such as "strong" and "rugged". In contrast, women are represented with concepts related to body and submission: "beautiful", "pretty", etc. These results highlight the importance of the original intent of the prompting and suggest that cultural practices on platforms such as Discord should be considered when designing interfaces that promote exploration and fair representation.</description>

      <title>Beautimeter: Harnessing GPT for Assessing Architectural and Urban Beauty based on the 15 Properties of Living Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beautimeter is a new tool powered by generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology, designed to evaluate architectural and urban beauty. Rooted in Christopher Alexander's theory of centers, this work builds on the idea that all environments possess, to varying degrees, an innate sense of life. Alexander identified 15 fundamental properties, such as levels of scale and thick boundaries, that characterize living structure, which Beautimeter uses as a basis for its analysis. By integrating GPT's advanced natural language processing capabilities, Beautimeter assesses the extent to which a structure embodies these 15 properties, enabling a nuanced evaluation of architectural and urban aesthetics. Using ChatGPT, the tool helps users generate insights into the perceived beauty and coherence of spaces. We conducted a series of case studies, evaluating images of architectural and urban environments, as well as carpets, paintings, and other artifacts. The results demonstrate Beautimeter's effectiveness in analyzing aesthetic qualities across diverse contexts. Our findings suggest that by leveraging GPT technology, Beautimeter offers architects, urban planners, and designers a powerful tool to create spaces that resonate deeply with people. This paper also explores the implications of such technology for architecture and urban design, highlighting its potential to enhance both the design process and the assessment of built environments.

      <title>The Co-evolution of Cooperation and Epidemic Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People's cooperation in adopting protective measures is effective in epidemic control and creates herd immunity as a public good. Similarly, the presence of an epidemic is a driving factor for the formation and improvement of cooperation. Here, we study the coevolution of epidemic dynamics and the public good game as a paradigm of cooperation dynamics. Using simulations and a mean-field description, we show that the presence of an epidemic can promote cooperation even in regimes where cooperation would not naturally emerge in the standard public good game. The coupling of the two dynamics leads to a rich phenomenology, such as the more efficient control of epidemics, instead of higher cooperation, when the economic benefit of cooperation increases, or higher cooperation, but not higher disease spread, when disease transmission probability increases. Besides, our work shows that a higher altruistic effect of cooperation in controlling the disease can only be detrimental to the evolution of cooperation and disease control. Rather, individuals' choices in adopting costly preventive measures are predominantly driven by the self-interested effect of such measures in reducing the probability of getting infected.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Transformative Power of Deliberation With Contextual Citizens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate deliberation procedures that invite citizens with contextual opinions to explore alternative thinking frames. Contextuality is captured in a simple quantum cognitive model. We show how disagreeing citizens endowed with contextual opinions, can reach consensus in a binary collective decision problem with no improvement in their information. A necessary condition is that they are willing to (mentally) experience their fellow citizens' way of thinking. The diversity of thinking frames is what makes it possible to overcome initial disagreement. Consensus does not emerge spontaneously from deliberations: it requires facilitation.</description>

      <title>Collective decision-making with heterogeneous biases: Role of network topology and susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of groups to make accurate collective decisions depends on a complex interplay of various factors, such as prior information, biases, social influence, and the structure of the interaction network. Here, we investigate a spin model that accounts for heterogeneous preferences and enables control over the non-linearity of social interactions. Building on previous results for complete graphs and regular 2D lattices, we investigate how the modification of network topology towards (sparse) random graphs can affect collective decision-making. We use two different measures of susceptibility to assess the responsiveness of the system to internal and external perturbations. In particular, we investigate how the maximum of susceptibility depends on network connectivity. Based on our findings, we discuss how collective systems might adapt to changes in environmental fluctuations by adjusting their network structure or the nature of their social interactions in order to remain in the region of maximal susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in the Simplicial Ising Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase transitions in the simplicial Ising model on hypergraphs, in which the energy within each hyperedge (group) is lowered only when all the member spins are unanimously aligned. The Hamiltonian of the model is equivalent to a weighted sum of lower-order interactions, evoking an Ising model defined on a simplicial complex. Using the Landau free energy approach within the mean-field theory, we identify diverse phase transitions depending on the sizes of hyperedges. Specifically, when all hyperedges have the same size $q$, the nature of the transitions shifts from continuous to discontinuous at the tricritical point $q=4$, with the transition temperatures varying nonmonotonically, revealing the ambivalent effects of group size $q$. Furthermore, if both pairwise edges and hyperedges of size $q&gt;2$ coexist in a hypergraph, novel scenarios emerge, including mixed-order and double transitions, particularly for $q&gt;8$. Adopting the Bethe--Peierls method, we investigate the interplay between pairwise and higher-order interactions in achieving global magnetization, illuminating the multiscale nature of the higher-order dynamics.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Ising model on hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-dyadic higher-order interactions affect collective behavior in various networked dynamical systems. Here we discuss the properties of a novel Ising model with higher-order interactions and characterize its phase transitions between the ordered and the disordered phase. By a mean-field treatment, we show that the transition is continuous when only three-body interactions are considered but becomes abrupt when interactions of higher orders are introduced. Using a Georges-Yedidia expansion to go beyond a na\"ive mean-field approximation, we reveal a quantitative shift in the critical point of the phase transition, which does not affect the universality class of the model. Finally, we compare our results with traditional $p$-spin models with many-body interactions. Our work unveils new collective phenomena on complex interacting systems, revealing the importance of investigating higher-order systems beyond three-body interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between network features and misinformation propagation is crucial for mitigating the spread of false information. Here, we investigate how network density and segregation affect the dissemination of misinformation using a susceptible-infectious-recovered framework. We find that a higher density consistently increases the proportion of misinformation believers. In segregated networks, our results reveal that minorities affect the majority: denser minority groups increase the number of believers in the majority, demonstrating how the structure of a segregated minority can influence misinformation dynamics within the majority group.</description>

      <title>Traffic Response Functions: Patterns, Propagation and Congestion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We further pursue a recently tested approach to the study of transport systems. Using empirical data collected on German motorways, we investigate the use of response functions as a tool to study traffic dynamics in motorway networks. We use a response function that measures the change in traffic observed at a given location over time conditioned on congestion at another location. By introducing several velocity-dependent congestion indicators, we are able to work out the basic characteristics of the flow and density responses to congestion. Our results demonstrate that these responses capture the propagation of congestion, the acceleration phases of traffic participants during congestion, and the correlation between the three fundamental traffic observables: flow, density, and velocity. Furthermore, a direct comparison with the underlying data reveals the potential for characterizing traffic patterns with response functions. A relationship between the shape of the response functions and the traffic oscillation during a traffic jam can be demonstrated. Moreover, our findings allow us to determine the propagation velocity of congestion from responses. Importantly, in the course of our analysis, we also identify a scaling property that results in the collapse of the response functions onto a single curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavioral adoptions are influenced by peers in different ways. While some individuals may change after a single incoming influence, others need multiple cumulated attempts. These two mechanism, known as the simple and the complex contagions, often occur together in social phenomena alongside personal factors determining individual adoptions. Here we aim to identify which of these contagion mechanism dominate a spreading process propagated by time-varying interactions. We consider three types of spreading scenarios: ones pre-dominated by simple or complex contagion, and mixed dynamics where the dominant mechanism changes during the unfolding of the spreading process. We propose different methods to analytically identify the transitions between these three scenarios and compare them with numerical simulations. This work offers new insights into social contagion dynamics on temporal networks, without assuming prior knowledge about individual's contagion mechanism driving their adoption decisions.</description>

      <title>Geographic Space as Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The communications and interrelations between different locations on the Earth's surface have far-reaching implications for both social and natural systems. Effective spatial analytics ideally require a spatial representation, where geographic principles are succinctly expressed within a defined metric space. However, common spatial representations, including map-based or network-based approaches, fall short by incompletely or inaccurately defining this metric space. Here we show, by introducing an inverse friction factor that captures the spatial constraints in spatial networks, that a homogeneous, low-dimensional spatial representation - termed the Geographic Manifold - can be achieved. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Geographic Manifold in two classic scenarios of spatial analytics - location choice and propagation, where the otherwise complicated analyses are reduced to straightforward regular partitioning and concentric diffusing, respectively on the manifold with a high degree of accuracy. We further empirically explain and formally prove the general existence of the Geographic Manifold, which is grounded in the intrinsic Euclidean low-dimensional statistical physics properties of geographic phenomena. This work represents a step towards formalizing Tobler's famous First Law of Geography from a geometric approach, where a regularized geospace thereby yielded is expected to contribute in learning abstract spatial structure representations for understanding and optimization purposes.</description>

      <title>Modelling plausible scenarios for the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant from early-stage surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We used a spatially explicit agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission combined with spatially fine-grained COVID-19 observation data from Public Health Scotland to investigate the initial rise of the Omicron (BA.1) variant of concern. We evaluated plausible scenarios for transmission rate advantage and vaccine immune escape relative to the Delta variant based on the data that would have been available at that time. We also explored possible outcomes of different levels of imposed non-pharmaceutical intervention. The initial results of these scenarios were used to inform the Scottish Government in the early outbreak stages of the Omicron variant.
  Using the model with parameters fit over the Delta variant epidemic, some initial assumptions about Omicron transmission rate advantage and vaccine escape, and a simple growth rate fitting procedure, we were able to capture the initial outbreak dynamics for Omicron. We found that the modelled dynamics hold up to retrospective scrutiny. The modelled imposition of extra non-pharmaceutical interventions planned by the Scottish Government at the time would likely have little effect in light of the transmission rate advantage held by the Omicron variant and the fact that the planned interventions would have occurred too late in the outbreak's trajectory. Finally, we found that any assumptions made about the projected distribution of vaccines in the model population had little bearing on the outcome, in terms of outbreak size and timing. Instead, it was the landscape of prior immunity that was most important.</description>

      <title>Rational Silence and False Polarization: How Viewpoint Organizations and Recommender Systems Distort the Expression of Public Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-based social media platforms has already transformed the nature of economic and social interaction. AI enables the massive scale and highly personalized nature of online information sharing that we now take for granted. Extensive attention has been devoted to the polarization that social media platforms appear to facilitate. However, a key implication of the transformation we are experiencing due to these AI-powered platforms has received much less attention: how platforms impact what observers of online discourse come to believe about community views. These observers include policymakers and legislators, who look to social media to gauge the prospects for policy and legislative change, as well as developers of AI models trained on large-scale internet data, whose outputs may similarly reflect a distorted view of public opinion. In this paper, we present a nested game-theoretic model to show how observed online opinion is produced by the interaction of the decisions made by users about whether and with what rhetorical intensity to share their opinions on a platform, the efforts of organizations (such as traditional media and advocacy organizations) that seek to encourage or discourage opinion-sharing online, and the operation of AI-powered recommender systems controlled by social media platforms. We show that signals from ideological organizations encourage an increase in rhetorical intensity, leading to the 'rational silence' of moderate users. This, in turn, creates a polarized impression of where average opinions lie. We also show that this observed polarization can also be amplified by recommender systems that encourage the formation of communities online that end up seeing a skewed sample of opinion. We also identify practical strategies platforms can implement, such as reducing exposure to signals from ideological organizations and a tailored approach to content moderation.</description>

Abstract: In the past several years, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) has suffered a number of troublesome setbacks. In some cases, failures to respond effectively have only made things worse, resulting in the current crisis atmosphere at the laboratory. This is reflected in part in the poorly rated performance appraisals (or PEMP) that the DOE provides to the lab every year. Three entities are currently responsible for supporting, managing, operating, and leading the lab: the Department of Energy (DOE), Fermi Research Alliance (FRA), and the Laboratory Director Office. Two recent events provide opportunities for interested parties to reverse the recent decline: the release in December 2023 of the P5 Report and the DOE decision to rebid the Management &amp; Operating (M&amp;O) contract. The P5 Report a decadal update of recommendations for US particle physics, includes an ambitious and positive roadmap for projects and activities at Fermilab. Carrying out the P5 plan successfully, however, will also require addressing many of the other problems currently besetting the lab. The selection of a new M&amp;O contractor is under the responsibility of the Deputy Director for Operations of the DOE Office of Science Dr. Juston Fontaine. A new M&amp;O Contractor would replace FRA and name a new Director effective January 1, 2025. A new management team, one hopes, would be motivated to solve problems and would enjoy a honeymoon period, enabling them to make positive changes more easily. Stimulated by these recent developments, the authors of this document, all present or past employees, convened confidentially in order to collect testimonials on a series of events symptomatic of the lab problems, to provide constructive criticism and offer possible solutions. This document summarizes this work.</description>
