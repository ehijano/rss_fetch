      <title>Controlling Impact Noise Propagation With Ceramic Metatiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the application of metamaterials for impact noise insulation in tiled floors. A ceramic metatile is developed which makes use of phononic metamaterials and optimized joint configurations. First, we optimize the geometrical and material parameters of the proposed metatile, which is composed of small ceramic tiles connected by silicon joints, in order to reduce longitudinal and flexural wave propagation on tiled floors. A bandgap is achieved that effectively mitigates the transmission of impact noise through periodic structural pathways. In both experimental and numerical tests, it is demonstrated that the integration of silicon joints inside the ceramic metatile improves the acoustic insulation performance, as measured by the reduction of impact noise levels across a wide range of low frequencies. The findings highlight the potential of metamaterials in architectural acoustics, offering innovative solutions for sound control in tiled environments.</description>

      <title>Multiple Ultrasound Image Generation based on Tuned Alignment of Amplitude Hologram over Spatially non-Uniform Ultrasound Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a method for readily and inexpensively generating real-time reconfigurable intense midair ultrasound field is proposed. Recent investigations and applications of midair convergent high-power ultrasound have been increasingly growing. For generating such ultrasound fields, specifically designed ultrasound sources or phased arrays of ultrasound transducers are conventionally used. The former can be more readily fabricated but cannot drastically reconfigure the generated ultrasound field, and the latter can create electronically controllable ultrasound fields but is much more difficult to implement and expensive. The proposed method utilizes a planar ultrasound source with a fixed surface vibration pattern and a newly designed amplitude mask inspired by the Fresnel-zone-plate (FZP). The mask is designed so that when it is placed on a specific position on the source, the partially covered source emission results in forming pre-determined ultrasound fields with corresponding specific spatial pattern. With these new masks, the generated fields can be switched among several presets by changing the mask position on the source. The proposed technique only requires slight mechanical translation of the mask over the source to instantaneously reconfigure the resulting midair ultrasound field. The proposed method enables one to create a reconfigurable ultrasound field with a large source aperture in a practically feasible setup, which will potentially broaden the workspace of current midair-ultrasound applications to the whole-room scale.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable anomalous Hall plateau in antiferromagnet CoNb$_3$S$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets exhibiting the anomalous Hall effect represent a fascinating convergence of magnetism, topology, and electronic structure. Identifying antiferromagnets with large and tunable anomalous Hall effects is crucial for the development of spintronic applications. Here, we report a strain-tunable anomalous Hall plateau in CoNb$_3$S$_6$, which is a prime candidate for altermagnetism. The plateau emerges as a flat extended intermediate step of the anomalous Hall hysteresis loop with a controllable step height with temperature and strain. The remarkable tunability of the plateau position is in contrast with typical magnetic plateau associated with a field-induced metastable magnetic structure, but indicates the existence of a hidden phase transition that significantly alters the magnetic anisotropy energy without changing the magnetic order. The symmetry analysis of the strain tuning suggests that the hidden phase preserves the rotational symmetry of the ab-plane. Our results show the plateau reflects the phase coexistence during the hidden transition, and anomalous Hall resistivity of the plateau is thus non-volatile, enabling a novel four-state switching of the anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Milliwatt-level UV generation using sidewall poled lithium niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated coherent sources of ultra-violet (UV) light are essential for a wide range of applications, from ion-based quantum computing and optical clocks to gas sensing and microscopy. Conventional approaches that rely on UV gain materials face limitations in terms of wavelength versatility; in response frequency upconversion approaches that leverage various optical nonlinearities have received considerable attention. Among these, the integrated thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic platform shows particular promise owing to lithium niobate's transparency into the UV range, its strong second order nonlinearity, and high optical confinement. However, to date, the high propagation losses and lack of reliable techniques for consistent poling of cm-long waveguides with small poling periods have severely limited the utility of this platform. Here we present a sidewall poled lithium niobate (SPLN) waveguide approach that overcomes these obstacles and results in a more than two orders of magnitude increase in generated UV power compared to the state-of-the-art. Our UV SPLN waveguides feature record-low propagation losses of 2.3 dB/cm, complete domain inversion of the waveguide cross-section, and an optimum 50% duty cycle, resulting in a record-high normalized conversion efficiency of 5050 %W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$, and 4.2 mW of generated on-chip power at 390 nm wavelength. This advancement makes the TFLN photonic platform a viable option for high-quality on-chip UV generation, benefiting emerging applications.</description>

      <title>Opening and closing a bandgap via alternating softening and hardening nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown some unusual nonlinear dispersion behaviors that are disconnected from the linear regime. However, existing analytical techniques, such as perturbation methods, fail to correctly capture these behaviors. Here we propose a general theoretical approach that converts the nonlinear wave equation to an equivalent linear eigenvalue problem, which directly gives the nonlinear dispersion relation and modal vectors. The theoretical approach is employed to 1D phononic chains and 2D hexagonal lattices with alternating softening and hardening nonlinearities, revealing amplitude-induced bandgap opening and closing phenomena. The theoretical results are validated via full-scale simulations with periodic boundary conditions, in which steady-state nonlinear plane wave responses are numerically obtained. Moreover, we leverage these nonlinear phenomena to achieve tunable frequency splitting and focusing effects. Thus, our work opens new paradigms for understanding nonlinear wave physics and for achieving novel wave control capabilities.</description>

      <title>PINK: physical-informed machine learning for lattice thermal conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is crucial for efficient thermal management in electronics and energy conversion technologies. Traditional methods for predicting \k{appa}L are often computationally expensive, limiting their scalability for large-scale material screening. Empirical models, such as the Slack model, offer faster alternatives but require time-consuming calculations for key parameters such as sound velocity and the Gruneisen parameter. This work presents a high-throughput framework, physical-informed kappa (PINK), which combines the predictive power of crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs) with the physical interpretability of the Slack model to predict \k{appa}L directly from crystallographic information files (CIFs). Unlike previous approaches, PINK enables rapid, batch predictions by extracting material properties such as bulk and shear modulus from CIFs using a well-trained CGCNN model. These properties are then used to compute the necessary parameters for $\kappa_L$ calculation through a simplified physical formula. PINK was applied to a dataset of 377,221 stable materials, enabling the efficient identification of promising candidates with ultralow $\kappa_L$ values, such as Ag$_3$Te$_4$W and Ag$_3$Te$_4$Ta. The platform, accessible via a user-friendly interface, offers an unprecedented combination of speed, accuracy, and scalability, significantly accelerating material discovery for thermal management and energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>High-energy chirped nanosecond pulsed laser system for particle diagnostics and manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An upgraded high-energy nanosecond pulsed laser system tailored for optical particle diagnostics and manipulation capable of pulse energies beyond Joule-level is presented. In addition to the notable output energy increase, the laser system maintains its capability to generate laser pulses with customizable temporal profiles and variable durations ($1$ ns to $1$ $\mu$s) along with a chirping range of several GHz over the pulse duration. The expanded output energy range is anticipated to greatly broaden the laser system's application potential, both for thermodynamic diagnostics via coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering, by substantially lowering the particle density detection thresholds, as well as for particle manipulation, by facilitating more efficient optical trapping potentials for particle acceleration and deceleration.</description>

      <title>Wafer scale reactive sputter deposition of ferroelectric Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N from 300 mm AlSc Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents progress towards the large-scale manufacturability of piezo- and ferroelectric Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films with very high Sc content. Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N layers were deposited by reactive sputtering from a 300 mm diameter Al$_{0.6}$Sc$_{0.4}$N target on standard 200 mm Si wafers with Pt bottom- and Mo top-electrodes. The deposited films were analyzed in depth with X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Reciprocal Space Mapping (RSM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) showing well oriented c-axis growth over the full wafer with slight variation in the film thickness and Sc content over the wafer radius. An overall low density of abnormally oriented grains (AOG) was found. Further wafer mapping for piezoelectric and dielectric properties showed a piezoelectric performance increase by 40 % in comparison to Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N while only moderately increasing the permittivity and loss factor. Switching measurements revealed ferroelectric behavior of the film on all measured positions with an average remanent polarization of 88.36 uC/cm$^2$ and an average coercive field of 244 V/um. This successful demonstration opens new opportunities for MEMS applications with demands for high forces like microspeakers or quasi static micromirrors.</description>

      <title>Dual phase transitions in a 1D lattice with PT-symmetric Floquet defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems with non-Hermitian potential or Floquet modulation often result in phase transition related phenomena. In this paper, we study the dual phase transitions in a one-dimensional lattice by introducing a defect containing both Floquet modulation and PT-symmetric potential. In such a configuration, we demonstrate how the gain-loss from PT-symmetry and the control parameters in Floquet modulation adjust the wave dynamic behaviors. When these parameters change, the system will undergo dual phase transitions from an energy-delocalized phase to a localized phase where energy oscillates with time, and then to a PT-symmetry broken phase with energy boost. In particular, we find that the energy oscillations in the second phase is resulted from the beating of two energy oscillations: one is introduced by the PT-symmetric potential and the other is introduced by the Floquet modulation, rather than the field interference of the defect modes. Furthermore, we find that the first phase transition can be non-exist and the second phase transition is affected by the Floquet parameters. Our results reveal the underlying physics of dual phase transitions that occur in simple lattice systems with PT-symmetric Floquet defect, which extends the study of non-Hermitian Floquet systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we report on controlling strain in graphene by trapping molecules at the graphene-substrate interface, leveraging molecular dipole moments. Spectroscopic and transport measurements show that strain correlates with the dipole moments of trapped molecules, with a dipole range of 1.5 D to 4.9 D resulting in a 50-fold increase in strain and a substantial rise in the residual carrier density. This has been possible by charge transfer between graphene and trapped molecules, altering the C=C bond length, and causing biaxial strain. First-principles density functional theory calculations confirm a consistent dependence of bending height on molecular dipole moments.</description>

      <title>All-optical autoencoder machine learning framework using linear diffractive processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), known for its high speed and strong parallelism, has been widely applied across various fields, including pattern recognition, image processing, and image transmission. However, existing network architectures primarily focus on data representation within the original domain, with limited exploration of the latent space, thereby restricting the information mining capabilities and multifunctional integration of D2NNs. Here, we propose an all-optical autoencoder (OAE) framework that linearly encodes the input wavefield into a prior shape distribution in the diffractive latent space (DLS) and decodes the encoded pattern back to the original wavefield. By leveraging the bidirectional multiplexing property of D2NN, the OAE models function as encoders in one direction of wave propagation and as decoders in the opposite direction. We further apply the models to three key areas: image denoising, noise-resistant reconfigurable image classification, and image generation. Proof-of-concept experiments have been conducted to validate numerical simulations. Our OAE framework fully exploits the potential of latent representations, enabling a single set of diffractive processors to simultaneously achieve image reconstruction, representation, and generation. This work not only offers fresh insights into the design of optical generative models but also paves the way for developing multifunctional, highly integrated, and general optical intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient inverse design of large-area metasurfaces for incoherent light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incoherent light is ubiquitous, yet designing optical devices that can handle its random nature is very challenging, since directly averaging over many incoherent incident beams can require a huge number of scattering calculations. We show how to instead solve this problem with a reciprocity technique which leads to three orders of magnitude speedup: one Maxwell solve (using any numerical technique) instead of thousands. This improvement enables us to perform efficient inverse design, large scale optimization of the metasurface for applications such as light collimators and concentrators. We show the impact of the angular distribution of incident light on the resulting performance, and show especially promising designs for the case of "annular" beams distributed only over nonzero angles.</description>

      <title>A gradient atmospheric model reveals enhanced radiative cooling potential and demonstrates the advantages of broadband emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive radiative cooling toward the sky is a developing technology for adaptation in hot climates. Previous calculations of cooling performance have generally used uniform atmospheric models that assume a single sky temperature and atmospheric transmittance spectrum. Here, we introduce a gradient atmospheric model that accounts for altitude-dependent temperature and gas composition, revealing that uniform models underestimate cooling power by 10 - 40%. Using our improved model, we systematically compared broadband emitters (BEs) and wavelength-selective emitters (SEs) for sky-facing radiative cooling at various locations on Earth. We find that the differences in cooling power between the two types of emitters in the sub-ambient temperature range are generally small, even under ideal conditions. Furthermore, in practice, BEs actually have superior performance than realistic SEs, because they have fewer design degrees of freedom and thus can be engineered to have lower solar absorption. Our analysis suggests that large-scale deployment of sky-facing passive radiative cooling technologies should prioritize the development of scalable, low-cost surfaces with minimal solar absorption, rather than focusing on achieving selective thermal emission.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations are employed to study particle kinetics and power deposition in inductively coupled plasmas. We show that in the regime of low frequency ($\sim\mathrm{MHz}$) and low pressure, the motion of electrons can be highly nonlinear in the skin region near the antenna coil. Through most of the RF cycle, the electrons are strongly magnetized, with energy deposition being small. However, for a brief period around the null of the oscillating magnetic field, the electrons demagnetize, causing a jet-like current penetrating into the bulk plasma. During these brief periods, the power deposition becomes high, exhibiting a periodic burst nature. Based on kinetic theory, we provide new analytical expressions for the plasma current and energy deposition. A criterion for transition between the newly identified low-frequency, periodic-burst regime and the usual anomalous non-local skin effect regime is proposed and verified using a series of fully kinetic 2D particle-in-cell simulations.</description>
