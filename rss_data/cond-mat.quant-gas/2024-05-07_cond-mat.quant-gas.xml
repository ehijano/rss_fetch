      <title>Absence of binding of heavy fermions by two light atoms in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By developing the mean-field theory valid for large $N$, we investigate the problem of two light fermions interacting via a zero-range potential with $N$ heavy fermions in two dimensions. We obtain numerical evidence that this system is never fully bound. It always splits into droplets containing a single light atom. This is in contrast to the one-dimensional case where any number of heavy and light fermions can be bound together.</description>

      <title>Ground-state properties of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling and quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state properties of dipolar spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensates with quantum fluctuations and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The combined effects of dipole-dipole interaction (DDI), SOC, and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction induced by quantum fluctuations on the ground-state structures and spin textures of the system are analyzed and discussed. For the nonrotating case and fixed nonlinear interspecies contact interaction strengths, our results show that structural phase transitions can be achieved by adjusting the strengths of the DDI and LHY correction. In the absence of SOC, a ground-state phase diagram is given with respect to the DDI strength and the LHY correction strength. We find that the system exhibits rich quantum phases including square droplet lattice phase, annular phase, loop-island structure, stripe-droplet coexistence phase, toroidal stripe phase, and Thomas-Fermi (TF) phase. For the rotating case, the increase of DDI strength can lead to a quantum phase transition from superfluid phase to supersolid phase. In the presence of SOC, the quantum droplets display obvious stretching and hidden vortex-antivortex clusters are formed in each component. In particular, weak or moderate SOC favors the formation of droplets while for strong SOC the ground state of the system develops into a stripe phase with hidden vortex-antivortex clusters. Furthermore, the system sustains exotic spin textures and topological excitations, such as composite skyrmion-antiskyrmion-meron-antimeron cluster, meron-antimeron string cluster, antimeron-meron-antimeron chain cluster, and peculiar skyrmion-antiskyrmion-meron-antimeron necklace with a meron-antimeron necklace embedded inside and a central spin Neel domain wall.</description>

      <title>Maxwell relation between entropy and atom-atom pair correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many-particle systems with short range interactions the local (same point) particle-particle pair correlation function represents a thermodynamic quantity that can be calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Here we exploit this property to derive a thermodynamic Maxwell relation between the local pair correlation and the entropy of an ultracold Bose gas in one dimension (1D). To demonstrate the utility of this Maxwell relation, we apply it to the computational formalism of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevski equation (SPGPE) to determine the entropy of a finite-temperature 1D Bose gas from its atom-atom pair correlation function. Such a correlation function is easy to compute numerically within the SPGPE and other formalisms, which is unlike computing the entropy itself. Our calculations can be viewed as a numerical experiment that serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration of an experimental method to deduce the entropy of a quantum gas from the measured atom-atom correlations.</description>

      <title>Interplay between short-range and critical long-range fluctuations in the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density at quantum transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density in many-body systems undergoing quantum transitions driven by the chemical potential $\mu$. They originate from a nontrivial interplay between noncritical short-range and critical long-range quantum fluctuations. As a paradigmatic model we consider the one-dimensional fermionic Kitaev chain, for which very accurate numerical checks of our scaling ansatz can be performed up to $O(10^4)$ sites. The search for dynamic scaling behaviors of the particle density is complicated by the fact that its equilibrium (ground state) behavior is dominated by short-range fluctuations, giving rise to regular background terms and peculiar logarithmic terms from resonances between renormalization-group perturbations associated with the energy and identity operator families within the conformal field theory. To study these issues, we focus on two dynamic protocols, either instantaneous quenches or quasi-adiabatic changes of $\mu$ to the critical value $\mu_c$, unveiling out-of-equilibrium scaling behaviors of the particle density, which arise from the critical modes, within a dynamic finite-size scaling framework.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <title>Coexisting N\'eel and charge density wave orders in attractive three-color fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In optical lattices attractive ultracold fermions with three hyperfine-spin components (colors) can form three fermionic configurations depending on interactions: unbound fermion, on-site trion and off-site trion, leading to the coexistence of multiple Fermi species in the ordered phase, which manifests that the attractive three-color fermions are unique from other correlated fermion systems and may host intriguing phases and phase transitions. At temperature below the superexchange energy scale, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to investigate the phases and phase transitions in the half-filled attractive three-color Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice where Hubbard interactions are color-dependent (anisotropic interactions) and the coupling between color 3 and colors (1, 2) serves as a control parameter. In the coupling regime where on-site and off-site trions coexist, our QMC simulations demonstrate coexisting N\'eel and charge density wave orders which are common in condensed matter but rare in ultracold atoms. At weak coupling where the color superfluid (CSF) order is scattered by color-3 fermions, we find that very small coupling of color 3 with colors (1, 2) can destroy the CSF order and the vanishing of the CSF order is not immediately accompanied by the emergence of the on-site trionic phase, which strikingly disagrees with the prevalent results of dynamical mean-field theory. The underlying mechanisms of the coexisting charge/spin orders and the CSF order breaking are also presented based on intuitive physical pictures.</description>

      <title>Simulating a two component Bose-Hubbard model with imbalanced hopping in a Rydberg tweezer array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays of neutral atoms provide a versatile platform for quantum simulation due to the range of interactions and Hamiltonians that can be realized and explored. We propose to simulate a two-component Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping using arrays of multilevel Rydberg atoms featuring resonant dipolar interactions. The diversity of states that can be used to encode the local Hilbert space of the Bose-Hubbard model enables control of the relative hopping rate of each component and even the realization of spin-flip hopping. We use numerical simulations to show how multilevel Rydberg atoms provide an opportunity to explore the diverse non-equilibrium quench dynamics of the model. For example, we demonstrate a separation of the relaxation timescales of effective spin and charge degrees of freedom, and observe regimes of slow relaxation when the effective hopping rates of the two components are vastly different due to dynamical constraints arising from hardcore boson interactions. We discuss prospects for studying these effects in state-of-the-art Rydberg tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Exploring spin-squeezing in the Mott insulating regime: role of anisotropy, inhomogeneity and hole doping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-squeezing in systems with single-particle control is a well-established resource of modern quantum technology. Applied in an optical lattice clock can reduce the statistical uncertainty of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we consider dynamic generation of spin-squeezing with ultra-cold bosonic atoms with two internal states loaded into an optical lattice in the strongly interacting regime as realized with state-of-the-art experiments using a quantum gas microscope. We show that anisotropic interactions and inhomogeneous magnetic fields generate scalable spin-squeezing if their magnitudes are sufficiently small, but not negligible. The effect of non-uniform filling caused by hole doping, non-zero temperature and external confinement is studied at a microscopic level demonstrating their limiting role in the dynamics and scaling of spin squeezing.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spatial phase coherence in a dissipative Bose-Hubbard atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the loss of spatial coherence of one-dimensional bosonic gases in optical lattices illuminated by a near-resonant excitation laser. Because the atoms recoil in a random direction after each spontaneous emission, the atomic momentum distribution progressively broadens. Equivalently, the spatial correlation function (the Fourier-conjugate quantity of the momentum distribution) progressively narrows down as more photons are scattered. Here we measure the correlation function of the matter field for fixed distances corresponding to nearest-neighbor (n-n) and next-nearest-neighbor (n-n-n) sites of the optical lattice as a function of time, hereafter called n-n and n-n-n correlators. For strongly interacting lattice gases, we find that the n-n correlator $C_1$ decays as a power-law at long times, $C_1\propto 1/t^{\alpha}$, in stark contrast with the exponential decay expected for independent particles. The power-law decay reflects a non-trivial dissipative many-body dynamics, where interactions change drastically the interplay between fluorescence destroying spatial coherence, and coherent tunnelling between neighboring sites restoring spatial coherence at short distances. The observed decay exponent $\alpha \approx 0.54(6) $ is in good agreement with the prediction $\alpha=1/2$ from a dissipative Bose-Hubbard model accounting for the fluorescence-induced decoherence. Furthermore, we find that the n-n correlator $C_1$ controls the n-n-n correlator $C_2$ through the relation $C_2 \approx C_1^2$, also in accordance with the dissipative Bose-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Mixed-state Quantum Topological Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison to the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state quantum topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state quantum topological order, and reveal the existence of non-bosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states %must be bipartite long-range entangled for any bipartition. That is, such mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler laser cooling and magnetic trapping of natural-abundance fermionic potassium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on reaching sub-Doppler temperatures of $^{40}$K in a single-chamber setup using a dispenser-based potassium source with natural (0.012$\%$ of $^{40}$K) isotopic composition. With gray molasses cooling on the $D_1$-line following a standard $D_2$-line magneto-optical trap, we obtain $3\times10^5$ atoms at $\sim$10~\textmu K. We reach densities high enough to measure the temperature via absorption imaging using the time-of-flight method. Directly after sub-Doppler cooling we pump atoms into the $F=7/2$ hyperfine ground state and transfer a mixture of $m_F=-3/2,-5/2$ and $-7/2$ Zeeman states into the magnetic trap. We trap $5\times10^4$ atoms with a lifetime of 0.6~s when the dispensers are heated up to maximize the atom number at a cost of deteriorated background gas pressure. When the dispensers have been off for a day and the magneto-optical trap loading rate has been increased by light induced atomic desorption we can magnetically trap $\sim$$10^3$ atoms with a lifetime of 2.8~s. The background pressure-limited lifetime of 0.6~s is a reasonable starting point for proof-of-principle experiments with atoms and/or molecules in optical tweezers as well as for sympathetic cooling with another species if transport to a secondary chamber is implemented.
  Our results show that unenriched potassium can be used to optimize experimental setups containing $^{40}$K in the initial stages of their construction, which can effectively extend the lifetime of enriched sources needed for proper experiments. Moreover, demonstration of sub-Doppler cooling and magnetic trapping of a relatively small number of potassium atoms might influence experiments with laser cooled radioactive isotopes of potassium.</description>
