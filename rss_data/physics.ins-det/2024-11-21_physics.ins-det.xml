      <title>Angle measurement method of electronic speckle interferometry based on Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {This paper proposes an angle measurement method based on Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) using a Michelson interferometer. By leveraging different principles within the same device, this method achieves complementary advantages across various angle ranges, enhancing measurement accuracy while maintaining high robustness. By utilizing CCD to record light field information in real time and combining geometric and ESPI methods, relationships between small angles and light field information are established, allowing for the design of relevant algorithms for real-time angle measurement. Numerical simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the feasibility and practicality of this method. Results indicate that it maintains measurement accuracy while offering a wide angle measurement range, effectively addressing the limitations of small angle measurements in larger ranges, showcasing significant potential for widespread applications in related fields.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Kikuchi Diffraction Geometries in Scanning Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in scanning electron microscope (SEM) based Kikuchi diffraction have demonstrated the important potential for reflection and transmission methods, like transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Furthermore, with the advent of compact direct electron detectors (DED) it has been possible to place the detector in a variety of configurations within the SEM chamber. This motivates the present work where we explore the similarities and differences of the different geometries that include on-axis TKD &amp; off-axis TKD using electron transparent samples, as well as more conventional EBSD. Furthermore, we compare these with the newest method called "reflection Kikuchi diffraction" RKD where the sample is placed flat in the chamber and the detector is placed below the pole piece. Through remapping collected diffraction patterns, all these methods can be used to generate an experimental "diffraction sphere" that can be used to explore diffraction from any scattering vector from the unit cell, as well as the ability to perform band profile analysis. This diffraction sphere approach enables us to further probe specific differences between the methods, including for example thickness effects in TKD that can result in the generation of diffraction spots, as well as electron scattering path length effects that result in excess and deficiency variations, as well as inversion of bands in experimental patterns.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.</description>

      <title>On the determination of the interaction time of GeV neutrinos in large argon gas TPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation megawatt-scale neutrino beams open the way to studying neutrino-nucleus scattering using gaseous targets for the first time. This represents an opportunity to improve the knowledge of neutrino cross sections in the energy region between hundreds of MeV and a few GeV, of interest for the upcoming generation of long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The challenge is to accurately track and (especially) time the particles produced in neutrino interactions in large and seamless volumes down to few-MeV energies. We propose to accomplish this through an optically-read time projection chamber (TPC) filled with high-pressure argon and equipped with both tracking and timing functions. In this work, we present a detailed study of the time-tagging capabilities of such a device, based on end-to-end optical simulations that include the effect of photon propagation, photosensor response, dark count rate and pulse reconstruction. We show that the neutrino interaction time can be reconstructed from the primary scintillation signal with a precision in the range of 1-2.5 ns ($\sigma$) for point-like deposits with energies down to 5 MeV. A similar response is observed for minimum-ionizing particle tracks extending over lengths of a few meters. A discussion on previous limitations towards such a detection technology, and how they can be realistically overcome in the near future thanks to recent developments in the field, is presented. The performance demonstrated in our analysis seems to be well within reach of next-generation neutrino-oscillation experiments, through the instrumentation of the proposed TPC with conventional reflective materials and a silicon photomultiplier array behind a transparent cathode.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a radiation detector based on opaque water-based liquid scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the characterization of a novel radiation detector based on an opaque water-based liquid scintillator. Opaque scintillators, also known as LiquidO, are made to be highly scattering, such that the scintillation light is effectively confined, and read out through wavelength-shifting fibers. The 1-liter, 32-channel prototype demonstrates the capability for both spectroscopy and topological reconstruction of point-like events. The design, construction, and evaluation of the detector are described, including modeling of the scintillation liquid optical properties and the detector's response to gamma rays of several energies. A mean position reconstruction error of 4.4 mm for 1.6 MeV-equivalent events and 7.4 mm for 0.8 MeV-equivalent events is demonstrated using a simple reconstruction approach analogous to center-of-mass.</description>

      <title>The optimal structure of the MRPC detector for 0.511 MeV gamma based on Monte Carlo simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detailed simulation of the Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs) provides the performance characteristics of MRPCs with different numbers of gas gaps and gap thicknesses. This helps in optimizing the structure of MRPCs under specific conditions by balancing time resolution, detection efficiency, and other performance metrics. To obtain the optimal structure of MRPCs for 0.511 MeV gammas, a complete simulation framework for gamma detection by the MRPCs based on Geant4 and Magboltz software is described in this paper. The simulation shows how gamma interacts with MRPCs and the process of gas ionization, avalanche multiplication, and signal formation. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. By analyzing the time resolution and detection efficiency, the optimal structure of MRPCs for 0.511 MeV gammas is proposed.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the minimal coupling of horizontal accelerations to rotations in a torsion balance suspended from three wires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cavendish torsion balance is the instrument of choice for measuring weak forces, such as gravity. Although torsion balances have extremely high sensitivity for measuring forces over ranges of a few cm and more, their dynamics make it difficult to extend this range to much less than fractions of mm. In particular forces such as the Casimir force are usually studied using atomic force microscopes. We present results of our studies of a simple torsion balance with a 3-wire suspension. This device should be able to maintain parallelism between flat plates of areas of a few $\sim\mathrm{cm^2}$ at separations of much less of 10's of $\mathrm{\mu m}$. In this paper we describe our experimental investigation into the coupling of ground tilt to the torsional rotation of the novel device. We show that, like the Cavendish torsion balance, the 3-wire torsion balance is highly insensitive to tilts. We also demonstrate that this tilt sensitivity is itself insensitive to shifts in the centre of mass position of the suspended mass. We discuss simple models of the 3-wire torsion balance that show that it is only the static wire lengths that determine the coupling of tilts and horizontal accelerations. We also discuss designs of torsion balances where sensitivity and noise rejection to tilts are optimised.</description>
