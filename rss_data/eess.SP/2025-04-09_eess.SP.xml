      <title>Large-Scale Classification of Shortwave Communication Signals with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning approach to the classification of 160 shortwave radio signals. It addresses the typical challenges of the shortwave spectrum, which are the large number of different signal types, the presence of various analog modulations and ionospheric propagation. As a classifier a deep convolutional neural network is used, that is trained to recognize 160 typical shortwave signal classes. The approach is blind and therefore does not require preknowledge or special preprocessing of the signal and no manual design of discriminative features for each signal class. The network is trained on a large number of synthetically generated signals and high quality recordings. Finally, the network is evaluated on real-world radio signals obtained from globally deployed receiver hardware and achieves up to 90% accuracy for an observation time of only 1 second.</description>

      <title>A Solid-State Nanopore Signal Generator for Training Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translocation event detection from raw nanopore current signals is a fundamental step in nanopore signal analysis. Traditional data analysis methods rely on user-defined parameters to extract event information, making the interpretation of experimental results sensitive to parameter choice. While Machine Learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across various scientific fields, its potential remains underexplored in solid-state nanopore research.
  In this work, we introduce a nanopore signal generator capable of producing extensive synthetic datasets for machine learning applications and benchmarking nanopore signal analysis platforms. Using this generator, we train deep learning models to detect translocation events directly from raw signals, achieving over 99% true event detection with minimal false positives.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient numerical method for calculating spatial power profiles of both signal and pump with significant Interchannel Stimulated Raman Scattering (ISRS) and backward Raman amplification in multiband systems. This method was evaluated in the optimization of a C+L+S/C+L+S+E 1000km link, employing three backward Raman pumps, by means of a closed-form EGN model (CFM6). The results show a 100x computational speed increase, enabling deep optimization which made it possible to obtain very good overall system performance and flat GSNR.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the preamble detection problem in the Random Access procedure of LTE/5G networks by formulating it as a multi-class classification task and evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning techniques. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is implemented and compared against conventional detection methods. The proposed approach improves preamble index assignment, enhancing detection efficiency for User Equipment (UE) accessing the network. Performance analysis demonstrates that the SVM-based solution increases detection accuracy while reducing missed detections. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning in optimizing the Random Access procedure and improving network accessibility.</description>

      <title>Unimodular Waveform Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication MIMO System via Manifold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been widely recognized as one of the key technologies for 6G wireless networks. In this paper, we focus on the waveform design of ISAC system, which can realize radar sensing while also facilitate information transmission. The main content is as follows: first, we formulate the waveform design problem as a nonconvex and non-smooth model with a unimodulus constraint based on the measurement metric of the radar and communication system. Second, we transform the model into an unconstrained problem on the Riemannian manifold and construct the corresponding operators by analyzing the unimodulus constraint. Third, to achieve the solution efficiently, we propose a low-complexity non-smooth unimodulus manifold gradient descent (N-UMGD) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantee. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can concentrate the energy of the sensing signal in the desired direction and realize information transmission with a low bit error rate.</description>

      <title>Fair Resource Allocation in UAV-based Semantic Communication System with Fluid Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of maximization of the minimum equivalent rate in a unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-based multi-user semantic communication system is investigated. In the considered model, a multi-antenna UAV employs semantic extraction techniques to compress the data ready to be sent to the users, which are equipped with fluid antennas. Our aim is to jointly optimize the trajectory of the UAV, the transmit beamforming and the semantic compression rate at the UAV, as well as the selection of activated ports in fluid antenna system (FAS), to maximize the minimum equivalent transmission rate among all user. An alternating algorithm is designed to solve the problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unimodular Waveform Design that Minimizes PSL of Ambiguity Function over A Continuous Doppler Frequency Shift Region of Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In active sensing systems, waveforms with ambiguity functions (AFs) of low peak sidelobe levels (PSLs) across a time delay and Doppler frequency shift plane (delay-Doppler plane) of interest are desirable for reducing false alarms. Additionally, unimodular waveforms are preferred due to hardware limitations. In this paper, a new method is proposed to design unimodular waveforms with PSL suppression over a continuous Doppler frequency shift region, based on the discrete-time ambiguity function (DTAF). Compared with existing methods that suppress PSL over grid points in the delay-Doppler plane by using the discrete ambiguity function (DAF), we regard the DTAF optimization problem as of more practical interest because the Doppler frequency shifts observed in echo signals reflected from targets are inherently continuous rather than discrete. The problem of interest is formulated as an optimization problem with infinite constraints along with unimodular constraints. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a problem has not been studied yet. We propose to reformulate a non-convex semi-infinite programming (SIP) to a semidefinite programming (SDP) with a finite number of constraints and a rank-one constraint, which is then solved by the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in achieving a lower PSL of AF over a continuous Doppler frequency shift region of interest. Moreover, the designed waveform can effectively prevent false alarms when detecting a target with an arbitrary velocity.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity SDP-ADMM for Physical-Layer Multicasting in Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a demand for the same data content from several user equipments (UEs) in many wireless communication applications. Physical-layer multicasting combines the beamforming capability of massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) and the broadcast nature of the wireless channel to efficiently deliver the same data to a group of UEs using a single transmission. This paper tackles the max-min fair (MMF) multicast beamforming optimization, which is an NP-hard problem. We develop an efficient semidefinite program-alternating direction method of multipliers (SDP-ADMM) algorithm to find the near-global optimal rank-1 solution to the MMF multicast problem in a massive MIMO system. Numerical results show that the proposed SDP-ADMM algorithm exhibits similar spectral efficiency performance to state-of-the-art algorithms running on standard SDP solvers at a vastly reduced computational complexity. We highlight that the proposed ADMM elimination procedure can be employed as an effective low-complexity rank reduction method for other problems utilizing semidefinite relaxation.</description>

      <title>Status Updating with Time Stamp Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A status updating system is considered in which multiple processes are sampled and transmitted through a shared channel. Each process has its dedicated server that processes its samples before time stamping them for transmission. Time stamps, however, are prone to errors, and hence the status updates received may not be credible. Our setting models the time stamp error rate as a function of the servers' busy times. Hence, to reduce errors and enhance credibility, servers need to process samples on a relatively prolonged schedule. This, however, deteriorates timeliness, which is captured through the age of information (AoI) metric. An optimization problem is formulated whose goal to characterize the optimal processes' schedule and sampling instances to achieve the optimal trade-off between timeliness and credibility. The problem is first solved for a single process setting, where it is shown that a threshold-based sleep-wake schedule is optimal, in which the server wakes up and is allowed to process newly incoming samples only if the AoI surpasses a certain threshold that depends on the required timeliness-credibility trade-off. Such insights are then extended to the multi-process setting, where two main scheduling and sleep-wake policies, namely round-robin scheduling with threshold-waiting and asymmetric scheduling with zero-waiting, are introduced and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Robust and Efficient Average Consensus with Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-coherent over-the-air (OTA) computation has garnered increasing attention for its advantages in facilitating information aggregation among distributed agents in resource-constrained networks without requiring precise channel estimation. A promising application scenario of this method is distributed average consensus in wireless multi-agent systems. However, in such scenario, non-coherent interference from concurrent OTA transmissions can introduce bias in the consensus value. To address this issue, we develop a robust distributed average consensus algorithm by formulating the consensus problem as a distributed optimization problem. Using decentralized projected gradient descent (D-PGD), our proposed algorithm can achieve unbiased mean square average consensus even in the presence of non-coherent interference and noise. Additionally, we implement transmit power control and receive scaling mechanisms to further accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the convergence speed of the D-PGD algorithm for OTA average consensus without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Matched Topological Subspace Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes, capture richer relationships than graphs by modeling interactions not only between nodes but also among higher-order entities, such as edges or triangles. This motivates the representation of information defined in irregular domains as topological signals. By leveraging the spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, practical topological signals often concentrate in specific spectral subspaces (e.g., gradient or curl). For instance, in a foreign currency exchange network, the exchange flow signals typically satisfy the arbitrage-free condition and hence are curl-free. However, the presence of anomalies can disrupt these conditions, causing the signals to deviate from such subspaces. In this work, we formulate a hypothesis testing framework to detect whether simplicial complex signals lie in specific subspaces in a principled and tractable manner. Concretely, we propose Neyman-Pearson matched topological subspace detectors for signals defined at a single simplicial level (such as edges) or jointly across all levels of a simplicial complex. The (energy-based projection) proposed detectors handle missing values, provide closed-form performance analysis, and effectively capture the unique topological properties of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topological detectors on various real-world data, including foreign currency exchange networks.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Matching Pursuit based Reconstruction for Modulo Hysteresis Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlimited sampling provides an acquisition scheme for high dynamic range signals by folding the signal into the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using modulo non-linearity prior to sampling to prevent saturation. Recently, a generalized scheme called modulo hysteresis was introduced to account for hardware non-idealities. The encoding operator, however, does not guarantee that the output signal is within the dynamic range of the ADC. To resolve this, we propose a modified modulo hysteresis operator and show identifiability of bandlimited signals from modulo hysteresis samples. We propose a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit and validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modality Sensing in mmWave Beamforming for Connected Vehicles Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beamforming techniques are considered as essential parts to compensate severe path losses in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. In particular, these techniques adopt large antenna arrays and formulate narrow beams to obtain satisfactory received powers. However, performing accurate beam alignment over narrow beams for efficient link configuration by traditional standard defined beam selection approaches, which mainly rely on channel state information and beam sweeping through exhaustive searching, imposes computational and communications overheads. And, such resulting overheads limit their potential use in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications involving highly dynamic scenarios. In comparison, utilizing out-of-band contextual information, such as sensing data obtained from sensor devices, provides a better alternative to reduce overheads. This paper presents a deep learning-based solution for utilizing the multi-modality sensing data for predicting the optimal beams having sufficient mmWave received powers so that the best V2I and V2V line-of-sight links can be ensured proactively. The proposed solution has been tested on real-world measured mmWave sensing and communication data, and the results show that it can achieve up to 98.19% accuracies while predicting top-13 beams. Correspondingly, when compared to existing been sweeping approach, the beam sweeping searching space and time overheads are greatly shortened roughly by 79.67% and 91.89%, respectively which confirm a promising solution for beamforming in mmWave enabled communications.</description>

      <title>Streaming Heteroscedastic Probabilistic PCA with Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Streaming principal component analysis (PCA) is an integral tool in large-scale machine learning for rapidly estimating low-dimensional subspaces from very high-dimensional data arriving at a high rate. However, modern datasets increasingly combine data from a variety of sources, and thus may exhibit heterogeneous quality across samples. Standard streaming PCA algorithms do not account for non-uniform noise, so their subspace estimates can quickly degrade. While the recently proposed Heteroscedastic Probabilistic PCA Technique (HePPCAT) addresses this heterogeneity, it was not designed to handle streaming data, which may exhibit non-stationary behavior. Moreover, HePPCAT does not allow for missing entries in the data, which can be common in streaming data. This paper proposes the Streaming HeteroscedASTic Algorithm for PCA (SHASTA-PCA) to bridge this divide. SHASTA-PCA employs a stochastic alternating expectation maximization approach that jointly learns the low-rank latent factors and the unknown noise variances from streaming data that may have missing entries and heteroscedastic noise, all while maintaining a low memory and computational footprint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior subspace estimation of our method compared to state-of-the-art streaming PCA algorithms in the heteroscedastic setting. Finally, we illustrate SHASTA-PCA applied to highly heterogeneous real data from astronomy.</description>

      <title>Designing Unimodular Waveforms for MIMO Radar Based on Manifold Optimization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we design unimodular waveforms with good correlation properties for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar systems. Specifically, first, we analyze the geometric properties of the unimodular constraint in the fourth-order polynomial minimization problem using Riemannian geometry theory. By embedding it into the search space, we transform the original non-convex optimization problem into an unconstrained problem on a Riemannian manifold. Then, we construct the manifold corresponding to the search space and the operators required for the customized optimization algorithm. Second, we develop a customized low-complexity unimodular manifold gradient descent (UM-GD) algorithm on the constructed manifold to solve the optimization problem in the normal-scale case, and propose its acceleration version unimodular manifold accelerated gradient descent (UM-AGD) algorithm, to speed up the convergence. In the large-scale case, we transform the objective function into the form of a summation of a large but finite number of loss functions and develop a customized unimodular manifold stochastic variance reduced gradient (UM-SVRG) algorithm to solve this problem. Compared to the existing bechmark method, which has a computational complexity of roughly $\mathcal{O}(M^4+3M^2N+3|\mathcal{D}| |\hat{\Theta}|^2MN)$, UM-SVRG algorithm effectively reduces the computational complexity of each iteration to roughly $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{D}||\hat{\Theta}|^2MN)$. Thirdly, we provide theoretical guarantees of convergence for both the UM-GD and UM-SVRG algorithms through appropriate parameter selection, and prove that the proposed algorithms can converge to a stationary point. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UM-GD and UM-SVRG algorithms.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Awareness in Wireless Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless communications and sensing (WCS) establish the backbone of modern information exchange and environment perception. Typical applications range from mobile networks and the Internet of Things to radar and sensor grids. Despite transformative capabilities, wireless systems often face diverse uncertainties in design and operation, such as modeling errors due to incomplete physical knowledge, statistical errors arising from data scarcity, measurement errors caused by sensor imperfections, computational errors owing to resource limitation, and unpredictability of environmental evolution. Once ignored, these uncertainties can lead to severe outcomes, e.g., performance degradation, system untrustworthiness, inefficient resource utilization, and security vulnerabilities. As such, this article reviews mature and emerging architectural, computational, and operational countermeasures, encompassing uncertainty-aware designs of signals and systems (e.g., diversity, adaptivity, modularity), as well as uncertainty-aware modeling and computational frameworks (e.g., risk-informed optimization, robust signal processing, and trustworthy machine learning). Trade-offs to employ these methods, e.g., robustness vs optimality, are also highlighted.</description>

      <title>A Semidefinite Relaxation for Sums of Heterogeneous Quadratic Forms on the Stiefel Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the maximization of sums of heterogeneous quadratic forms over the Stiefel manifold, a nonconvex problem that arises in several modern signal processing and machine learning applications such as heteroscedastic probabilistic principal component analysis (HPPCA). In this work, we derive a novel semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation of the original problem and study a few of its theoretical properties. We prove a global optimality certificate for the original nonconvex problem via a dual certificate, which leads to a simple feasibility problem to certify global optimality of a candidate solution on the Stiefel manifold. In addition, our relaxation reduces to an assignment linear program for jointly diagonalizable problems and is therefore known to be tight in that case. We generalize this result to show that it is also tight for close-to jointly diagonalizable problems, and we show that the HPPCA problem has this characteristic. Numerical results validate our global optimality certificate and sufficient conditions for when the SDP is tight in various problem settings.</description>

      <title>Modulated Differentiable STFT and Balanced Spectrum Metric for Freight Train Wheelset Bearing Cross-machine Transfer Fault Diagnosis under Speed Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The service conditions of wheelset bearings has a direct impact on the safe operation of railway heavy haul freight trains as the key components. However, speed fluctuation of the trains and few fault samples are the two main problems that restrict the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis. Therefore, a cross-machine transfer diagnosis (pyDSN) network coupled with interpretable modulated differentiable short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and physics-informed balanced spectrum quality metric is proposed to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features under time-varying speeds. Firstly, due to insufficiency in extracting extract frequency components of time-varying speed signals using fixed windows, a modulated differentiable STFT (MDSTFT) that is interpretable with STFT-informed theoretical support, is proposed to extract the robust time-frequency spectrum (TFS). During training process, multiple windows with different lengths dynamically change. Also, in addition to the classification metric and domain discrepancy metric, we creatively introduce a third kind of metric, referred to as the physics-informed metric, to enhance transferable TFS. A physics-informed balanced spectrum quality (BSQ) regularization loss is devised to guide an optimization direction for MDSTFT and model. With it, not only can model acquire high-quality TFS, but also a physics-restricted domain adaptation network can be also acquired, making it learn real-world physics knowledge, ultimately diminish the domain discrepancy across different datasets. The experiment is conducted in the scenario of migrating from the laboratory datasets to the freight train dataset, indicating that the hybrid-driven pyDSN outperforms existing methods and has practical value.</description>

      <title>Channel Charting in Real-World Coordinates with Distributed MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Channel charting is an emerging self-supervised method that maps channel-state information (CSI) to a low-dimensional latent space (the channel chart) that represents pseudo-positions of user equipments (UEs). While channel charts preserve local geometry, i.e., nearby UEs are nearby in the channel chart (and vice versa), the pseudo-positions are in arbitrary coordinates and global geometry is typically not preserved. In order to embed channel charts in real-world coordinates, we first propose a bilateration loss for distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) wireless systems in which only the access point (AP) positions are known. The idea behind this loss is to compare the received power at pairs of APs to determine whether a UE should be placed closer to one AP or the other in the channel chart. We then propose a line-of-sight (LoS) bounding-box loss that places the UE in a predefined LoS area of each AP that is estimated to have a LoS path to the UE. We demonstrate the efficacy of combining both of these loss functions with neural-network-based channel charting using ray-tracing-based and measurement-based channel vectors. Our proposed approach outperforms several baselines and maintains the self-supervised nature of channel charting as it neither relies on geometrical propagation models nor on any ground-truth UE position information.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Holographic Beamforming via Dynamic Metasurface Antennas in QoS Guaranteed Power Efficient Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on designing a power-efficient network for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMA)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) antenna systems. Power efficiency is achieved through holographic beamforming in a DMA-aided network, minimizing total transmission power while ensuring a guaranteed signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) for multiple users in downlink. Unlike conventional MISO systems, which have well-explored beamforming solutions, DMA require specialized methods due to their unique physical constraints and wave-domain precoding capabilities. To achieve this, optimization algorithms relying on alternating optimization and semi-definite programming, are developed, including spherical-wave channel modelling of near-field communication. In this setup, the beamforming performance of DMA-aided precoding is analyzed in comparison to its optimal limits and traditional fully digital (FD) architectures, considering the effects of the Lorentzian constraints of metasurfaces and the degree of freedom (DoF) limitations due to a reduced number of RF chains. We demonstrate that the performance gap caused by DoF constraints becomes more significant as the number of users increases, highlighting the trade-offs of DMA in high-density wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Large Wireless Model (LWM): A Foundation Model for Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Large Wireless Model (LWM) -- the world's first foundation model for wireless channels. Designed as a task-agnostic model, LWM generates universal, rich, contextualized channel embeddings (features) that potentially enhance performance across a wide range of downstream tasks in wireless communication and sensing systems. Towards this objective, LWM, which has a transformer-based architecture, was pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on large-scale wireless channel datasets. Our results show consistent improvements in downstream tasks when using the LWM embeddings compared to raw channel representations, especially in scenarios with high-complexity machine learning tasks and limited training datasets. This LWM's ability to learn from large-scale wireless data opens a promising direction for intelligent systems that can efficiently adapt to diverse tasks with limited data, paving the way for addressing key challenges in wireless communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Unconnectable through Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable uplink connectivity remains a persistent challenge for IoT devices, particularly those at the cell edge, due to their limited transmit power and single-antenna configurations. This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at connecting the unconnectable, leveraging real-time feedback from access points (APs) to enhance uplink coverage without increasing the energy consumption of IoT devices. At the core of this approach are feedback channel codes, which enable IoT devices to dynamically adapt their transmission strategies based on AP decoding feedback, thereby reducing the critical uplink SNR required for successful communication. Analytical models are developed to quantify the coverage probability and the number of connectable APs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance. Numerical results validate the proposed method, demonstrating substantial improvements in coverage range and connectivity, particularly for devices at the cell edge, with up to a 51% boost in connectable APs. Our approach offers a robust and energy-efficient solution to overcoming uplink coverage limitations, enabling IoT networks to connect devices in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Multi-coding with Arbitrary Correlations Among the Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of non-orthogonal signals has several benefits over orthogonal signals in multi-coded communications. We provide a novel, theoretical study of non-orthogonal signaling to expand the applicability of these schemes. Motivated by a class of multi-carrier spread spectrum systems, this paper presents a thorough symbol error rate analysis of the broad class of multi-code signaling methods when they make use of codes which are not necessarily orthogonal. Our analysis is also extended to the case where the code set includes the negative of each code vector, i.e., an extension to biorthogonal signaling. Moreover, it is shown that the symbol error rate results derived in this paper reduce to those available in the literature when the multi-codes are orthogonal or have equal correlation between vectors. Additionally, we show how Monte Carlo integration can be used to evaluate the integrals in the error probability calculation and derive low complexity upper bounds on the error probabilities.</description>

      <title>Real-time Tracking System with Partially Coupled Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a pull-based real-time tracking system consisting of multiple partially coupled sources and a sink. The sink monitors the sources in real-time and can request one source for an update at each time instant. The sources send updates over an unreliable wireless channel. The sources are partially coupled, and updates about one source can provide partial knowledge about other sources. We study the problem of minimizing the sum of an average distortion function and a transmission cost. Since the controller is at the sink side, the controller (sink) has only partial knowledge about the source states, and thus, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and then cast it as a belief-MDP problem. Using the relative value iteration algorithm, we solve the problem and propose a control policy. Simulation results show the proposed policy's effectiveness and superiority compared to a baseline policy.</description>

      <title>Grant-Free Random Access in Uplink LEO Satellite Communications with OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint device activity detection and channel estimation for grant-free random access in Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications. We consider uplink communications from multiple single-antenna terrestrial users to a LEO satellite equipped with a uniform planar array of multiple antennas, where orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is adopted. To combat the severe Doppler shift, a transmission scheme is proposed, where the discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM) is introduced to reduce the number of unknown channel parameters. Then the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm is employed to approximate the minimum mean square error estimation of the channel, and the Markov random field is combined to capture the channel sparsity. Meanwhile, the expectation-maximization (EM) approach is integrated to learn the hyperparameters in priors. Finally, active devices are detected by calculating energy of the estimated channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of activity error rate and channel estimation precision.</description>
