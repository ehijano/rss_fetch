      <title>A Graph Neural Network Approach to Dispersed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that accurately simulates a multidisperse suspension of interacting spherical particles. Our machine learning framework is build upon the recent work of Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. ICML, PMLR, 119, 8459-8468 (2020) on graph network simulators, and efficiently learns the intricate dynamics of the interacting particles. Nodes and edges of the GNN correspond to, respectively, the particles with their individual properties/data (e.g., radius, position, velocity) and the pair interactions between the particles (e.g., electrostatics, hydrodynamics). A key contribution of our work is to account for the finite dimensions of the particles and their impact on the system dynamics. We test our GNN against an exemplary case study of a multidisperse mixture of two-dimensional spheres sedimenting under gravity in a liquid and interacting with each other by a Lennard-Jones potential. The present GNN framework offers a fast and accurate method for the theoretical study of complex physical systems such as field-induced behavior of colloidal suspensions and ionic liquids. Our implementation of the GNN is available on GitHub at github.com/rfjd/GNS-DispersedSystems.</description>

      <title>Tree Code Based Neighborhood Algorithms for Discrete Element Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our experiences for the development of a neighborhood algorithm implemented via tree-codes to optimize the performance of a discrete element method (DEM) for convex polytopes. Our implementation of the two-dimensional tree code needs $N\log N$, as does the sort and sweep approach. For our choice of boundary conditions (a rotating drum) and system sizes (up to several thousand particles), the performance of the tree-code is slightly better, but the algorithm is considerably more complicated than the sort and sweep approach.</description>

      <title>Addressing general measurements in quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving general (off-diagonal) measurements is one of the most significant challenges in quantum Monte Carlo, which strongly limits its application during the decades of development. We propose a universal scheme to tackle the problems of general measurement. The target observables are expressed as the ratio of two types of partition functions $\langle \mathrm{\hat{O}} \rangle=\bar{Z}/Z$, where $\bar{Z}=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{\hat{O}e^{-\beta H}})$ and $Z=\mathrm{tr} (\mathrm{e^{-\beta H}})$. These two partition functions can be estimated separately within the reweight-annealing frame, and then be connected by an easily solvable reference point. We have successfully applied this scheme to XXZ model and transverse field Ising model, from 1D to 2D systems, from two-body to multi-body correlations and even non-local disorder operators, and from equal-time to imaginary-time correlations. The reweighting path is not limited to physical parameters, but also works for space and (imaginary) time. Our work paves an easy and efficient way to capture the complex off-diagonal operators in quantum Monte Carlo simulation, which provides new insight to address the challenge of quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Structural and Magnetic Properties of Co-rich bct CoMn Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths leading to higher TMR effects and better MTJ devices.</description>

      <title>Learning constitutive relations from experiments: 1. PDE constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to accurately and efficiently identify the constitutive behavior of complex materials through full-field observations. We formulate the problem of inferring constitutive relations from experiments as an indirect inverse problem that is constrained by the balance laws. Specifically, we seek to find a constitutive behavior that minimizes the difference between the experimental observation and the corresponding quantities computed with the model, while enforcing the balance laws. We formulate the forward problem as a boundary value problem corresponding to the experiment, and compute the sensitivity of the objective with respect to model using the adjoint method. The resulting method is robust and can be applied to constitutive models with arbitrary complexity. We focus on elasto-viscoplasticity, but the approach can be extended to other settings. In this part one, we formulate the method and demonstrate it using synthetic data on two problems, one quasistatic and the other dynamic.</description>

      <title>Fast and stable tight-binding framework for nonlocal kinetic energy density functional reconstruction in orbital-free density functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs) with density-dependent kernels are currently the most accurate functionals available for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) calculations. However, despite advances in numerical techniques and using only (semi)local density-dependent kernels, nonlocal KEDFs still present substantial computational costs in OF-DFT, limiting their application in large-scale material simulations. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient framework for reconstructing nonlocal KEDFs by incorporating the density functional tight-binding approach, in which the energy functionals are simplified through a first-order functional expansion based on the superposition of free-atom electron densities. This strategy allows the computationally expensive nonlocal kinetic energy and potential calculations to be performed only once during the electron density optimization process, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Benchmark tests using advanced nonlocal KEDFs, such as revHC and LDAK-MGPA, on standard structures including Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Si, III-V semiconductors, as well as Mg$_{50}$ and Si$_{50}$ clusters, demonstrate that our method achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency, providing a cost-effective balance between accuracy and computational speed. Additionally, the reconstructed functionals exhibit improved numerical stability for both bulk and finite systems, paving the way for developing more sophisticated KEDFs for realistic material simulations using OF-DFT.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Tensor Network Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a powerful tool for sampling from complex probability distributions. Despite its versatility, MCMC often suffers from strong autocorrelation and the negative sign problem, leading to slowing down the convergence of statistical error. We propose a novel MCMC formulation based on tensor network representations to reduce the population variance and mitigate these issues systematically. By introducing stochastic projectors into the tensor network framework and employing Markov chain sampling, our method eliminates the systematic error associated with low-rank approximation in tensor contraction while maintaining the high accuracy of the tensor network method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the two-dimensional Ising model, achieving an exponential reduction in statistical error with increasing bond dimension cutoff. Furthermore, we address the sign problem in systems with negative weights, showing significant improvements in average signs as bond dimension cutoff increases. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for accurate statistical estimation in complex systems, paving the way for broader applications in computational physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>A deep neural network approach to solve the Dirac equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.</description>

      <title>Digital twin inference from multi-physical simulation data of DED additive manufacturing processes with neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A digital twin is a virtual representation that accurately replicates its physical counterpart, fostering bi-directional real-time data exchange throughout the entire process lifecycle. For Laser Directed Energy Deposition of Wire (DED-LB/w) additive manufacturing processes, digital twins may help to control the residual stress design in build parts. This study focuses on providing faster-than-real-time and highly accurate surrogate models for the formation of residual stresses by employing neural ordinary differential equations. The approach enables accurate prediction of temperatures and altered structural properties like stress tensor components. The developed surrogates can ultimately facilitate on-the-fly re-optimization of the ongoing manufacturing process to achieve desired structural outcomes. Consequently, this building block contributes significantly to realizing digital twins and the first-time-right paradigm in additive manufacturing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article compares the tensor method density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) with two neural network based methods -namely FermiNet and PauliNet) for determining the ground state wavefunction of the  many-body electronic Schr{\"o}dinger problem. We provide numerical simulations illustrating the main features of the methods and showing convergence with respect to some parameter, such as the rank for DMRG, and number of pretraining iterations for neural networks. We then compare the obtained energy with the methods for a few atoms and molecules, for some of which the exact value of the energy is known for the sake of comparison. In the last part of the article, we propose a new kind of neural network to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger problem based on the training of the wavefunction on a simplex, and an explicit permutation for evaluating the wavefunction on the whole space. We provide numerical results on a toy problem for the sake of illustration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of calculation of the electric field distribution in the inhomogeneous media based on the generalized WKB method. In this approach the field is represented as the sum of two components, one of which is associated with the right-travelling WKB solution and the other with the left-travelling WKB solution. It has been shown that the second component is not a left-travelling nonuniform wave. Calculation results showed that the phase distribution of this component has an increasing character, similar to the phase distribution of the right-travelling wave component. Obtained results can be useful during the development of dielectric accelerating waveguides. The obtained results may also indicate the location where a semiclassical particle with energy greater than the barrier height can reflect from a smooth potential barrier.</description>

      <title>Characterization of local energy transfer in large-scale intermittent stratified geophysical flows via space filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies based on simulations of the Boussinesq equations indicate that stratified turbulent flows can develop large-scale intermittency in the velocity and temperature fields, as detected in the atmosphere and in the oceans. In particular, emerging powerful vertical drafts were found to generate local turbulence, proving necessary for stratified flows to dissipate the energy as efficiently as homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. The existence of regions characterized by enhanced turbulence and dissipation, as observed, for instance, in the ocean, requires appropriate tools to assess how energy is transferred across the scales and at the same time locally in the physical space. After refining a classical space-filtering procedure, here we investigate the feedback of extreme vertical velocity drafts on energy transfer and exchanges in subdomains of simulations of stably stratified flows of geophysical interest. Our analysis shows that vertical drafts are indeed able to trigger upscale and downscale energy transfers, strengthening the coupling between kinetic and potential energies at certain scales, depending on the intensity of the local vertical velocity.</description>

      <title>Joint Approximate Diagonalization approach to Quasiparticle Self-Consistent $GW$ calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an alternative route to quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ calculations ($\mathrm{qs}GW$) on the basis of a Joint Approximate Diagonalization of the one-body $GW$ Green's functions $G(\varepsilon_n^{QP})$ taken at the input quasiparticle energies. Such an approach allows working with the full dynamical self-energy, without approximating the latter by a symmetrized static form as in the standard $\mathrm{qs}GW$ scheme. Calculations on the $GW$100 molecular test set lead nevertheless to a good agreement, at the 65 meV mean-absolute-error accuracy on the ionization potential, with respect to the conventional $\mathrm{qs}GW$ approach. We show further that constructing the density matrix from the full Green's function as in the fully self-consistent $\mathrm{sc}GW$ scheme, and not from the occupied quasiparticle one-body orbitals, allows obtaining a scheme intermediate between $\mathrm{qs}GW$ and $\mathrm{sc}GW$ approaches, closer to CCSD(T) reference values.</description>

      <title>A Novel and Simple Invariant-Domain-Preserving Framework for PAMPA Scheme: 1D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PAMPA (Point-Average-Moment PolynomiAl-interpreted) method, proposed in [R. Abgrall, Commun. Appl. Math. Comput., 5: 370-402, 2023], combines conservative and non-conservative formulations of hyperbolic conservation laws to evolve cell averages and point values. Solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws typically have an invariant domain, and ensuring numerical solutions stay within this domain is essential yet nontrivial. This paper presents a novel framework for designing efficient Invariant-Domain-Preserving (IDP) PAMPA schemes. We first analyze the IDP property for updated cell averages in the original PAMPA scheme, revealing the role of cell average decomposition and midpoint values in maintaining the invariant domain. This analysis highlights the difficulty of relying on continuous fluxes alone to preserve the invariant domain. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple IDP limiter for cell midpoint values, and propose a provably IDP PAMPA scheme that guarantees the preservation of the invariant domain for updated cell averages without requiring post-processing limiters. This approach contrasts with existing bound-preserving PAMPA schemes, which often require additional convex limiting to blend high-order and low-order solutions. Most notably, inspired by the Softplus and Clipped ReLU functions from machine learning, we propose an automatic IDP reformulation of the governing equations, resulting in an unconditionally limiter-free IDP scheme for evolving point values. We also introduce techniques to suppress spurious oscillations, enabling the scheme to capture strong shocks effectively. Numerical experiments on 1D problems, including the linear convection equation, Burgers equation, the compressible Euler equations, and MHD equations, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed IDP PAMPA scheme.</description>

Abstract: Atomistic simulations of properties of materials at finite temperatures are computationally demanding and require models that are more efficient than the ab initio approaches. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) address this issue by enabling accurate models with close to ab initio accuracy. Here, we demonstrate the utility of ML models in capturing properties of realistic materials by performing finite temperature molecular dynamics simulations of perovskite oxides using a force field based on equivariant graph neural networks. The models demonstrate efficient learning from a small training dataset of energies, forces, stresses, and tensors of Born effective charges. We qualitatively capture the temperature dependence of the dielectric tensor and structural phase transitions in calcium titanate.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Critical Micelle Concentration of Nonionic and Ionic Surfactants by Self-Consistent Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and understanding its relationship with both the intrinsic molecular structures and environmental conditions are crucial for the rational design of surfactants. Here, we develop a self-consistent field theory which unifies the study of CMC, micellar structure and kinetic pathway of micellization in one framework. The long-range electrostatic interactions are accurately treated, which not only makes the theory applicable to both nonionic and ionic surfactants but also enables us to capture a variety of salt effects. The effectiveness and versatility of the theory is verified by applying it to three types of commonly used surfactants. For polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers (C$_m$E$_n$) surfactants, we predict a wide span of CMC from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$M as the composition parameters $m$ and $n$ are adjusted. For the ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant, we show the decrease of CMC as salt concentration increases, and capture both the specific cation effect and the specific anion effect. Furthermore, for sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES) surfactants, we find a non-monotonic dependence of both the CMC and micelle size on the number of oxyethylene groups. Our theoretical predictions of CMC are in quantitative agreement with experimental data reported in literature for all the three types of surfactants.</description>

Abstract: Atomic heating is a fundamental phenomenon governed by the thermal spike effect during energetic deposition. This work presented another insight into thermal spike using a coupled classical oscillator model instead of a typical heat diffusion model. The temperature profile of deposited atoms was replaced by oscillator amplitude as an energy descriptor. Solving associated partial differential equations (PDEs)suggests the efficiency of energy transfer from the coupled hot to cold oscillators essentially relies on the atomic distance r and the spring constant k. The solution towards the damped wave equation further emphasize that a localized thermal fluctuation during energy propagation.</description>

      <title>Edge Dynamics in Iron-Cluster Catalyzed Growth of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations based on a Neural Network Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09264v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the high potential for applications utilizing the unique properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), there is considerable enthusiasm for addressing the challenges associated with synthesizing SWCNTs with specific chirality. To elucidate the mechanisms that determine the chirality of SWCNTs during growth, intensive efforts have been devoted to classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, the mechanism of chirality determination has not been fully clarified, which can partly be attributed to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials in reproducing the behavior of carbon and metal atoms. In this work, we develop a neural network potential (NNP) for carbon-metal system to accurately describe the SWCNT growth, and perform MD simulations of SWCNT growth using the NNP. The MD simulations illustrate the defect-free, chirality-definable growth of SWCNTs, highlighting the dynamic rearrangement of edge configurations and the consistency between the probability of edge configuration appearance and the entropy-driven edge stability model proposed here. It is also shown that the edge defect formation is induced by vacancy and suppressed by vacancy healing through adatom diffusion on the SWCNT edges. These results provide insights into the edge formation thermodynamics and kinetics of SWCNTs, an important clue to the chirality-controlled synthesis of SWCNTs.</description>

      <title>Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>

      <title>A Python-based flow solver for numerical simulations using an immersed boundary method on single GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation for running three-dimensional numerical simulations of fluid-structure interaction problems on single GPUs, based on Nvidia CUDA through Numba and Python. The incompressible flow around moving bodies is solved in this framework through an implementation of the Immersed Boundary Method tailored for the GPU, where different GPU grid architectures are exploited to optimize the overall performance. By targeting a single-GPU, we avoid GPU-CPU and GPU-GPU communication bottlenecks, since all the simulation data is always in the global memory of the GPU. We provide details about the numerical methodology, the implementation of the algorithm in the GPU and the memory management, critical in single-GPU implementations. Additionally, we verify the results comparing with our analogous CPU-based parallel solver and assess satisfactorily the efficiency of the code in terms of the relative computing time of the different operations and the scaling of the CPU code compared to a single GPU case. Overall, our tests show that the single-GPU code is between 34 to 54 times faster than the CPU solver in peak performance (96-128 CPU cores). This speedup mainly comes from the change in the method of solution of the linear systems of equations, while the speedup in sections of the algorithm that are equivalent in the CPU and GPU implementations is more modest (i.e., $\times 1.6-3$ speedup in the computation of the non-linear terms). Finally, we showcase the performance of this new GPU implementation in two applications of interest, one for external flows (i.e., bioinspired aerodynamics) and one for internal flows (i.e., cardiovascular flows), demonstrating the strong scaling of the code in two different GPU cards (hardware).%\red{for both single and double precision.}</description>

      <title>Validation of the static forward Grad-Shafranov equilibrium solvers in FreeGSNKE and Fiesta using EFIT++ reconstructions from MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12432v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key aspect in the modelling of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria in tokamak devices is having access to fast, accurate, and stable numerical simulation methods. There is an increasing demand for reliable methods that can be used to develop traditional or machine learning-based shape control feedback systems, optimise scenario designs, and integrate with other plasma edge or transport modelling codes. To handle such applications, these codes need to be flexible and, more importantly, they need to have been validated against both analytically known and real-world tokamak equilibria to ensure they are consistent and credible. In this paper, we are interested in solving the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem for free-boundary MHD equilibria. Our focus is on the validation of the static forward solver in the Python-based equilibrium code FreeGSNKE by solving equilibria from magnetics-only EFIT++ reconstructions of MAST-U shots. In addition, we also validate FreeGSNKE against equilibria simulated using the well-established MATLAB-based equilibrium code Fiesta. To do this, we develop a computational pipeline that allows one to load the same (a)symmetric MAST-U machine description into each solver, specify the required inputs (active/passive conductor currents, plasma profiles and coefficients, etc.) from EFIT++, and solve the GS equation for all available time slices across a shot. For a number of different MAST-U shots, we demonstrate that both FreeGSNKE and Fiesta can successfully reproduce various poloidal flux quantities and shape targets (e.g. midplane radii, magnetic axes, separatrices, X-points, and strikepoints) in agreement with EFIT++ calculations to a very high degree of accuracy. We also provide public access to the code/data required to load the MAST-U machine description in FreeGSNKE/Fiesta and reproduce the equilibria in the shots shown.</description>

      <title>Phase field simulations of thermal annealing for all-small molecule organic solar cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interest in organic solar cells (OSCs) is constantly rising in the field of photovoltaic devices. The device performance relies on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) nanomorphology, which develops during the drying process and additional post-treatment. This work studies the effect of thermal annealing (TA) on an all-small molecule DRCN5T: PC71 BM blend with phase field simulations. The objective is to determine the physical phenomena driving the evolution of the BHJ morphology for a better understanding of the posttreatment/morphology relationship. Phase-field simulation results are used to investigate the impact on the final BHJ morphology of the DRCN5T crystallization-related mechanisms, including nucleation, growth, crystal stability, impingement, grain coarsening, and Ostwald ripening, of the amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS), and of diffusion limitations. The comparison of simulation results with experimental data shows that the morphological evolution of the BHJ under TA is dominated by dissolution of the smallest, unstable DRCN5T crystals and anisotropic growth of the largest crystals.</description>

      <title>Scalable learning of potentials to predict time-dependent Hartree-Fock dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to learn the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) inter-electronic potential of a molecule from its electron density dynamics. Though the entire TDHF Hamiltonian, including the inter-electronic potential, can be computed from first principles, we use this problem as a testbed to develop strategies that can be applied to learn a priori unknown terms that arise in other methods/approaches to quantum dynamics, e.g., emerging problems such as learning exchange-correlation potentials for time-dependent density functional theory. We develop, train, and test three models of the TDHF inter-electronic potential, each parameterized by a four-index tensor of size up to $60 \times 60 \times 60 \times 60$. Two of the models preserve Hermitian symmetry, while one model preserves an eight-fold permutation symmetry that implies Hermitian symmetry. Across seven different molecular systems, we find that accounting for the deeper eight-fold symmetry leads to the best-performing model across three metrics: training efficiency, test set predictive power, and direct comparison of true and learned inter-electronic potentials. All three models, when trained on ensembles of field-free trajectories, generate accurate electron dynamics predictions even in a field-on regime that lies outside the training set. To enable our models to scale to large molecular systems, we derive expressions for Jacobian-vector products that enable iterative, matrix-free training.</description>

      <title>Symmetry based efficient simulation of dissipative quantum many-body dynamics in subwavelength quantum emitter arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method to numerically simulate the dissipative dynamics of large numbers of quantum emitters in ordered arrays in the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the vacuum electromagnetic field. Using the spatial symmetries of the system, we rewrite the equations of motion in a collective spin basis and subsequently apply a higher-order cumulant expansion for the collective operators. By truncating the subradiant collective modes with a heavily suppressed decay rate and keeping only the effect from the radiating collective modes, we reduce the numerical complexity significantly. This allows to efficiently compute the dissipative dynamics of the observables of interest for a linear, ring-shaped and planar arrays of quantum emitters. In particular, we characterize the excited population, the total photon emission rate and the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau =0)$, which are challenging to compute for large systems with traditional cumulant expansion methods based on the individual spins.</description>

      <title>Utilizing a machine-learned potential to explore enhanced radiation tolerance in the MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) based on tungsten (W) have emerged as promising candidates for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors, owing to their excellent irradiation resistance. In this study, we construct an efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the MoNbTaVW quinary system. This potential achieves computational speeds comparable to the embedded-atom method (EAM) potential, allowing us to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the primary radiation damage through molecular dynamics simulations. Threshold displacement energies (TDEs) in the MoNbTaVW HEA are investigated and compared with pure metals. A series of displacement cascade simulations at primary knock-on atom energies ranging from 10 to 150 keV reveal significant differences in defect generation and clustering between MoNbTaVW HEA and pure W. In HEAs, we observe more surviving Frenkel pairs (FPs) but fewer and smaller interstitial clusters compared to W, indicating superior radiation tolerance. We propose extended damage models to quantify the radiation dose in the MoNbTaVW HEA, and suggest that one reason for their enhanced resistance is subcascade splitting, which reduces the formation of interstitial clusters. Our findings provide critical insights into the fundamental irradiation resistance mechanisms in refractory body-centered cubic alloys, offering guidance for the design of future radiation-tolerant materials.</description>

      <title>Re-anchoring Quantum Monte Carlo with Tensor-Train Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, having a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for avoiding sign problems. Typically, this trial wavefunction is fixed throughout the simulation. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems, achieving a relative error of \(10^{-5}\) in estimating ground-state energies. Additionally, the overlap between our estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction achieves a high-fidelity. We provide a convergence proof, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimate.</description>
