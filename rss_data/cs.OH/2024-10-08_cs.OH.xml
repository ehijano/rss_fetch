      <title>Electrification of Transportation: A Hybrid Benders/SDDP Algorithm for Optimal Charging Station Trading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the electrification of transportation as a response to environmental challenges caused by fossil fuels, exploring the potential of battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as alternative solutions. However, a significant barrier to their widespread adoption is the limited availability of charging infrastructure. Therefore, this study proposes the development of comprehensive charging stations capable of accommodating both battery and hydrogen vehicles to address this challenge. The energy is purchased from the day-ahead and intraday auction-based electricity markets, where the electricity price is subject to uncertainty. Therefore, a two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated while the price scenarios are generated utilizing a k-means clustering algorithm. Given the complexity of the proposed model, an efficient solution approach is developed through the hybridization of the Benders decomposition algorithm and stochastic dual dynamic programming. In the Benders master problem, day-ahead bidding variables are determined, whereas the Benders sub-problem addresses intraday bidding and charging station scheduling variables, employing stochastic dual dynamic programming to tackle its intractability. Additionally, we transform the mixed integer linear program model of the second stage problem into a linear program, confirming its validity through KKT conditions. Our model provides practical insights for making informed decisions in electricity markets based on sequential auctions. While the bidding curves submitted to the day-ahead market remain unaffected by scenarios, those submitted to the intra-day market show dependence on fluctuations in day-ahead market prices.</description>
