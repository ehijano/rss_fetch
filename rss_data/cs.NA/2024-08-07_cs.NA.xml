      <title>Error analysis of an L2-type method on graded meshes for semilinear subdiffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semilinear initial-boundary value problem with a Caputo time derivative of fractional order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ is considered, solutions of which typically exhibit a singular behaviour at an initial time. For an L2-type discretization of order $3-\alpha$, we give sharp pointwise-in-time error bounds on graded temporal meshes with arbitrary degree of grading.</description>

      <title>Bayesian learning with Gaussian processes for low-dimensional representations of time-dependent nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a data-driven method for learning low-dimensional time-dependent physics-based surrogate models whose predictions are endowed with uncertainty estimates. We use the operator inference approach to model reduction that poses the problem of learning low-dimensional model terms as a regression of state space data and corresponding time derivatives by minimizing the residual of reduced system equations. Standard operator inference models perform well with accurate training data that are dense in time, but producing stable and accurate models when the state data are noisy and/or sparse in time remains a challenge. Another challenge is the lack of uncertainty estimation for the predictions from the operator inference models. Our approach addresses these challenges by incorporating Gaussian process surrogates into the operator inference framework to (1) probabilistically describe uncertainties in the state predictions and (2) procure analytical time derivative estimates with quantified uncertainties. The formulation leads to a generalized least-squares regression and, ultimately, reduced-order models that are described probabilistically with a closed-form expression for the posterior distribution of the operators. The resulting probabilistic surrogate model propagates uncertainties from the observed state data to reduced-order predictions. We demonstrate the method is effective for constructing low-dimensional models of two nonlinear partial differential equations representing a compressible flow and a nonlinear diffusion-reaction process, as well as for estimating the parameters of a low-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing compartmental models in epidemiology.</description>

      <title>High-order Tensor-Train Finite Volume Method for Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a high-order tensor-train (TT) finite volume method for the Shallow Water Equations (SWEs). We present the implementation of the $3^{rd}$ order Upwind and the $5^{th}$ order Upwind and WENO reconstruction schemes in the TT format. It is shown in detail that the linear upwind schemes can be implemented by directly manipulating the TT cores while the WENO scheme requires the use of TT cross interpolation for the nonlinear reconstruction. In the development of numerical fluxes, we directly compute the flux for the linear SWEs without using TT rounding or cross interpolation. For the nonlinear SWEs where the TT reciprocal of the shallow water layer thickness is needed for fluxes, we develop an approximation algorithm using Taylor series to compute the TT reciprocal. The performance of the TT finite volume solver with linear and nonlinear reconstruction options is investigated under a physically relevant set of validation problems. In all test cases, the TT finite volume method maintains the formal high-order accuracy of the corresponding traditional finite volume method. In terms of speed, the TT solver achieves up to 124x acceleration of the traditional full-tensor scheme.</description>

      <title>A three-stage method for reconstructing multiple coefficients in coupled photoacoustic and diffuse optical imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography with additional optical current data supplemented from diffuse optical tomography. We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen coefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.</description>

      <title>Fast Partial Fourier Transforms for Large-Scale Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography is a popular imaging technique that combines diffractive imaging with scanning microscopy. The technique consists of a coherent beam that is scanned across an object in a series of overlapping positions, leading to reliable and improved reconstructions. Ptychographic microscopes allow for large fields to be imaged at high resolution at additional computational expense. In this work, we explore the use of the fast Partial Fourier Transforms (PFTs), which efficiently compute Fourier coefficients corresponding to low frequencies. The core idea is to use the PFT in a plug-and-play manner to warm-start existing ptychography algorithms such as the ptychographic iterative engine (PIE). This approach reduces the computational budget required to solve the ptychography problem. Our numerical results show that our scheme accelerates the convergence of traditional solvers without sacrificing quality of reconstruction.</description>

      <title>NeurAM: nonlinear dimensionality reduction for uncertainty quantification through neural active manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, specifically designed for computationally expensive mathematical models. We leverage autoencoders to discover a one-dimensional neural active manifold (NeurAM) capturing the model output variability, plus a simultaneously learnt surrogate model with inputs on this manifold. The proposed dimensionality reduction framework can then be applied to perform outer loop many-query tasks, like sensitivity analysis and uncertainty propagation. In particular, we prove, both theoretically under idealized conditions, and numerically in challenging test cases, how NeurAM can be used to obtain multifidelity sampling estimators with reduced variance by sampling the models on the discovered low-dimensional and shared manifold among models. Several numerical examples illustrate the main features of the proposed dimensionality reduction strategy, and highlight its advantages with respect to existing approaches in the literature.</description>

      <title>An efficient preconditioner for evolutionary partial differential equations with $\theta$-method in time discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the $\theta$-method is used for discretizing a class of evolutionary partial differential equations. Then, we transform the resultant all-at-once linear system and introduce a novel one-sided preconditioner, which can be fast implemented in a parallel-in-time way. By introducing an auxiliary two-sided preconditioned system, we provide theoretical insights into the relationship between the residuals of the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method when applied to both one-sided and two-sided preconditioned systems. Moreover, we show that the condition number of the two-sided preconditioned matrix is uniformly bounded by a constant that is independent of the matrix size, which in turn implies that the convergence behavior of the GMRES method for the one-sided preconditioned system is guaranteed. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency and robustness of the proposed preconditioning approach.</description>

      <title>FIAT: improving performance and accuracy for high-order finite elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FIAT (the FInite element Automatic Tabulator) provides a powerful Python library for the generation and evaluation of finite element basis functions on a reference element. This release paper describes recent improvements to FIAT aimed at improving its run time and the accuracy and efficiency of code generated using FIAT-provided information. In the first category, we have greatly streamlined the implementation of orthogonal polynomials out of which finite element bases are built. The second category comprises several more advances. For one, we have built an interface to the $\texttt{recursivenodes}$ package to enable more accurate Lagrange bases at high order. We have also implemented integral-type degrees of freedom for $H(\mathrm{div})$ and $H(\mathrm{curl})$ elements, which match the mathematical definitions of the elements more closely and also avoid loss of accuracy in interpolation. More fundamentally, we have included families of simplicial quadrature rules that require many fewer quadrature points than the Stroud rules previously used in FIAT. Finally, FIAT now provides support for fast diagonalization methods, which enable fast solution algorithms at very high order. In each case, we describe the new features in FIAT and illustrate some of the gains obtained through simple numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Coarse Spaces Based on Higher-Order Interpolation for Schwarz Preconditioners for Helmholtz Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of scalable and wavenumber-robust iterative solvers for Helmholtz problems is challenging but also relevant for various application fields. In this work, two-level Schwarz domain decomposition preconditioners are enhanced by coarse space constructed using higher-order B\'ezier interpolation. The numerical results indicate numerical scalability and robustness with respect the wavenumber, as long as the wavenumber times the element size of the coarse mesh is sufficiently low.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the acoustic Green`s function for a half-space impedance problem in arbitrary spatial dimension d can be written as a sum of two terms, each of which is the product of an exponential function with the eikonal in the argument and a slowly varying function. We introduce the notion of families of slowly varying functions to formulate this statement as a theorem and present its proof.</description>

      <title>An AI-aided algorithm for multivariate polynomial reconstruction on Cartesian grids and the PLG finite difference method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial reconstruction on Cartesian grids is a key problem in developing finite difference methods as well as in many other engineering applications, yet it is still an open problem how to construct for a finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{Z}^{\textsf{D}}$ a lattice $\mathcal{T}\subset K$ so that multivariate polynomial interpolation on this lattice is unisolvent. In this work, we solve this open problem of poised lattice generation (PLG) via an interdisciplinary research of approximation theory, abstract algebra, and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, we focus on the triangular lattices in approximation theory, study group actions of permutations upon triangular lattices, prove an isomorphism between the group of permutations and that of triangular lattices, and dynamically organize the AI state space of permutations so that a depth-first search of poised lattices has optimal efficiency. Based on this algorithm, we further develop the PLG finite difference method that retains the simplicity of Cartesian grids yet overcomes the disadvantage of legacy finite difference methods in handling irregular geometries. Results of various numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and the simplicity, efficiency, and fourth-order accuracy of the PLG finite difference method.</description>

      <title>A direct reconstruction method for radiating sources in Maxwell's equations with single-frequency data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and robust numerical method for reconstructing point-like sources in the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations given Cauchy data at a fixed frequency. This is an electromagnetic inverse source problem with broad applications, such as antenna synthesis and design, medical imaging, and pollution source tracing. We introduce new imaging functions and a computational algorithm to determine the number of point sources, their locations, and associated moment vectors, even when these vectors have notably different magnitudes. The number of sources and locations are estimated using significant peaks of the imaging functions, and the moment vectors are computed via explicitly simple formulas. The theoretical analysis and stability of the imaging functions are investigated, where the main challenge lies in analyzing the behavior of the dot products between the columns of the imaginary part of the Green's tensor and the unknown moment vectors. Additionally, we extend our method to reconstruct small-volume sources using an asymptotic expansion of their radiated electric field. We provide numerical examples in three dimensions to demonstrate the performance of our method.</description>

      <title>A first-order hyperbolic reformulation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new first-order hyperbolic reformulation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation. The model is obtained from the combination of augmented Lagrangian techniques proposed earlier by the authors of this paper, with a classical Cattaneo-type relaxation that allows to reformulate diffusion equations as augmented first order hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation source terms. The proposed system is proven to be hyperbolic and to admit a Lyapunov functional, in accordance with the original equations. A new numerical scheme is proposed to solve the original Cahn-Hilliard equations based on conservative semi-implicit finite differences, while the hyperbolic system was numerically solved by means of a classical second order MUSCL-Hancock-type finite volume scheme. The proposed approach is validated through a set of classical benchmarks such as spinodal decomposition, Ostwald ripening and exact stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>Activations Through Extensions: A Framework To Boost Performance Of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activation functions are non-linearities in neural networks that allow them to learn complex mapping between inputs and outputs. Typical choices for activation functions are ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid etc., where the choice generally depends on the application domain. In this work, we propose a framework/strategy that unifies several works on activation functions and theoretically explains the performance benefits of these works. We also propose novel techniques that originate from the framework and allow us to obtain ``extensions'' (i.e. special generalizations of a given neural network) of neural networks through operations on activation functions. We theoretically and empirically show that ``extensions'' of neural networks have performance benefits compared to vanilla neural networks with insignificant space and time complexity costs on standard test functions. We also show the benefits of neural network ``extensions'' in the time-series domain on real-world datasets.</description>

Abstract: We consider reflectionless wave propagation in networks modeled in terms of the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NNLS) equation on metric graphs, for which transparent boundary conditions are imposed at the vertices. By employing the ``potential approach" previously used for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, we derive transparent boundary conditions for the NNLS equation on metric graphs. These conditions eliminate backscattering at graph vertices, which is crucial for minimizing losses in signal, heat, and charge transfer in various applications such as optical fibers, optoelectronic networks, and low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Multigrid Monte Carlo Revisited: Theory and Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian random fields play an important role in many areas of science and engineering. In practice, they are often simulated by sampling from a high-dimensional multivariate normal distribution, which arises from the discretisation of a suitable precision operator. Existing methods such as Cholesky factorization and Gibbs sampling become prohibitively expensive on fine meshes due to their high computational cost. In this work, we revisit the Multigrid Monte Carlo (MGMC) algorithm developed by Goodman &amp; Sokal (Physical Review D 40.6, 1989) in the quantum physics context. To show that MGMC can overcome these issues, we establish a grid-size-independent convergence theory based on the link between linear solvers and samplers for multivariate normal distributions, drawing on standard multigrid convergence theory. We then apply this theory to linear Bayesian inverse problems. This application is achieved by extending the standard multigrid theory to operators with a low-rank perturbation. Moreover, we develop a novel bespoke random smoother which takes care of the low-rank updates that arise in constructing posterior moments. In particular, we prove that Multigrid Monte Carlo is algorithmically optimal in the limit of the grid-size going to zero. Numerical results support our theory, demonstrating that Multigrid Monte Carlo can be significantly more efficient than alternative methods when applied in a Bayesian setting.</description>

Abstract: We consider divergence-based high order discretizations of an $L^2$-based first order system least squares formulation of a second order elliptic equation with Robin boundary conditions. For smooth geometries, we show optimal convergence rates in the $L^2(\Omega)$ norm for the scalar variable. Convergence rates for the $L^2(\Omega)$-norm error of the gradient of the scalar variable as well as vectorial variable are also derived. Numerical examples illustrate the analysis.</description>

Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations, a model for weakly dispersive free-surface waves. We consider both the classical form, requiring the inversion of a non-linear elliptic operator, and a hyperbolic approximation of the equations, allowing fully explicit time stepping. Systems for both flat and variable topography are studied. Our novel numerical methods conserve both the total water mass and the total energy. In addition, the methods for the original Serre-Green-Naghdi equations conserve the total momentum for flat bathymetry. For variable topography, all the methods proposed are well-balanced for the lake-at-rest state. We provide a theoretical setting allowing us to construct schemes of any kind (finite difference, finite element, discontinuous Galerkin, spectral, etc.) as long as summation-by-parts operators are available in the chosen setting. Energy-stable variants are proposed by adding a consistent high-order artificial viscosity term. The proposed methods are validated through a large set of benchmarks to verify all the theoretical properties. Whenever possible, comparisons with exact, reference numerical, or experimental data are carried out. The impressive advantage of structure preservation, and in particular energy preservation, to resolve accurately dispersive wave propagation on very coarse meshes is demonstrated by several of the tests.</description>

Abstract: Classical-quantum hybrid algorithms have recently garnered significant attention, which are characterized by combining quantum and classical computing protocols to obtain readout from quantum circuits of interest. Recent progress due to Lubasch et al in a 2019 paper provides readout for solutions to the Schrodinger and Inviscid Burgers equations, by making use of a new variational quantum algorithm (VQA) which determines the ground state of a cost function expressed with a superposition of expectation values and variational parameters. In the following, we analyze additional computational prospects in which the VQA can reliably produce solutions to other PDEs that are comparable to solutions that have been previously realized classically, which are characterized with noiseless quantum simulations. To determine the range of nonlinearities that the algorithm can process for other IVPs, we study several PDEs, first beginning with the Navier-Stokes equations and progressing to other equations underlying physical phenomena ranging from electromagnetism, gravitation, and wave propagation, from simulations of the Einstein, Boussniesq-type, Lin-Tsien, Camassa-Holm, Drinfeld-Sokolov-Wilson (DSW), and Hunter-Saxton equations. To formulate optimization routines that the VQA undergoes for numerical approximations of solutions that are obtained as readout from quantum circuits, cost functions corresponding to each PDE are provided in the supplementary section after which simulations results from hundreds of ZGR-QFT ansatzae are generated.</description>

      <title>Improved Monte Carlo tree search formulation with multiple root nodes for discrete sizing optimization of truss structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using improved Monte Carlo tree search (IMCTS) formulation for discrete optimum design of truss structures. IMCTS with multiple root nodes includes update process, the best reward, accelerating technique, and terminal condition. Update process means that once a final solution is found, it is used as the initial solution for next search tree. The best reward is used in the backpropagation step. Accelerating technique is introduced by decreasing the width of search tree and reducing maximum number of iterations. The agent is trained to minimize the total structural weight under various constraints until the terminal condition is satisfied. Then, optimal solution is the minimum value of all solutions found by search trees. These numerical examples show that the agent can find optimal solution with low computational cost, stably produces an optimal design, and is suitable for multi-objective structural optimization and large-scale structures.</description>

      <title>On Properties of Adjoint Systems for Evolutionary PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric structure of adjoint systems associated with evolutionary partial differential equations at the fully continuous, semi-discrete, and fully discrete levels and the relations between these levels. We show that the adjoint system associated with an evolutionary partial differential equation has an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian structure, which is useful for connecting the fully continuous, semi-discrete, and fully discrete levels. We subsequently address the question of discretize-then-optimize versus optimize-then-discrete for both semi-discretization and time integration, by characterizing the commutativity of discretize-then-optimize methods versus optimize-then-discretize methods uniquely in terms of an adjoint-variational quadratic conservation law. For Galerkin semi-discretizations and one-step time integration methods in particular, we explicitly construct these commuting methods by using structure-preserving discretization techniques.</description>
