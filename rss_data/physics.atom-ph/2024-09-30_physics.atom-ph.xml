      <title>Energy Levels and Transition Rates of Laser-Cooling Candidate Th^-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy levels and transition rates of promising laser-cooling candidate thorium anion Th^- have been experimentally obtained in the current work. Three new excited states between the bound-bound electric dipole (E1) transition of Th^- are observed now, and their energy levels are determined to be 1,847(13), 3,166.8(59) and 3,666(12) cm^{-1}, respectively. Meanwhile, the lifetime of the upper state of that E1 transition is experimentally determined to be 30(2) microseconds, about 3 times shorter than the previous calculated result 86 microseconds, which makes Th^- the most promising candidate for laser cooling of negative ions. Furthermore, the lifetimes of two other short-lived odd-parity excited states of Th^- are also measured to be 59(4) and 53(3)microseconds, respectively.</description>

      <title>Rydberg-atom manipulation through strong interaction with free electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically trapped Rydberg atoms are a suitable platform to explore quantum many-body physics mediated by long-range atom--atom interactions that can be engineered through externally applied light fields. However, this approach is limited to dipole-allowed transitions and a spatial resolution of the order of the optical wavelength. Here, we theoretically investigate the interaction between free electrons and individual Rydberg atoms as an approach to induce nondipolar transitions with subnanometer spatial precision and a substantial degree of control over the final atomic states. We observe unity-order excitation probabilities produced by a single electron for suitably chosen combinations of electron energies and electron-beam distance to the atom. We further discuss electron--atom entanglement in combination with lateral shaping of the electron followed by postselection. Our results support free electrons as powerful tools to manipulate Rydberg atoms in previously inaccessible ways.</description>

      <title>Reexamination of vacuum-polarization corrections to the self-energy in muonic bound systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In muonic bound systems, the dominant radiative correction is due to vacuum polarization. Yet, for the interpretation of precision experiments, self-energy effects are also important. In turn, additional vacuum-polarization loops perturb the self-energy. Here, we show that combined self-energy vacuum-polarization effects can perturb the bound-state self-energy at the percent level in one-muon bound systems with nuclear charges Z = 1-6. We also update previous treatments of the corrections for muonic hydrogen, muonic deuterium, and muonic helium bound systems.</description>

      <title>Interference of photons from independent hot atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the interference of photons scattered from independent ensembles of warm atoms in atomic vapor. It employs finite temporal coherence of light scattered elastically in the forward and backward directions from Doppler-broadened atomic ensembles, such that photons with chaotic photon statistics from two opposite atomic velocity groups contribute to the same detection mode. While the random phase fluctuations of the scattered light caused by a large thermal motion prevent direct observability of the interference in the detected photon rate, the stable frequency difference between photons collected from scattering off counter-propagating laser beams provides strong periodic modulation of the photon coincidence rate with the period given by the detuning of the excitation laser from the atomic resonance. Presented interferometry promises direct applications in Doppler-free atomic and molecular spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Minimising Interference in Low-Pressure Supersonic Beam Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-jet atomic, cluster &amp; molecular sources are used to produce beams of low-energy, neutral particles and find application in a wide array of technologies, from neutral atom microscopes to instruments for surface processing. However, understanding and maximising the intensity derived from such sources has proven challenging, partly because of the interference of gas in the vacuum chamber with the beam. Here, we describe a semi-analytic method to estimate the resulting attenuation in low-pressure free-jet sources. We explicitly calculate the two contributions to the interference, which arise from the interaction of the beam with (i) background gas and (ii) atoms backscattered from the 'skimmer', a conical aperture designed to extract the centre of the expansion. We demonstrate that at high stagnation temperatures the former dominates, suggesting that the design of the skimmer has an insignificant impact at around room temperature. We also determine a number of scaling relationships and analytic formulae to make it easier to include 'skimmer interference' in future calculations of the centre-line intensity. We present experimental evidence to support our approach. Finally, we apply the theory to develop a number of design recommendations for the skimmer and vacuum chamber to enhance desirable beam properties for spectroscopy and microscopy when using cryogenic-temperature atom or molecular beams.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic recombination data for astrophysical applications: Plasma rate-coefficients for Fe^q+ (q=7-10, 13-22) and Ni^25+ ions from storage-ring experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3678</link>
      <description>arXiv:1002.3678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review summarizes the present status of an ongoing experimental effort to provide reliable rate coefficients for dielectronic recombination of highly charged iron ions for the modeling of astrophysical and other plasmas. The experimental work has been carried out over more than a decade at the heavy-ion storage-ring TSR of the Max-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. The experimental and data reduction procedures are outlined. The role of previously disregarded processes such as fine-structure core excitations and trielectronic recombination is highlighted. Plasma rate coefficients for dielectronic recombination of Fe$^{q+}$ ions (q=7-10, 13-22) and Ni$^{25+}$ are presented graphically and in a simple parameterized form allowing for easy use in plasma modeling codes. It is concluded that storage-ring experiments are presently the only source for reliable low-temperature dielectronic recombination rate-coefficients of complex ions.</description>

      <title>Limit on spatial quantum superpositions with massive objects due to phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing goal to bring massive objects into a superposition of different locations in real space, not only to confirm quantum theory in new regimes, but also to explore the interface with gravity. The main challenge is usually thought to arise from forces or scattering due to environmental fields and particles that decohere the large object's wave function into a statistical mixture. We unveil a decoherence channel which cannot be eliminated by improved isolation from the environment. It originates from sound waves within the object, which are excited as part of any splitting process and carry partial "Welcher Weg" information. This puts stringent constraints on future spatial superpositions of large objects.</description>
