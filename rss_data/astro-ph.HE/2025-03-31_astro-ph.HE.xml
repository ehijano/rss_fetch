      <title>Supermassive Black Holes in X-rays: From Standard Accretion to Extreme Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-rays are a critical wavelength for understanding supermassive black holes (SMBHs). X-rays probe the inner accretion flow, closest to the event horizon, where gas inspirals, releasing energy and driving black hole growth. This region also governs the launching of outflows and jets that regulate galaxy evolution and link SMBH growth to their host galaxies.
  This review focuses on X-ray observations of SMBHs, through "standard accretion" in persistent Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and in extreme transient events, such as Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN), and Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs). We describe the X-ray spectral and variability properties of AGN, and the observational techniques that probe the inner accretion flow. Through understanding the phenomenology and accretion physics in standard, individual AGN, we can better search for more exotic phenomenon, including binary SMBH mergers, or Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs).
  In this review, the reader will discover:
  (1) X-ray variability on timescales from minutes to hours traces accretion near the event horizon.
  (2) X-rays can measure the black hole mass, spin and accretion flow geometry and dynamics.
  (3) In transients like TDEs, X-rays probe the newly formed accretion disk that feeds the black hole.
  (4) QPEs are posited to be EMRIs orbiting accreting SMBHs that would emit low-frequency gravitational waves.
  (5) Future X-ray, time-domain and multi-messenger surveys will revolutionize our understanding of SMBH growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study line driven stellar winds using multifrequency, time-dependent radiation hydrodynamics. We compute the radiation force due to lines, the so called force multiplier, using precomputed photoionization tables and a time-dependent, local SED using a three band approximation within the hydro. We find that accounting for changes in the local SED changes the global properties of the flow. This is due to a combination of a change in the available momentum in the radiation field but also due to changes in the gas/radiation coupling mediated by the force multiplier. The acceleration can be suppressed, due to attenuation of UV flux but the force multiplier itself can be enhanced due to the overall SED hardening. We do not see evidence of a changing SED leading to formation or growth of azimuthal instabilities, as this effect appears subdominant to other instabilities in the wind. The computational methods presented can be extended to other outflow problems, notably multi-temperature disc winds and shocking in Wolf-Rayet stars.</description>

      <title>Constraining the redshift of PG 1553+113 using the photohadronic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between 2005 and 2015, the BL Lacertae object PG 1553+113 exhibited multiple very high-energy (VHE; &gt; 100 GeV) gamma-ray flares, which were detected by the Cherenkov telescopes, High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS), Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC), and the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). Despite the uncertainty surrounding its redshift (z), various studies have sought to estimate this value. In this study, seventeen independently observed VHE gamma-ray spectra of PG 1553+113 are analyzed using four distinct extragalactic background light (EBL) models alongside the photohadronic framework. A global $\chi^2$ fit is applied to all observational data to determine the best-fitting redshift for each EBL model. Additionally, confidence level (CL) intervals for the redshift are calculated across all EBL models. The findings demonstrate that the photohadronic framework effectively describes all observed spectra. Among the EBL models, the lowest total $\chi^2$ value of 58.82 (with 58 degrees of freedom) was obtained using the model from Saldana-Lopez et al. (2021), while the highest value of 75.67 was associated with the model from Dominguez et al. (2011). The 95 per cent CL intervals for the statistical error of the redshift of PG 1553+113 are 0.500 &lt; z &lt; 0.537 for the Saldana-Lopez et al. (2021) model and 0.491 &lt; z &lt; 0.527 for the Dominguez et al. (2011) model. These results highlight the consistency of the photohadronic approach in interpreting the observed VHE gamma-ray spectra.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrino Emission from a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow with a three-dimensional GRMHD Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-energy particle production in the accretion flow onto black holes can be a key physics to explain the high-energy neutrino background. While the single-zone approximation has been commonly adopted in studies of the high-energy neutrino emission around black holes, the effects of the global plasma structure may be non-negligible. We carry out the first computations of cosmic-ray acceleration and high-energy neutrino emission via the hadronuclear ($pp$) interaction in global radiatively inefficient accretion flows and outflows around a supermassive black hole, using three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation data. The Fokker-Planck equation for cosmic-ray protons is solved with a phenomenological model for the energy diffusion coefficient to express the turbulent acceleration in the sub-grid scale. The inhomogeneous and time variable structure of the accretion flow leads to a variety of particle energy distribution. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of neutrinos emitted from the entire region are flatter than those calculated under the single-zone approximation. In our model, the neutrino emission originating from cosmic rays advected with the outflow rather than the inflow predominates the SEDs. Such galactic nuclei can be significant sources of cosmic rays in those galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic One-Eyed Smile: Revealing the Hidden Face of Mike Wazowski</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel and somewhat whimsical approach to pulsar hotspot modeling by drawing inspiration from the iconic one-eyed monster, Mike Wazowski, from \emph{Monsters, Inc.}. Utilizing X-ray high-quality timing data from NICER, we apply a Bayesian inference framework to model the X-ray pulse profile of PSR J0437--4715. Our analysis employs a \emph{Wazowski Configuration} (WC) in which the conventional hotspot parametrization is replaced with a predefined image template, whose redness and size are adjusted to mimic temperature variations. The results reveal a configuration where two hotspots--one brighter and smaller in the north represents the energetic ``University time Wazowski", and one larger yet cooler in the south represents the ``Monster, Inc. time Wazowski"--combine to produce the observed X-ray pulse profile. These findings not only demonstrate the sensitivity of pulse profile modeling to hotspot morphology but also open up the intriguing possibility that the X-ray emission of some pulsars may be interpreted as a cosmic homage to our favorite animated character.</description>

      <title>Sub-parsec precision measurement of pulsar distances with nanohertz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent evidence of nanohertz (nHz) gravitational wave (GW) background by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has sparked considerable interest in understanding its astrophysical origins, particularly regarding supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we focus on individual SMBHBs that will be hopefully detected in upcoming PTA observations. The effect of nHz GWs on the pulse arriving times is in general decomposed as a pulsar term and an Earth term, where the pulsar term encodes the pulsar-Earth distance as a phase shift relative to the Earth term, but is usually treated as an extra noise source since the pulsar distance is in general not well measured with uncertainty larger than the wavelength of nHz GWs. We propose that the pulsar distance could be constrained by combining the phase information of multiple SMBHBs that are individually resolved. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, we demonstrate that the pulsar distances can be measured to better than $0.4$ pc (1 pc) for pulsars at $D\sim 1$ kpc ($\sim 2.2$ kpc) with 30 years of observations by a 20-pulsar PTA with a noise level of $\sigma_{\rm n}=20$ ns in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Phase Transition from Binary Neutron Star Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron-star mergers offer crucial insights into the matter properties of neutron stars. We present direct evidence of phase transition on the observational signatures from such events. Our study employs a range of equations of states with hadron-quark phase transition surveying from Maxwell construction smoothened up to the Gibbs construction using a control parameter $\Delta p$. This smoothening parameter allows us to explore different mixed phases and analyse their direct impact on merger dynamics. Post-merger gravitational wave emissions reveal the expression of specific signatures in the spectogram and power spectral density, serving as a distinct signature of equations of state with mixed phases. We found additional peaks in power spectral density that were fully responsible from the post-merger remnant experiencing a phase transition. Alongside this signature, the nature of phase transition transition leaves specific imprints on the spectrogram, leading to a two-folded signature from gravitational wave analysis. Furthermore, we establish a direct correlation between our findings and the threshold mass for prompt collapse. Our analysis also provides key evidence against a Maxwell-type phase transition for GW170817 if the post-merger is believed to have experienced a prompt collapse into a black hole. We show that $\Delta p \gtrsim 0.04$ is required for such a scenario. Effects of $\Delta p$ have also been observed on the ejecta mass from the event, which can affect the kilonova afterglow.</description>

      <title>Infant Core-collapse Supernovae with Circumstellar Interactions from KMTNet I: Luminous Transitional Case of KSP-SN-2022c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $BVi$ multi-band high-cadence observations of a Type II supernova (SN) KSP-SN-2022c from a star-forming galaxy at $z$ $\simeq$ 0.041 from its infant to nebular phase. Early light curve fitting with a single power-law is consistent with the first detection of roughly 15 minutes after shock breakout. The SN light curves feature a rapid rise and decline across its luminous ($V$ $\simeq$ -18.41 mag) peak together with a short plateau. The presence of the short plateau and rapid post-peak decline place the SN within a small group of transitional type between Type II-P and II-L subtypes. Its (i) broad and asymmetric H profiles with large emission-to-absorption ratios and (ii) near-peak luminosity in excess of predictions from SN shock cooling models both point to circumstellar interactions in this SN. Early colour evolution exhibits a short-lived blueward motion in $B-V$ within the first few days and continuous reddening in $V-i$, inconsistent with simple blackbody heating. Our simulations of SN light curves estimate 13 $M_\odot$ and 680 $R_\odot$ for the mass and radius of the progenitor, respectively, together with CSM of 0.73 $M_\odot$ to account for the excess luminosity and rapid post-peak declines. We discuss the origin of its short plateau and early colour evolution in the context of partial envelope stripping of the progenitor star and a delayed SN shock breakout near the edge of the CSM, respectively, as indicated by our simulations. We establish a correlation between post-peak decline rates and CSM mass in Type II SNe, highlighting that CSM interactions play a major role in shaping the post-peak evolution of transitional types.</description>

      <title>Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a $\gamma$ dimensional measure embedded in an $N$ dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in $N$ dimensions and projected into $D$ dimensions.
  It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected $\gamma$ dimensional measure is $P_j \propto 2^{-j\gamma}$. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, $N$, and the projected dimension, $D$. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space.
  Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from $\gamma = 1.7$ for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to $\gamma = 2.5$ for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.</description>

      <title>Timing and Spectral Analysis of 4U 1626-67 Using AstroSat/LAXPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of AstroSat/LAXPC data of the second spin-up and second spin-down phases of the persistent X-ray pulsar 4U 1626-67. Flares followed by a broad dip are detected in the spin-up observations. The pulse profiles changed from a shoulder-like structure to a broad sinusoidal shape as the source underwent a torque reversal from spin-up to spin-down. Energy-resolved pulse profiles in lower energies showed a double-horned profile in the spin-up state and a flat top with multiple peaks in the spin-down state. Regardless of the torque state, the pulse profiles exhibit a broad single-peaked shape at higher energies. The observation in the spin-down era is characterised by the presence of a prominent QPO at 46.5 +/- 1.0 mHz frequency. The QPO rms and centre frequency show a correlation with energy. Spin-up and spin-down states show a difference in the shape of the power density spectrum. After the torque reversal, a gradual flux drop and the hardening of the spectra were observed. The difference in the shape of the pulse profiles and the presence and absence of QPOs can be explained by the change in accretion flow geometry of the pulsar, from pencil-beam to fan-beam, between spin-down and spin-up states.</description>

      <title>The Accretion Properties and Jet Mechanisms for the Low-Excitation Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio galaxies (RGs) are a subclass of active galactic nuclei, which are suggested to be the parent populations of blazars. According to the accretion-ejection paragram, RGs can be classified into low-excitation or high-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs or HERGs). In this paper, we compiled a distance-limited ($z&lt;0.15$) sample of 431 LERGs (Fanaroff-Riley, or FR, type 0, I, and II RGs) to discuss their jet formation mechanism with the ADAF (advection-dominated accretion flow) scenario, and compare their accretion properties with Fermi BL Lacertae objects. We explored different jet mechanisms (Blandford-Znajek [BZ] model and a mixture of the BZ and Blandford-Payne, hybrid, model) within the framework of ADAF-type disc around a Kerr black hole for both LERGs and Fermi BL Lacs. Based on standard assumptions on the accretion-ejection coupling in RGs, the maximum kinetic jet and accretion power for FR 0s, FR Is, FR IIs can be, explained by an ADAF with the pure BZ mechanism or hybrid jet mechanism. In addition, for one third of the FR IIs, to account for their higher kinetic jet power than what is simply expected by the hybrid jet mechanism, the magnetic field could play an important role as in the form of magnetization-driven outflows or stronger magnetic structures, as observed in some BL Lacs with high jet powers. Similarities between BL Lacs and LERGs (e.g., accretion-ejection and clustering properties) suggest that high synchrotron peaked BL Lacs could be the beamed counterparts of FR 0s, and a potential general unification between LERGs and BL Lacs populations is discussed. However, a complete sample of BL Lacs is needed to robustly compare the jet and accretion properties with those of LERGs in the future.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the intermediate-mass-element ejecta in the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A studied with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide crucial information of yet poorly understood mechanism of supernova explosion. Here we present XRISM high-resolution spectroscopy of the intermediate-mass-element (IME) ejecta in the SNR Cas A to determine their velocity distribution and thermal properties. The XRISM/Resolve spectrum in the 1.75-2.95 keV band extracted from each $1' \times 1'$ region in the southeast and northwest rims is fitted with a model consisting of two-component plasmas in non-equilibrium ionization with different radial velocities and ionization timescales. It is found that the more highly ionized component has a larger radial velocity, suggesting that this component is distributed in the outer layer and thus has been heated by the SNR reverse shock earlier. We also perform proper motion measurement of the highly ionized component (represented by the Si XIV Ly$\alpha$ emission), using archival Chandra data, to reconstruct the three-dimensional velocity of the outermost IME ejecta. The pre-shock (free expansion) velocity of these ejecta is estimated to range from 2400 to 7100 km s$^{-1}$, based on the thermal properties and the bulk velocity of the shocked ejecta. These velocities are consistent with theoretical predictions for a Type IIb supernova, in which the progenitor's hydrogen envelope is largely stripped before the explosion. Furthermore, we find a substantial asymmetry in the distribution of the free expansion velocities, with the highest value toward the direction opposite to the proper motion of the neutron star (NS). This indicates the physical association between the asymmetric supernova explosion and NS kick.</description>

      <title>The persistent shift in spin-down rate following the largest Crab pulsar glitch rules out external torque variations due to starquakes</title>

Abstract: It was previously believed that, the long-term persistent increase in the spin-down rate of the Crab pulsar following a glitch is direct evidence of a starquake-induced glitch or at least related to a starquake. Using radio data covering 1710 days following the 2017 glitch, we obtain an extreme persistent increase of the spin-down rate, which allows to test two prevailing models related to starquake through an interrelation analysis between glitch size (the amplitude of the frequency step at a glitch) and persistent increase in the spin-down rate of the star. Our results do not support the hypothesis that glitches induce the external torque variation of the Crab pulsar, which may indicate no occurrence of starquake during the Crab pulsar glitch. This can explain why no changes in the radio and X-ray flux, pulse profile and spectrum of the Crab pulsar have been observed. We also suggest an internal mechanism due to superfluidity as an explanation for the long-term persistent shift in spin-down rate of the Crab pulsar following the relatively large glitches.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent in-situ fast flavor transformations in post-neutron star merger disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remnant black hole-accretion disk system resulting from binary neutron star mergers has proven to be a promising site for synthesizing the heaviest elements via rapid neutron capture (r-process). A critical factor in determining the full r-process pattern in these environments is the neutron richness of the ejecta, which is strongly influenced by neutrino interactions. One key ingredient shaping these interactions is fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFCs), which arise due to angular crossings in neutrino distributions and occur on nanosecond timescales. We present the first three-dimensional, in-situ, angle-dependent modeling of FFCs in post-merger disks, implemented within general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with Monte Carlo neutrino transport. Our results reveal that, by suppressing electron neutrinos, FFCs more efficiently cool the disk and weaken the early thermally driven wind. Less re-leptonization due to electron neutrino absorption makes this cooler wind more neutron-rich, producing a more robust r-process at higher latitudes of the outflow. This study underscores the necessity of incorporating FFCs in realistic simulations.</description>

      <title>A new independent look at the galactic black hole low-mass X-ray binary distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigations of the Galactic black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs) offer valuable insights into the elusive black hole population in the Milky Way. Motivated by recent tensions in the natal kick velocity distribution and BH mass distribution of BH-LMXBs, we revisit the spatial distribution of the Galactic BH-LMXBs using a new set of distance measurements obtained from an X-ray spectral modelling framework that we introduced in earlier work. We perform a multiparameter simulation study to mitigate part of the bias present in our prior estimates and gain insights into possible observational selection effects that affect the observed population. We derive a bias correction factor, well described by a Pareto probability density function that closely follows an inverse-square law dependence on distance. We then construct a bias-corrected, literature-independent, Galactic spatial distribution that clearly traces spiral arm structures and shows a deficit of sources very close to the Galactic centre, which might be explained due to high extinction or a true paucity of these sources at that region. Further analysis of the simulation results provides hints for a hidden population of BH-LMXBs at low Galactic heights. Lastly, we estimate the root-mean-squared Galactic height and find that it is most compatible with a hybrid scenario of BH formation, with some BHs receiving high natal kicks and thus propelled further from the thin disc plane while others receiving low natal kicks and remaining close to their birth place.</description>

      <title>Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies Beyond the Local X-ray Universe: An X-ray spectral sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow-line Seyfert 1 AGNs (NLS1s) represent a unique stage in the black hole growth history, characterised by low black hole masses of approximately $10^{6}$-$10^{8}$ solar masses and around-Eddington accretion rates. X-ray studies of NLS1s have largely been confined to the local Universe ($z &lt; 0.2$), while their broad-line counterparts and radio-loud quasars have been more extensively investigated at higher redshifts. In this work, we conducted an X-ray spectral analysis for 14 SDSS-observed NLS1s at $z\approx1$ in the eRASS1 catalogue. We found that all of their eROSITA observations agree with the expected rest-frame 2 keV monochromatic luminosity given their rest-frame 2500 angstrom monochromatic luminosity, further supporting evidence of AGN emission. Second, when fitted with a power-law model, most continuum spectra between 0.7-7 keV in their rest frames necessitate photon indices $\Gamma\gtrsim2.5$. Notably, the highest photon index of around 4.7 in one of our NLS1 AGNs hints at a significant contribution from soft excess emission. Finally, our analysis demonstrates that we can align the Eddington ratios with optical measurements by applying a correction factor between 10-120 to their X-ray luminosity. Although measurement uncertainty remains considerable, our findings suggest that assumptions for the standard geometrically thin accretion disc model made in previous estimations of this correction factor may not apply to near or super-Eddington NLS1 AGNs. Finally, we also compare this sample with extremely variable nearby NLS1s and other X-ray-weak AGNs, such as JWST-observed, broad-line AGNs at $z=5-6$, and underscores the importance of deeper X-ray surveys for more X-ray-weak NLS1s.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources I: Expected fraction of signals with significant dephasing in the dynamical and AGN channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first overview of the expected quantity of signals which will showcase significant gravitational wave phase shifts caused by astrophysical environments, considering the upcoming A+ and A\# LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. We construct and analyse two general families of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources, as well as collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun physical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for stellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical interactions. We compute the expected fraction of signals containing astrophysical dephasing, as a function of environmental properties and based on observed distributions of binary parameters. We find that next generation detectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected signals.</description>

      <title>Non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes excited by tidal resonances in binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the last seconds of a binary neutron-star merger, the tidal force can excite stellar oscillation modes to large amplitudes. From the perspective of premerger electromagnetic emissions and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, gravity ($g-$) modes constitute a propitious class. However, existing estimates for their impact employ linear schemes which may be inaccurate for large amplitudes, as achieved by tidal resonances. With rotation, inertial modes can be excited as well and while their non-linear saturation has been studied, an extension to fully-consistent gravito-inertial modes, especially in the neutron-star context, is an open problem. We study the linear and non-linear saturation of gravito-inertial modes and investigate the astrophysical consequences for binary neutron-star mergers, including the possibility of resonance-induced dynamo activity. A new (non-)linear formulation based on the separation of equilibrium and dynamical tides is developed. Implementing this into the 3D pseudo-spectral code MagIC, a suite of non-linear simulations of tidally-excited flows with an entropy/composition gradient in a stably-stratified Boussinesq spherical-shell are carried out. The new formulation accurately reproduces results of linear calculations for gravito-inertial modes with a free surface for low frequencies. For a constant-density cavity, we show that the axisymmetric differential rotation induced by nonlinear $_2g$ and $_1g$ modes may theoretically be large enough to amplify an ambient magnetic field to $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ G. In addition, rich non-linear dynamics are observed in the form of a parametric instability for the $_1g$ mode. The stars are also spun-up, which extends the resonance window for any given mode.</description>

      <title>EP240414a: Off-axis View of a Jet-Cocoon System from an Expanded Progenitor Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a relativistic jet is launched following the core-collapse of a star, its interaction with the stellar envelope leads to the formation of a hot cocoon, which produces various viewing-angle-dependent observational phenomena following the breakout from the surface. We study the observational signatures of fast X-ray transient (FXT) EP240414a, which may originate from a jet-cocoon system viewed slightly off-axis. In our model, (1) the prompt X-ray emission lasting $\sim\! 100\,{\rm{s}}$ is attributed to the cooling emission from the inner cocoon (shocked jet material); (2) the $\sim\! 0.1\,{\rm{d}}$ X-ray emission comes from the inner cocoon's afterglow; (3) the $\sim\! 0.4\,{\rm{d}}$ thermal-dominated optical emission arises from the cooling of the outer cocoon (shocked stellar material); (4) the $\sim\! 3\,{\rm{d}}$ non-thermal optical component and subsequent radio emission can be explained by the afterglow from a jet with a viewing angle of $10^{\circ}\lesssim \theta_{\rm{v}}\lesssim15^\circ$; and (5) the associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova only dominates the optical emission after $\sim\! 7\rm\, d$. Both the jet inferred from the off-axis afterglow and the inner cocoon constrained by the cooling emission are found to have similar kinetic energies, on the order of $10^{51}\,{\rm{erg}}$. We find that the progenitor's radius is $\sim3\,R_\odot$ as constrained by the { inner cocoon's} cooling emissions, indicating that the pre-explosion star may be a massive helium star that is slightly inflated. More FXTs associated with off-axis jets and supernovae will be further examined by the Einstein Probe, leading to a deeper understanding of jet-cocoon systems.</description>

      <title>High Energy Emission from the Intrabinary Shocks in Redback Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrabinary shocks (IBS) of spider pulsars emit non-thermal synchrotron X-rays from accelerated electrons and positrons in the shocked pulsar wind, likely energized by magnetic reconnection. In redback spider pulsars, the IBS typically wraps around the sub-stellar companion, leading to a near-normal IBS shock with relatively bright X-ray emission. The characteristic energies of radiating particles and the magnetic fields in the IBS suggest spectral features in the hard X-ray band. Here we perform joint soft-hard X-ray analyses of three redback pulsars, J1723-2837, J2215+5135, and J2339-0533, including new J2215 NuSTAR data. We identify a significant cooling break in J1723-2837 and a marginal break in J2215+5135, while placing constraints on the break energy in J2339-0533. Interpreting these as synchrotron cooling features allows us to estimate the IBS magnetic field $B_{\rm IBS} \sim 40-100$ G and place lower bounds on the maximum radiating electron energy. Our results constrain the magnetization of the pulsar wind as well as pair-production in millisecond pulsar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Precision cross-sections for advancing cosmic-ray physics. Input to the 2026 ESPPU from the XSCRC community</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest generation of cosmic-ray direct detection experiments is providing a wealth of high-precision data, stimulating a very rich and active debate in the community on the related strong discovery and constraining potentials on many topics, namely dark matter nature, and the sources, acceleration, and transport of Galactic cosmic rays. However, interpretation of these data is strongly limited by the uncertainties on nuclear and hadronic cross-sections. This contribution is one of the outcomes of the \textit{Cross-Section for Cosmic Rays at CERN} workshop series, that built synergies between experimentalists and theoreticians from the astroparticle, particle physics, and nuclear physics communities. A few successful and illustrative examples of CERN experiments' efforts to provide missing measurements on cross-sections are presented. In the context of growing cross-section needs from ongoing, but also planned, cosmic-ray experiments, a road map for the future is highlighted, including overlapping or complementary cross-section needs from applied topics (e.g., space radiation protection and hadrontherapy).</description>

      <title>Probing plasma scattering screens towards the quasar 2005+403 with long-term RATAN-600 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue investigating the observed properties of the quasar 2005$+$403 seen through the highly turbulent plasma in the Cygnus region. Our earlier study Koryukova+2023 revealed a great influence of propagation effects on the observed data, e.g. numerous episodes of multiple imaging formation, angular broadening of the source size, and the detection of an extreme scattering event (ESE) in 2019, making it a good probe for thermal plasma in the interstellar medium (ISM). We report the first detection of multi-frequency and multi-epoch ESEs revealed with the RATAN-600 daily light curves of the quasar 2005$+$403. The most prominent ESE flux density modulations are found in 2011, 2015, and 2020 and each lasted about $4-5$ months. We fitted the detected ESEs jointly at 4.7/4.8, 7.7/8.2, and 11.2~GHz using the models, which allowed us to constrain the angular and linear size of the scattering lens averaged over the three ESEs $0.3\pm0.1$ mas and $0.6\pm0.1$ au, proper motion $8.3\pm0.7$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and transverse velocity $70.1\pm5.7$ km s$^{-1}$ assuming that the lens distance is 1.8 kpc, maximum free-electron density on the line of sight $1183\pm124$ cm$^{-3}$ and lens mass $(0.8\pm0.4)\times10^{-15}\,\rm M_\odot$. Using the fitting results, we reconstructed the intrinsic unscattered angular size of the quasar at the ESE epochs. We also report on the first detection of up to six ESEs in a row that occurred in the period of $2015-2016$, apparently created by multiple lenses successively crossing the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Motions of Test Particles in Gravitational Field, Perturbations and Greybody Factor of Bardeen-like AdS Black Hole with Phantom Global Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of test particles, perturbations, and greybody factors within the framework of a Bardeen-like AdS black hole (BH) with a phantom global monopole. This study explores the interactions between nonlinear electrodynamics, the energy scale of symmetry breaking, and space-time topology. We analyze the geodesic motion of null and time-like particles, deriving effective potentials that describe their trajectories. Utilizing the Regge-Wheeler potential, we calculate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) for scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, applying the sixth-order WKB approximation. Our findings highlight how the Bardeen-like parameter ($\mathrm{b}$) and the energy scale of symmetry breaking, characterized by the parameter ($\eta$), influence the QNM spectra, with potential implications for gravitational wave observations. We also examine greybody factors, focusing on the transmission and reflection coefficients for scalar and axial fields, and employ semi-analytic techniques to derive precise bounds. Furthermore, we assess the thermodynamic stability of the BH, emphasizing the role of these parameters in phase transitions and stability criteria.</description>

      <title>Chorus: Optimizing Synchrotron Transfer Coefficients with Weighted Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate synchrotron transfer coefficients are essential for modeling radiation processes in astrophysics. However, their current calculation methods face significant challenges. Analytical approximations of the synchrotron emissivity, absorptivity, and rotativity are limited to a few simple electron distribution functions that inadequately capture the complexity of cosmic plasmas. Numerical integrations of the transfer coefficients, on the other hand, are accurate but computationally prohibitive for large-scale simulations. In this paper, we present a new numerical method, Chorus, which evaluates the transfer coefficients by expressing any electron distribution function as a weighted sum of functions with known analytical formulas. Specifically, the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution function is employed as the basic component in the weighted sum. The Chorus leverages the additivity of transfer coefficients, drawing inspiration from an analogous approach that uses stochastic averaging to approximate the $\kappa$ distribution function. The key findings demonstrate median errors below $5\%$ for emissivity and absorptivity, with run times reduced from hours to milliseconds compared to first-principles numerical integrations. Validation against a single $\kappa$ distribution, as well as its extension to more complex distributions, confirms the robustness and versatility of the method. However, limitations are found, including increased errors at higher energies due to numerical precision constraints and challenges with rotativity calculations arising from fit function inaccuracies. Addressing these issues could further enhance the method's reliability. Our method has the potential to provide a powerful tool for radiative transfer simulations, where synchrotron emission is the main radiative process.</description>

      <title>Exploring Compact Symmetric Objects with Complex Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are a unique class of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) defined by sub-kpc radio emission, showing radio structure on both sides of the central engine. CSOs tend to exhibit little to no relativistic beaming, thereby allowing us to determine their physical characteristics, such as the magnetic field strength and particle energy density. Selected with a literature search, we describe VLBI observations, imaging, and analyses of 167 CSO candidates. We identified 65 new bona fide CSOs, thus almost doubling the number of known bona fide CSOs to 144. With our greater breadth of sources, we confirm that edge-dimmed CSOs (CSO-1s) may represent a more diverse population than originally expected. We highlight a number of CSOs with complex morphologies, including candidates for supermassive binary black holes (SBBHs) and CSOs that appear to have morphologies akin to wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxies, which could perhaps indicate that some CSOs are experiencing a galactic merger.</description>

      <title>Detectability of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries with the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can amplify ultralight bosonic fields through superradiance, forming macroscopic clouds known as gravitational atoms. When the cloud forms around one of the components of a binary system, it can undergo a series of distinctive interactions, comprising both secular effects, such as dynamical friction or accretion, and resonant behaviour. These processes are expected to leave a distinctive signature on the gravitational waveform emitted by the binary, whose detectability we investigate in this paper. To do so, we implement a numerical code that integrates these effects, computed within a Newtonian approximation, for intermediate-to-high mass-ratio binaries on circular equatorial orbits. Realistic waveforms incorporating these environmental influences are generated and analyzed using the Fisher matrix formalism to evaluate the detectability of bosonic clouds with current and next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories. Our results demonstrate the potential for gravitational wave astronomy to probe the existence and properties of ultralight bosons.</description>

      <title>A MeerKAT survey of nearby dwarf novae: I. New detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A program to search for radio emission from dwarf-novae-type cataclysmic variables was conducted with the South African MeerKAT radio telescope. The dwarf novae RU Pegasi, V426 Ophiuchi and IP Pegasi were detected during outburst at L-band (1284 MHz central frequency). Previously, only one cataclysmic variable was radio-detected at a frequency this low. We now bring the number to four. With these three newly found radio-emitters, the population of dwarf novae confirmed to be radio-emitting at any frequency reaches 10 systems. We found that the radio luminosity is correlated with the optical luminosity. For V426 Ophiuchi and RU Pegasi we found a radio decline contemporary with the outburst's optical decline. The peak radio luminosity of dwarf novae in outburst is very similar to that of novalike Cataclysmic Variables and no correlation with orbital period is seen.</description>

      <title>Multispacecraft Observations of the 2024 September 9 Backside Solar Eruption that Resulted in a Sustained Gamma Ray Emission Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the 2024 September 9 sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) event observed by the Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi satellite. The event was associated with a backside solar eruption observed by multiple spacecraft such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SolO), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Wind, and GOES, and by ground based radio telescopes. SolO Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X rays (STIX) imaged an intense flare, which occurred about 41 deg behind the east limb, from heliographic coordinates S13E131. Forward modeling of the CME flux rope revealed that it impulsively accelerated (3.54 km s^{-2}) to attain a peak speed of 2162 km s^{-1}. SolO energetic particle detectors (EPD) observed protons up to about 1 GeV from the extended shock and electrons that produced a complex type II burst and possibly type III bursts. The durations of SGRE and type II burst are consistent with the linear relation between these quantities obtained from longer duration (exceeding 3 hours) SGRE events. All these observations are consistent with an extended shock surrounding the CME flux rope, which is the likely source of high energy protons required for the SGRE event. We compare this event with six other BTL SGRE eruptions and find that they are all consistent with energetic shock driving CMEs. We also find a significant east west asymmetry in the BTL source locations.</description>

      <title>Explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars undergoing iron core collapse at the end of their evolution terminate their lives either in successful or failed supernovae (SNe). The physics of core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is complex, and their understanding requires computationally expensive simulations. The sampling of large, densely sampled parameter spaces of SN progenitors, as is needed e.g. for population synthesis studies, is thus not feasible. To remedy this situation, we present criteria that allow us to predict the final fates of stars by evaluating multiple explodability proxies derived from the stellar structure at the onset of core collapse. These are formulated based on the outcomes of a semi-analytic supernova model, evaluated over a set of ~3,900 heterogeneous stellar progenitors (single stars, binary-stripped and accretor stars). Over these, the explodabiliy criteria achieve an accuracy of &gt;99% agreement with the semi-analytic model. The criteria are tested on 29 state-of-the-art 3D CCSN simulation outcomes from two different groups. Furthermore, we find that all explodability proxies needed for our pre-SN criteria have two distinct peaks and intervening valleys as a function of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass $M_\mathrm{CO}$, which coincide with failed and successful SNe, respectively. The CO core masses of explodability peaks shift systematically with metallicity, $Z$, and with the timing of hydrogen-rich envelope removal in binary-stripped stars. With these, we identify critical values in $M_\mathrm{CO}$ that define windows over which black holes form by direct collapse. The outcome is a CCSN recipe based on $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and $Z$, applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies. Our explodability formalism is consistent with SN observations that constrain the progenitor $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and partially addresses the missing red supergiant problem by direct black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Populations of evolved massive binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud I: Predictions from detailed evolution models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The majority of massive stars are born with a close binary companion. How this affects their evolution and fate is still largely uncertain, especially at low metallicity. Aims. We derive synthetic populations of massive post-interaction binary products and compare them with corresponding observed populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. We analyse 53298 detailed binary evolutionary models computed with MESA. Our models include the physics of rotation, mass and angular momentum transfer, magnetic internal angular momentum transport, and tidal spin-orbit coupling. They cover initial primary masses of 5-100Msun, initial mass ratios of 0.3-0.95, and all initial periods for which interaction is expected. They are evolved through the first mass transfer and the donor star death, a possible ensuing Be/X-ray binary phase, and they end when the mass gainer leaves the main sequence. Results.In our fiducial synthetic population, 8% of the OB stars in the SMC are post-mass transfer systems, and 7% are merger products. In many of our models, the mass gainers are spun up and form Oe/Be stars. While our model underpredicts the number of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, it reproduces the main features of their orbital period distribution and the observed number of SMC binary WR stars. We expect $\sim$50 OB+BH binaries below and $\sim$170 above 20d orbital period. The latter might produce merging double BHs. However, their progenitors, the predicted long-period WR+OB binaries, are not observed. Conclusions. While the comparison with the observed SMC stars supports many physics assumptions in our high-mass binary models, a better match of the large number of observed OBe stars and Be/X-ray binaries likely requires a lower merger rate and/or a higher mass transfer efficiency during the first mass transfer. The fate of the initially wide O star binaries remains uncertain.</description>

Abstract: Massive star evolution plays a crucial role in astrophysics but bares large uncertainties. This problem becomes more severe by the majority of massive stars being born in close binary systems, whose evolution is affected by the interaction of their components. We want to constrain major uncertainties in massive binary star evolution, in particular the efficiency and the stability of the first mass transfer phase. We use the rapid population synthesis code ComBinE to generate synthetic populations of post-interaction binaries, assuming constant mass-transfer efficiency. We employ a new merger criterion that adjusts self-consistently to any prescribed mass-transfer efficiency. We tailor our synthetic populations to be comparable to the expected binary populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We find that the observed populations of evolved massive binaries can not be reproduced with a single mass-transfer efficiency. Instead, a rather high efficiency (&gt;50%) is needed to reproduce the number of Be stars and Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, while a low efficiency (~10%) leads to a better agreement with the observed number of Wolf-Rayet stars. We construct a corresponding mass-dependent mass-transfer efficiency recipe to produce our fiducial synthetic SMC post-interaction binary population. It reproduces the observed number and properties of the Be/X-ray and WR-binaries rather well, and is not in stark disagreement with the observed OBe star population. It further predicts two large, yet unobserved populations of OB+BH binaries, that is ~100 OB+BH systems with rather small orbital periods (&lt;20 days) and ~40 longer period OBe+BH systems.</description>

      <title>Written in the Stars: How your (pens and) papers decide the fate of the arXiverse</title>

Abstract: We all love the ecstasy that comes with submitting papers to journals or arXiv. Some have described it as yeeting their back-breaking products of labor into the void, wishing they could never deal with them ever again. The very act of yeeting papers onto arXiv contributes to the expansion of the arXiverse; however, we have yet to quantify our contribution to the cause. In this work, I investigate the expansion of the arXiverse using the arXiv astro-ph submission data from 1992 to date. I coin the term "the arXiverse constant", $a_0$, to quantify the rate of expansion of the arXiverse. I find that astro-ph as a whole has a positive $a_0$, but this does not always hold true for the six subcategories of astro-ph. I then investigate the temporal changes in $a_0$ for the astro-ph subcategories and astro-ph as a whole, from which I infer the fate of the arXiverse.</description>

      <title>High frequency breaks in optical active galactic nuclei power spectral density</title>

Abstract: Context. Variability is a ubiquitous feature of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and the characterisation of the variability is crucial to constrain its physical mechanism and proper applications in AGN studies. The advent of all-sky and high-cadence optical surveys allows more accurate measurements of AGNs variability down to short timescales and direct comparisons with X-ray variability from the same sample of sources. Aims. We aim to analyse the optical power spectral density (PSDs) of AGNs with measured X-ray PSDs. Methods. We use light curves from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to obtain PSDs. The joint optical PSD is measured over up to six orders of magnitude in frequency space from timescales of minutes to a decade. We fit either a damped random walk (DRW) or a broken power law (BPL) model to constrain the PSD model and break frequency. Results. We find a set of break frequencies ($\lesssim10^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$) from DRW and BPL fits that generally confirm previously reported correlations between break frequencies and the black hole mass. In addition, we find a second set of break frequencies at higher frequencies ($&gt;10^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$). We observe a potential weak correlation between the high-frequency breaks with the X-ray break frequencies and black hole mass. We further explore the dependence of the correlations on other AGN parameters, finding that adding either X-ray, optical, or bolometric luminosity as the third correlation parameter can substantially improve the correlation significances. The newly identified high-frequency optical breaks can constrain different aspects of the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Revealing EMRI/IMRI candidates with quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first detection of the quasiperiodic ultrafast outflow in the ASASSN-20qc system was reported by Pasham et al. (2024). The outflow is revealed in the soft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is periodically enhanced every ~8.3 days. The periodic nature of the ultrafast outflow is best explained by an orbiting massive perturber, most likely an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), that is inclined with respect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this way, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the outflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukova et al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (QPOuts) are thus a novel phenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intemediate-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI) candidates that otherwise do not exhibit significant periodic patterns in the continuum flux density.</description>

      <title>Neutrino and pair creation in reconnection-powered coronae of accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems is their hard X-ray emission which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons in the vicinity of the black hole, in a region with optical depth of order unity. The origin and composition of this Comptonizing region, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. In this paper we investigate the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets for the pair enrichment and neutrino emission of AGN coronae. Our model has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. For sources with $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd} \gtrsim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$ (where $\lambda_{\rm Edd, crit} \sim 10^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^5$ or $\sim 10^{-2}$ for $\sigma_{\rm p}=10^7$), proton-photon interactions and $ \gamma \gamma$ annihilation produce enough secondary pairs to achieve Thomson optical depths $\tau_{\rm T} \sim 0.1-10$. In the opposite case of $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd} \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$, the coronal pairs cannot originate only from hadronic interactions. Additionally, we find that the neutrino luminosity scales as $L^2_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ for $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd} \lesssim \lambda_{\rm Edd, crit}$, while it is proportional to $L_{\rm X}$ for higher $\lambda_{\rm X, Edd}$ values. We apply our model to four Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 1068, and discuss our results in light of recent IceCube observations.</description>

      <title>On the origin of multifrequency temporal and spectral variability in Ton 599</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the broadband temporal and spectral properties of the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) Ton 599. We collected the long-term data from Jan 2019 to August 2024 when the source was in a long flaring episode. We used the Bayesian block methodology to identify the various flux states, including three flares. The broadband fractional variability is estimated during two flaring states. The Fvar variation with respect to frequency shows a nearly double hump structure similar to broadband SED. The Power spectral density (PSD) shows a pink-noise kind of stochastic variability in the light curve and we do not see any break in the power spectrum, suggesting a much longer characteristic time scale is involved in gamma-ray variability. The flux distribution is well-fitted with a double log-normal flux distribution, suggesting the variability of non-linear in nature. The gamma-ray, optical, and X-ray emissions were found to be highly correlated with a zero time lag, suggesting a co-spatial origin of their emissions. We used the one-zone leptonic model to reproduce the broad-band spectrum in the energy range from IR to very high-energy gamma-ray. The increase in the magnetic field and the Doppler factor were found to be the main cause for high flux states. The XMM-Newton spectra taken during one of the flaring durations exhibit a signature of thermal black body emission from the accretion disk, suggesting a possible disk-jet coupling. This has also been indicated by the gamma-ray flux distribution, which shows the distribution as non-linear in nature, which is mostly seen in galactic X-ray binaries or AGN where the accretion disk dominates the emission.</description>

      <title>Let there be neutrons! Hadronic photoproduction from a large flux of high-energy photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photohadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.</description>

Abstract: The breaking of translational symmetry in the inner crust of a neutron star leads to the depletion of the neutron superfluid reservoir similarly to cold atomic condensates in optical lattices and in supersolids. This effect is studied in the general framework of the self-consistent time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory, treating the crust as a perfect crystal. The superfluid fraction is derived in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approximation for superfluid velocities much smaller than Landau's critical velocity within the linear-response theory. The different assumptions made in previous studies are clarified. Fully three-dimensional band-structure calculations of superfluid neutrons in a body-centered cubic lattice are carried out. Although the formation of Cooper pairs is essential for the occurrence of superfluidity, the superfluid fraction is found to be insensitive to the pairing gap, as in uniform neutron matter. In the intermediate region of the inner crust at the average baryon number density 0.03 fm$^{-3}$, only 8\% of the free neutrons are found to participate to the superflow. Such very low superfluid fraction challenges the classical interpretation of pulsar frequency glitches and calls for more systematic calculations within the full HFB approach.</description>

      <title>Detection and parameter estimation of supermassive black hole ringdown signals using a pulsar timing array</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) searches using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are commonly assumed to be limited to a GW frequency of $\lesssim 4\times 10^{-7}$Hz given by the Nyquist rate associated with the average observational cadence of $2$ weeks for a single pulsar. However, by taking advantage of asynchronous observations of multiple pulsars, a PTA can detect GW signals at higher frequencies. This allows a sufficiently large PTA to detect and characterize the ringdown signals emitted following the merger of supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), leading to stringent tests of the no-hair theorem in the mass range of such systems. Such large-scale PTAs are imminent with the advent of the FAST telescope and the upcoming era of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). To scope out the data analysis challenges involved in such a search, we propose a likelihood-based method coupled with Particle Swarm Optimization and apply it to a simulated large-scale PTA comprised of $100$ pulsars, each having a timing residual noise standard deviation of $100$~nsec, with randomized observation times. Focusing on the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of the ringdown signal, we show that it is possible to achieve a $99\%$ detection probability with a false alarm probability below $0.2\%$ for an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$. This corresponds, for example, to an equal-mass non-spinning SMBBH with an observer frame chirp mass $M_c = 9.52\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ at a luminosity distance of $D_L = 420$ Mpc.</description>

Abstract: To date, over 4000 pulsars have been detected. In this study, we identify 231 X-ray counterparts of Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) pulsars by performing a spatial cross match across the Chandra, XMM-Newton observational catalogs. This dataset represents the largest sample of X-ray counterparts ever compiled, including 98 normal pulsars (NPs) and 133 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Based on this significantly expanded sample, we re-establish the correlation between X-ray luminosity and spin-down power, given by $L_{\rm X} \propto \dot{E}^{0.85\pm0.05}$ across the whole X-ray band. The strong correlation is also observed in hard X-ray band, while in soft X-ray band there is no significant correlation. Furthermore, $L_{\rm X}$ shows a strong correlation with spin period and characteristic age for NPs. For the first time, we observe a strongly positive correlation between $L_{\rm X}$ and the light cylinder magnetic field ($B_{\rm lc}$) for MSPs, with both NPs and MSPs following the relationship $L_{\rm X} \propto B_{\rm lc}^{1.14}$, consistent with the outer-gap model of pulsars that explains the mechanism of X-ray emission. Additionally, we investigate potential X-ray counterparts for Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot pulsars, finding a lower likelihood of detection compared to ATNF pulsars.</description>

Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiative-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright ultraviolet (UV) flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Gravitational Wave Events with Host Environment Escape Velocities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe the parameters and origin channels of gravitational wave events using the escape velocities of their host environments. This method could lead to more convergent posterior distributions offering additional insights into the physical properties, formation, and evolution of the sources. The method provides more accurate parameter estimation for events that represent previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario and is valuable for the search for such mergers with third-generation ground-based detectors. To demonstrate this approach, we take six recently identified events in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, considered as potential previous mergers in hierarchical triple mergers, as examples. The use of escape velocities results in posterior spin distributions that are concentrated near zero, aligning with the expected birth spins of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars. The uncertainty in the posterior primary mass distribution is significantly reduced comparing with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA distributions, especially for events modeled under the assumption of a globular cluster origin scenario. We rule out the possibility that GW190512, GW170729, and GW190708 originates from globular clusters as previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario.</description>

      <title>The Compton-Getting origin of the large-scale anisotropy of Galactic cosmic rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the anisotropy in cosmic-ray arrival directions can provide insight into local acceleration sites and propagation conditions. We developed a unified framework to interpret both the observed energy spectra and the large-scale anisotropy. In this work, we explore the influence of the Sun's motion relative to the local plasma frame--the Compton-Getting (CG) effect--on the anisotropy. We find that incorporating the CG effect could reduce the dipole amplitude and slightly shift the phase away from the direction of the local regular magnetic field at tens of TeV. At lower energies, where the anisotropy from the cosmic-ray density gradient is weak, the Sun's relative motion becomes more prominent. Below $\sim 200$ GeV, the dipole amplitude increases again, approaching the value expected from the CG effect. Additionally, a phase flip is observed at a few hundred GeV, aligning with the CG direction. Future anisotropy measurements from $100$ GeV to TeV energies could serve as a critical test of this effect.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic jets originating at the center of AGN are embedded in extreme environments with strong magnetic fields and high particle densities, which makes them a fundamental tool for studying the physics of magnetized plasmas. We aim to investigate the magnetic field structure and the pc/sub-pc properties of the relativistic jet in the radio galaxy 3C111. Rotation Measure (RM) studies of nearby radio galaxies, such as this one, provide a valuable tool to investigate transversal magnetic field properties of the synchrotron emission. We model the brightness distribution of the source with multiple 2D Gaussian components to characterize individual emission features. After determining the core shift, we compute the spectral index maps for all the frequency pairs and find different distributions for the core region and the jet with an unusual optically thick/flat feature at 1-2 pc from the core. Using modelfit, we find a total of 56 components at different frequencies. By putting constraints on the size and position, we identify 22 components at different frequencies for which we compute the equipartition magnetic field. We compute the RM at two different triplets of frequencies. At 15.2-21.9-43.8 GHz, we discover high values of RM in the same region where the optically thick/flat feature was found. This can be associated with high electron density at 1-2 pc from the core that we interpreted as originating in a cloud of the clumpy torus. At 5-8.4-15.2 GHz, we find a distribution of the EVPAs and significant RM transverse gradient that provide strong evidence of a helical configuration of the magnetic field, as found in simulations.</description>

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) in scalar-tensor theories of gravitation with the phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization can develop significant deviations from general relativity. Cases with a massless scalar were studied widely. Here we compare the NS scalarizations in the Damour--Esposito-Far{\`e}se theory, the Mendes-Ortiz theory, and the $\xi$-theory with a massive scalar field. Numerical solutions for slowly rotating NSs are obtained. They are used to construct the X-ray pulse profiles of a pair of extended hot spots on the surface of NSs. We also calculate the tidal deformability for NSs with spontaneous scalarization which is done for the first time with a massive scalar field. We show the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the tidal deformability. The X-ray pulse profiles, the tidal deformability, and the universal relation may help to constrain the massive scalar-tensor theories in X-ray and gravitational-wave observations of NSs, including the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) satellite, Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, and LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA laser interferometers.</description>

Abstract: We systematically derive the chiral kinetic theory for chiral fermions with collisions, including the self-energy corrections, from quantum field theories. We find that the Wigner functions and chiral kinetic equations receive both the classical and quantum corrections from the self-energies and their spacetime gradients. We also apply this formalism to study nonequilibrium neutrino transport due to the interaction with thermalized electrons and nucleons, as realized in core-collapse supernovae. We derive neutrino currents along magnetic fields and neutrino spin Hall effect induced by the density gradient at first order in the Fermi constant $G_{\rm F}$ for anisotropic neutrino distributions.</description>

      <title>Neural post-Einsteinian framework for efficient theory-agnostic tests of general relativity with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework and its variants are widely used to probe gravity through gravitational-wave tests that apply to a large class of theories beyond general relativity. However, the ppE framework is not truly theory-agnostic as it only captures certain types of deviations from general relativity: those that admit a post-Newtonian series representation in the inspiral of coalescing compact objects. Moreover, each type of deviation in the ppE framework has to be tested separately, making the whole process computationally inefficient and expensive, possibly obscuring the theoretical interpretation of potential deviations that could be detected in the future. We here present the neural post-Einsteinian (npE) framework, an extension of the ppE formalism that overcomes the above weaknesses using deep-learning neural networks. The core of the npE framework is a variational autoencoder that maps the discrete ppE theories into a continuous latent space in a well-organized manner. This design enables the npE framework to test many theories simultaneously and to select the theory that best describes the observation in a single parameter estimation run. The smooth extension of the ppE parametrization also allows for more general types of deviations to be searched for with the npE model. We showcase the application of the new npE framework to future tests of general relativity with the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. In particular, the npE framework is demonstrated to efficiently explore modifications to general relativity beyond what can be mapped by the ppE framework, including modifications coming from higher-order curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high post-Newtonian order, and dark-photon interactions in possibly hidden sectors of matter that do not admit a post-Newtonian representation.</description>

      <title>From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: a Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the full range of densities in between with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. Bayesian multi-model inference from $\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories. In this work, we introduce a correlated Bayesian model mixing framework that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to assimilate different information into a single QCD EOS for symmetric nuclear matter. The present implementation uses a stationary GP to infer this mixed EOS solely from the EOSs of $\chi$EFT and pQCD while accounting for the truncation errors of each theory. The GP is trained on the pressure as a function of number density in the low- and high-density regions where $\chi$EFT and pQCD are, respectively, valid. We impose priors on the GP kernel hyperparameters to suppress unphysical correlations between these regimes. This, together with the assumption of stationarity, results in smooth $\chi$EFT-to-pQCD curves for both the pressure and the speed of sound. We show that using uncorrelated mixing requires uncontrolled extrapolation of at least one of $\chi$EFT or pQCD into regions where the perturbative series breaks down and leads to an acausal EOS. We also discuss extensions of this framework to non-stationary and less differentiable GP kernels, its future application to neutron-star matter, and the incorporation of additional constraints from nuclear theory, experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: Extreme mass-ratio limit and final memory offset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect is a strong-field relativistic phenomenon that is associated with a persistent change in the GW strain after the passage of a GW. The nonlinear effect arises from interactions of GWs themselves in the wave zone and is an observable effect connected to the infrared properties of general relativity. The detection of the GW memory effect is possible with LIGO and Virgo in a population of binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers or from individual events with next-generation ground- and space-based GW detectors or pulsar timing arrays. Matched-filtering-based searches for the GW memory require accurate, and preferably rapid-to-evaluate waveform models of the memory effect's GW signal. One important element of such a waveform model is a model for the final memory offset -- namely, the net change in strain between early and late times. In this paper, we construct a model for the final memory offset from the merger of nonspinning BBH systems in quasicircular orbits. A novel ingredient of this model is that we first compute the memory signal for extreme mass-ratio inspirals using a high post-Newtonian-order analytic calculation, and we use this analytical result to fix the coefficient in the fit which is linear in the mass-ratio. The resulting memory-offset fit could be used for detecting the GW memory for binaries that merge on a timescale that is short relative to the inverse of the low-frequency cutoff of a GW detector. Additionally, this fit will be useful for analytic waveform models of the GW memory signals in the time and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Forward Ray Tracing and Hot Spots in Kerr Spacetime</title>

Abstract: Hotspots, often characterized as pointlike emissions, frequently appear near black holes with significantly enhanced luminosity compared to the surrounding accretion flow. Notably, such hotspots are regularly observed near the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Light rays emitted from these sources follow complex trajectories around the black hole before reaching distinct locations on the observer's image plane. Precisely resolving both direct emissions and their higher-order images--despite the latter's intensity suppression--is essential for extracting detailed spacetime information, including the black hole's mass, spin, and inclination angle. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of hotspot modeling, we develop a forward ray tracing method based on the analytic integral solution of Kerr geodesics, leveraging conserved quantities. Our approach traces geodesics from a given emission point near the black hole to a distant observer, effectively capturing multiple images with a tailored parametrization scheme for root-finding. By perturbing these geodesics, we map finite-size emissions to distinct regions on the image plane, enabling the quantification of image shapes and amplification rates. This method not only enhances the identification of strongly lensed photons from black holes but also enables efficient spacetime tomography and hotspot localization, leveraging observations from the Event Horizon Telescope and its upcoming next-generation upgrades.</description>

      <title>Which is which? Identification of the two compact objects in gravitational-wave binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact objects observed in gravitational-wave astronomy so far always come in pairs and never individually. Identifying the two components of a binary system is a delicate operation that is often taken for granted. The labeling procedure (i.e., which is object "1" and which is object "2") effectively acts as systematics, or, equivalently an unspecified prior, in gravitational-wave data inference. The common approach is to label the objects solely by their masses, on a sample-by-sample basis. We show that object identification can instead be tackled using the posterior distribution as a whole. We frame the problem in terms of constrained clustering -- a flavor of semi-supervised machine learning -- and find that unfolding the labeling systematics can significantly impact, and arguably improve, our interpretation of the data. In particular, the precision of black-hole spin measurements improves by up to 50%, multimodalities and tails tend to disappear, posteriors become closer to Gaussian distributions, and the identification of the nature of the object (i.e. black hole vs. neutron star) is facilitated. We estimate that about 10% of the LIGO/Virgo posterior samples are affected by this relabeling, i.e. they might have been attributed to the other compact object in the observed binaries.</description>

      <title>Temporal Correlation between Positive-Charged Cosmic Ray Flux and Solar Polar Field Variation: Insights from Delayed Modulation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the time-dependent modulation of galactic cosmic rays near Earth, with a focus on the cosmic proton flux and polar field. Using data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) and the Wilcox Solar Observatory, we identify a significant time-lagged relationship between the observation of two missions. Our model incorporates a weighted magnetic field parameter to address the hemispheric asymmetry in polar fields and captures the temporal evolution of cosmic-ray proton spectra in relation to solar activity. We find a time lag of approximately 10 months, varying with cosmic ray rigidity. At 1 GV, the time lag is 360 days, while it is 300 days above 3 GV. A potential mechanism is proposed to explain the observed time-lagged relationship and its dependence on cosmic ray rigidity. This offers predictive insights into cosmic ray modulation within the heliosphere. These results enhance the accuracy of space weather forecasting models, with significant implications for the safety of space missions and aviation.</description>

      <title>Formation of giant radio sources in galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04467v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing debates. We utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. To avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). Finally, we also study the energy transport processes of different jets. We find the "lower power-larger bubble" effect: lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.</description>

      <title>Amoeba: An AGN Model of Optical Emissions Beyond steady-state Accretion discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are objects located in the heart of galaxies which emit powerful and complex radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. Understanding AGN has become a topic of interest due to their importance in galactic evolution and their ability to act as a probe to the distant Universe. Within the next few years, wide-field surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Rubin Vera Observatory are expected to increase the number of known AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{7})$ and the number of strongly lensed AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{4})$. In this paper we introduce \texttt{Amoeba}: an AGN Model of Optical Emission Beyond steady-state Accretion discs. The goal of \texttt{Amoeba} is to provide a modular and flexible modelling environment for AGN, in which all components can interact with each other. Through this work we describe the framework for major AGN components to vary self-consistently and keep flux distributions to connect these components to spatial dependent processes. We model properties beyond traditional single-component models, such as the reverberation of the corona's bending power law power spectrum through the accretion disc and broad line region (BLR). We simulate obscuration by the dusty torus and differential magnification of the disc and BLR due to microlensing. These features are joined together to create some of the most realistic light curve simulations to date. \texttt{Amoeba} takes a step forward in AGN modelling by joining the accretion disc, BLR, torus, intrinsic signal, and microlensing into a coherent model.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals. Our framework, independent of any specific gravitational theory, offers a universal tool for testing gravitational theories and interpreting astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV Dark Matter Direct Detection with Neutrino Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new technique for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) searches and a new use of neutrino observatories. DM-electron scattering in an observatory can excite or ionize target molecules, which then produce light that can be detected by the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). While individual DM scatterings are undetectable, the aggregate rate from many independent scatterings can be isolated from the total PMT dark rate using the expected DM annual modulation. We showcase this technique with the example of JUNO, a 20,000-ton scintillator detector, showing that its sensitivity in some mass ranges exceeds all other techniques and reaches key particle-theory benchmarks.</description>
