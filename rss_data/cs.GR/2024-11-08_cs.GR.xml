      <title>DimensionX: Create Any 3D and 4D Scenes from a Single Image with Controllable Video Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \textbf{DimensionX}, a framework designed to generate photorealistic 3D and 4D scenes from just a single image with video diffusion. Our approach begins with the insight that both the spatial structure of a 3D scene and the temporal evolution of a 4D scene can be effectively represented through sequences of video frames. While recent video diffusion models have shown remarkable success in producing vivid visuals, they face limitations in directly recovering 3D/4D scenes due to limited spatial and temporal controllability during generation. To overcome this, we propose ST-Director, which decouples spatial and temporal factors in video diffusion by learning dimension-aware LoRAs from dimension-variant data. This controllable video diffusion approach enables precise manipulation of spatial structure and temporal dynamics, allowing us to reconstruct both 3D and 4D representations from sequential frames with the combination of spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, to bridge the gap between generated videos and real-world scenes, we introduce a trajectory-aware mechanism for 3D generation and an identity-preserving denoising strategy for 4D generation. Extensive experiments on various real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DimensionX achieves superior results in controllable video generation, as well as in 3D and 4D scene generation, compared with previous methods.</description>

      <title>ReCapture: Generative Video Camera Controls for User-Provided Videos using Masked Video Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, breakthroughs in video modeling have allowed for controllable camera trajectories in generated videos. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to user-provided videos that are not generated by a video model. In this paper, we present ReCapture, a method for generating new videos with novel camera trajectories from a single user-provided video. Our method allows us to re-generate the reference video, with all its existing scene motion, from vastly different angles and with cinematic camera motion. Notably, using our method we can also plausibly hallucinate parts of the scene that were not observable in the reference video. Our method works by (1) generating a noisy anchor video with a new camera trajectory using multiview diffusion models or depth-based point cloud rendering and then (2) regenerating the anchor video into a clean and temporally consistent reangled video using our proposed masked video fine-tuning technique.</description>

      <title>A Novel 3D Mapping Representation and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of mapping relationships and distortions in multidimensional data poses a significant challenge in contemporary research. While Beltrami coefficients offer a precise description of distortions in two-dimensional mappings, current tools lack this capability in the context of three-dimensional space. This paper presents a novel approach: a 3D quasiconformal representation that captures the local dilation of 3D mappings, along with a reconstruction algorithm that establishes a connection between this representation and the corresponding mapping. Experimental results showcase the algorithm's effectiveness in mapping reconstruction, keyframe interpolation, and mapping compression. These features bear a resemblance to the 2D Linear Beltrami Solver technique. The work presented in this paper offers a promising solution for the precise analysis and adjustment of distortions in 3D data and mappings.</description>

      <title>NeuralClothSim: Neural Deformation Fields Meet the Thin Shell Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite existing 3D cloth simulators producing realistic results, they predominantly operate on discrete surface representations (e.g. points and meshes) with a fixed spatial resolution, which often leads to large memory consumption and resolution-dependent simulations. Moreover, back-propagating gradients through the existing solvers is difficult, and they cannot be easily integrated into modern neural architectures. In response, this paper re-thinks physically plausible cloth simulation: We propose NeuralClothSim, i.e., a new quasistatic cloth simulator using thin shells, in which surface deformation is encoded in neural network weights in the form of a neural field. Our memory-efficient solver operates on a new continuous coordinate-based surface representation called neural deformation fields (NDFs); it supervises NDF equilibria with the laws of the non-linear Kirchhoff-Love shell theory with a non-linear anisotropic material model. NDFs are adaptive: They 1) allocate their capacity to the deformation details and 2) allow surface state queries at arbitrary spatial resolutions without re-training. We show how to train NeuralClothSim while imposing hard boundary conditions and demonstrate multiple applications, such as material interpolation and simulation editing. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our continuous neural formulation. See our project page: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/NeuralClothSim/.</description>

      <title>WoCoCo: Learning Whole-Body Humanoid Control with Sequential Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid activities involving sequential contacts are crucial for complex robotic interactions and operations in the real world and are traditionally solved by model-based motion planning, which is time-consuming and often relies on simplified dynamics models. Although model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for versatile and robust whole-body humanoid control, it still requires tedious task-specific tuning and state machine design and suffers from long-horizon exploration issues in tasks involving contact sequences. In this work, we propose WoCoCo (Whole-Body Control with Sequential Contacts), a unified framework to learn whole-body humanoid control with sequential contacts by naturally decomposing the tasks into separate contact stages. Such decomposition facilitates simple and general policy learning pipelines through task-agnostic reward and sim-to-real designs, requiring only one or two task-related terms to be specified for each task. We demonstrated that end-to-end RL-based controllers trained with WoCoCo enable four challenging whole-body humanoid tasks involving diverse contact sequences in the real world without any motion priors: 1) versatile parkour jumping, 2) box loco-manipulation, 3) dynamic clap-and-tap dancing, and 4) cliffside climbing. We further show that WoCoCo is a general framework beyond humanoid by applying it in 22-DoF dinosaur robot loco-manipulation tasks.</description>
