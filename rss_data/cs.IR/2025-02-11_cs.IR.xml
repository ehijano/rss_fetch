      <title>Hypencoder: Hypernetworks for Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of retrieval models depend on vector inner products to produce a relevance score between a query and a document. This naturally limits the expressiveness of the relevance score that can be employed. We propose a new paradigm, instead of producing a vector to represent the query we produce a small neural network which acts as a learned relevance function. This small neural network takes in a representation of the document, in this paper we use a single vector, and produces a scalar relevance score. To produce the little neural network we use a hypernetwork, a network that produce the weights of other networks, as our query encoder or as we call it a Hypencoder. Experiments on in-domain search tasks show that Hypencoder is able to significantly outperform strong dense retrieval models and has higher metrics then reranking models and models an order of magnitude larger. Hypencoder is also shown to generalize well to out-of-domain search tasks. To assess the extent of Hypencoder's capabilities, we evaluate on a set of hard retrieval tasks including tip-of-the-tongue retrieval and instruction-following retrieval tasks and find that the performance gap widens substantially compared to standard retrieval tasks. Furthermore, to demonstrate the practicality of our method we implement an approximate search algorithm and show that our model is able to search 8.8M documents in under 60ms.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Domain Scaling for Personalized Sequential Modeling in Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Users generally exhibit complex behavioral patterns and diverse intentions in multiple business scenarios of super applications like Douyin, presenting great challenges to current industrial multi-domain recommenders. To mitigate the discrepancies across diverse domains, researches and industrial practices generally emphasize sophisticated network structures to accomodate diverse data distributions, while neglecting the inherent understanding of user behavioral sequence from the multi-domain perspective. In this paper, we present Adaptive Domain Scaling (ADS) model, which comprehensively enhances the personalization capability in target-aware sequence modeling across multiple domains. Specifically, ADS comprises of two major modules, including personalized sequence representation generation (PSRG) and personalized candidate representation generation (PCRG). The modules contribute to the tailored multi-domain learning by dynamically learning both the user behavioral sequence item representation and the candidate target item representation under different domains, facilitating adaptive user intention understanding. Experiments are performed on both a public dataset and two billion-scaled industrial datasets, and the extensive results verify the high effectiveness and compatibility of ADS. Besides, we conduct online experiments on two influential business scenarios including Douyin Advertisement Platform and Douyin E-commerce Service Platform, both of which show substantial business improvements. Currently, ADS has been fully deployed in many recommendation services at ByteDance, serving billions of users.</description>

      <title>Large Memory Network for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling user behavior sequences in recommender systems is essential for understanding user preferences over time, enabling personalized and accurate recommendations for improving user retention and enhancing business values. Despite its significance, there are two challenges for current sequential modeling approaches. From the spatial dimension, it is difficult to mutually perceive similar users' interests for a generalized intention understanding; from the temporal dimension, current methods are generally prone to forgetting long-term interests due to the fixed-length input sequence. In this paper, we present Large Memory Network (LMN), providing a novel idea by compressing and storing user history behavior information in a large-scale memory block. With the elaborated online deployment strategy, the memory block can be easily scaled up to million-scale in the industry. Extensive offline comparison experiments, memory scaling up experiments, and online A/B test on Douyin E-Commerce Search (ECS) are performed, validating the superior performance of LMN. Currently, LMN has been fully deployed in Douyin ECS, serving millions of users each day.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model for Interest Refinement in Multi-Interest Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-interest candidate matching plays a pivotal role in personalized recommender systems, as it captures diverse user interests from their historical behaviors. Most existing methods utilize attention mechanisms to generate interest representations by aggregating historical item embeddings. However, these methods only capture overall item-level relevance, leading to coarse-grained interest representations that include irrelevant information. To address this issue, we propose the Diffusion Multi-Interest model (DMI), a novel framework for refining user interest representations at the dimension level. Specifically, DMI first introduces controllable noise into coarse-grained interest representations at the dimensional level. Then, in the iterative reconstruction process, DMI combines a cross-attention mechanism and an item pruning strategy to reconstruct the personalized interest vectors with the guidance of tailored collaborative information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DMI, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test. Successfully deployed in the real-world recommender system, DMI effectively enhances user satisfaction and system performance at scale, serving the major traffic of hundreds of millions of daily active users. \footnote{The code will be released for reproducibility once the paper is accepted.}</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Vector Search: An Experimental Evaluation of the State-of-the-Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector data is prevalent across business and scientific applications, and its popularity is growing with the proliferation of learned embeddings. Vector data collections often reach billions of vectors with thousands of dimensions, thus, increasing the complexity of their analysis. Vector search is the backbone of many critical analytical tasks, and graph-based methods have become the best choice for analytical tasks that do not require guarantees on the quality of the answers. We briefly survey in-memory graph-based vector search, outline the chronology of the different methods and classify them according to five main design paradigms: seed selection, incremental insertion, neighborhood propagation, neighborhood diversification, and divide-and-conquer. We conduct an exhaustive experimental evaluation of twelve state-of-the-art methods on seven real data collections, with sizes up to 1 billion vectors. We share key insights about the strengths and limitations of these methods; e.g., the best approaches are typically based on incremental insertion and neighborhood diversification, and the choice of the base graph can hurt scalability. Finally, we discuss open research directions, such as the importance of devising more sophisticated data-adaptive seed selection and diversification strategies.</description>

      <title>FlashCheck: Exploration of Efficient Evidence Retrieval for Fast Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advances in digital tools have led to the rampant spread of misinformation. While fact-checking aims to combat this, manual fact-checking is cumbersome and not scalable. It is essential for automated fact-checking to be efficient for aiding in combating misinformation in real-time and at the source. Fact-checking pipelines primarily comprise a knowledge retrieval component which extracts relevant knowledge to fact-check a claim from large knowledge sources like Wikipedia and a verification component. The existing works primarily focus on the fact-verification part rather than evidence retrieval from large data collections, which often face scalability issues for practical applications such as live fact-checking. In this study, we address this gap by exploring various methods for indexing a succinct set of factual statements from large collections like Wikipedia to enhance the retrieval phase of the fact-checking pipeline. We also explore the impact of vector quantization to further improve the efficiency of pipelines that employ dense retrieval approaches for first-stage retrieval. We study the efficiency and effectiveness of the approaches on fact-checking datasets such as HoVer and WiCE, leveraging Wikipedia as the knowledge source. We also evaluate the real-world utility of the efficient retrieval approaches by fact-checking 2024 presidential debate and also open source the collection of claims with corresponding labels identified in the debate. Through a combination of indexed facts together with Dense retrieval and Index compression, we achieve up to a 10.0x speedup on CPUs and more than a 20.0x speedup on GPUs compared to the classical fact-checking pipelines over large collections.</description>

      <title>HCMRM: A High-Consistency Multimodal Relevance Model for Search Ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search advertising is essential for merchants to reach the target users on short video platforms. Short video ads aligned with user search intents are displayed through relevance matching and bid ranking mechanisms. This paper focuses on improving query-to-video relevance matching to enhance the effectiveness of ranking in ad systems. Recent vision-language pre-training models have demonstrated promise in various multimodal tasks. However, their contribution to downstream query-video relevance tasks is limited, as the alignment between the pair of visual signals and text differs from the modeling of the triplet of the query, visual signals, and video text. In addition, our previous relevance model provides limited ranking capabilities, largely due to the discrepancy between the binary cross-entropy fine-tuning objective and the ranking objective. To address these limitations, we design a high-consistency multimodal relevance model (HCMRM). It utilizes a simple yet effective method to enhance the consistency between pre-training and relevance tasks. Specifically, during the pre-training phase, along with aligning visual signals and video text, several keywords are extracted from the video text as pseudo-queries to perform the triplet relevance modeling. For the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a hierarchical softmax loss, which enables the model to learn the order within labels while maximizing the distinction between positive and negative samples. This promotes the fusion ranking of relevance and bidding in the subsequent ranking stage. The proposed method has been deployed in the Kuaishou search advertising system for over a year, contributing to a 6.1% reduction in the proportion of irrelevant ads and a 1.4% increase in ad revenue.</description>

      <title>Uni-Retrieval: A Multi-Style Retrieval Framework for STEM's Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret abstract text descriptions is crucial for ensuring high-quality teaching. However, current retrieval models primarily focus on natural text-image retrieval, making them insufficiently tailored to educational scenarios due to the ambiguities in the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a diverse expression retrieval task tailored to educational scenarios, supporting retrieval based on multiple query styles and expressions. We introduce the STEM Education Retrieval Dataset (SER), which contains over 24,000 query pairs of different styles, and the Uni-Retrieval, an efficient and style-diversified retrieval vision-language model based on prompt tuning. Uni-Retrieval extracts query style features as prototypes and builds a continuously updated Prompt Bank containing prompt tokens for diverse queries. This bank can updated during test time to represent domain-specific knowledge for different subject retrieval scenarios. Our framework demonstrates scalability and robustness by dynamically retrieving prompt tokens based on prototype similarity, effectively facilitating learning for unknown queries. Experimental results indicate that Uni-Retrieval outperforms existing retrieval models in most retrieval tasks. This advancement provides a scalable and precise solution for diverse educational needs.</description>

      <title>FactIR: A Real-World Zero-shot Open-Domain Retrieval Benchmark for Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of automated fact-checking increasingly depends on retrieving web-based evidence to determine the veracity of claims in real-world scenarios. A significant challenge in this process is not only retrieving relevant information, but also identifying evidence that can both support and refute complex claims. Traditional retrieval methods may return documents that directly address claims or lean toward supporting them, but often struggle with more complex claims requiring indirect reasoning. While some existing benchmarks and methods target retrieval for fact-checking, a comprehensive real-world open-domain benchmark has been lacking. In this paper, we present a real-world retrieval benchmark FactIR, derived from Factiverse production logs, enhanced with human annotations. We rigorously evaluate state-of-the-art retrieval models in a zero-shot setup on FactIR and offer insights for developing practical retrieval systems for fact-checking. Code and data are available at https://github.com/factiverse/factIR.</description>

      <title>NLGR: Utilizing Neighbor Lists for Generative Rerank in Personalized Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reranking plays a crucial role in modern multi-stage recommender systems by rearranging the initial ranking list. Due to the inherent challenges of combinatorial search spaces, some current research adopts an evaluator-generator paradigm, with a generator generating feasible sequences and an evaluator selecting the best sequence based on the estimated list utility. However, these methods still face two issues. Firstly, due to the goal inconsistency problem between the evaluator and generator, the generator tends to fit the local optimal solution of exposure distribution rather than combinatorial space optimization. Secondly, the strategy of generating target items one by one is difficult to achieve optimality because it ignores the information of subsequent items.
  To address these issues, we propose a utilizing Neighbor Lists model for Generative Reranking (NLGR), which aims to improve the performance of the generator in the combinatorial space. NLGR follows the evaluator-generator paradigm and improves the generator's training and generating methods. Specifically, we use neighbor lists in combination space to enhance the training process, making the generator perceive the relative scores and find the optimization direction. Furthermore, we propose a novel sampling-based non-autoregressive generation method, which allows the generator to jump flexibly from the current list to any neighbor list. Extensive experiments on public and industrial datasets validate NLGR's effectiveness and we have successfully deployed NLGR on the Meituan food delivery platform.</description>

      <title>RALLRec: Improving Retrieval Augmented Large Language Model Recommendation with Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into recommendation systems to enhance user behavior comprehension. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique is further incorporated into these systems to retrieve more relevant items and improve system performance. However, existing RAG methods rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, limiting the effectiveness of the systems.
  In this paper, we propose Representation learning for retrieval-Augmented Large Language model Recommendation (RALLRec). Specifically, we enhance textual semantics by prompting LLMs to generate more detailed item descriptions, followed by joint representation learning of textual and collaborative semantics, which are extracted by the LLM and recommendation models, respectively. Considering the potential time-varying characteristics of user interest, a simple yet effective reranking method is further introduced to capture the dynamics of user preference. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the evaluation results validated the effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Evaluating Entity Retrieval in Electronic Health Records: a Semantic Gap Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entity retrieval plays a crucial role in the utilization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and is applied across a wide range of clinical practices. However, a comprehensive evaluation of this task is lacking due to the absence of a public benchmark. In this paper, we propose the development and release of a novel benchmark for evaluating entity retrieval in EHRs, with a particular focus on the semantic gap issue. Using discharge summaries from the MIMIC-III dataset, we incorporate ICD codes and prescription labels associated with the notes as queries, and annotate relevance judgments using GPT-4. In total, we use 1,000 patient notes, generate 1,246 queries, and provide over 77,000 relevance annotations. To offer the first assessment of the semantic gap, we introduce a novel classification system for relevance matches. Leveraging GPT-4, we categorize each relevant pair into one of five categories: string, synonym, abbreviation, hyponym, and implication. Using the proposed benchmark, we evaluate several retrieval methods, including BM25, query expansion, and state-of-the-art dense retrievers. Our findings show that BM25 provides a strong baseline but struggles with semantic matches. Query expansion significantly improves performance, though it slightly reduces string match capabilities. Dense retrievers outperform traditional methods, particularly for semantic matches, and general-domain dense retrievers often surpass those trained specifically in the biomedical domain.</description>

      <title>Progressive Collaborative and Semantic Knowledge Fusion for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent surge in interest surrounding generative paradigms, generative recommendation has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers in the recommendation community. This paradigm generally consists of two stages. In the first stage, pretrained semantic embeddings or collaborative ID embeddings are quantized to create item codes, aiming to capture and preserve rich semantic or collaborative knowledge within these codes. The second stage involves utilizing these discrete codes to perform an autoregressive sequence generation task. Existing methods often either overlook collaborative or semantic knowledge, or combine the two roughly. In this paper, we observe that naively concatenating representations from semantic and collaborative modality leads to a semantic domination issue, where the resulting representation is overly influenced by semantic information, effectively overshadowing the collaborative representation. Consequently, downstream recommendation tasks fail to fully exploit the knowledge from both modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a progressive collaborative and semantic knowledge fusion model for generative recommendation, named PRORec, which integrates semantic and collaborative knowledge with a unified code through a two-stage framework. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a cross-modality knowledge alignment task, which integrates semantic knowledge into collaborative embeddings, enhancing their representational capability. In the second stage, we propose an in-modality knowledge distillation task, designed to effectively capture and integrate knowledge from both semantic and collaborative modalities. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>LiveForesighter: Generating Future Information for Live-Streaming Recommendations at Kuaishou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live-streaming, as a new-generation media to connect users and authors, has attracted a lot of attention and experienced rapid growth in recent years. Compared with the content-static short-video recommendation, the live-streaming recommendation faces more challenges in giving our users a satisfactory experience: (1) Live-streaming content is dynamically ever-changing along time.

      <title>The 2021 Tokyo Olympics Multilingual News Article Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a dataset of multilingual news articles covering the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. A total of 10,940 news articles were gathered from 1,918 different publishers, covering 1,350 sub-events of the 2021 Olympics, and published between July 1, 2021, and August 14, 2021. These articles are written in nine languages from different language families and in different scripts. To create the dataset, the raw news articles were first retrieved via a service that collects and analyzes news articles. Then, the articles were grouped using an online clustering algorithm, with each group containing articles reporting on the same sub-event. Finally, the groups were manually annotated and evaluated. The development of this dataset aims to provide a resource for evaluating the performance of multilingual news clustering algorithms, for which limited datasets are available. It can also be used to analyze the dynamics and events of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics from different perspectives. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be accessed from the CLARIN.SI repository.</description>

      <title>Efficient Knowledge Feeding to Language Models: A Novel Integrated Encoder-Decoder Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to efficiently feeding knowledge to language models (LLMs) during prediction by integrating retrieval and generation processes within a unified framework. While the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model addresses gaps in LLMs' training data and knowledge limits, it is hindered by token limit restrictions and dependency on the retrieval system's accuracy. Our proposed architecture incorporates in-context vectors (ICV) to overcome these challenges. ICV recasts in-context learning by using latent embeddings of LLMs to create a vector that captures essential task information. This vector is then used to shift the latent states of the LLM, enhancing the generation process without adding demonstration examples to the prompt. ICV directly integrates information into the model, enabling it to process this information more effectively. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that ICV outperforms standard in-context learning and fine-tuning across question-answering, information retrieval, and other tasks. This approach mitigates the limitations of current RAG models and offers a more robust solution for handling extensive and diverse datasets. Despite leveraging a fraction of the parameters, our ICV-enhanced model achieves competitive performance against models like LLaMA-3, Gemma, and Phi-3, significantly reducing computational costs and memory requirements. ICV reduces prompt length, is easy to control, surpasses token limitations, and is computationally efficient compared to fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial On Intersectionality in Fair Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the critical issue of biased algorithms and unfair rankings, which have permeated various sectors, including search engines, recommendation systems, and workforce management. These biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes in a data-driven world, especially against marginalized and underrepresented groups. Efforts towards responsible data science and responsible artificial intelligence aim to mitigate these biases and promote fairness, diversity, and transparency. However, most fairness-aware ranking methods singularly focus on protected attributes such as race, gender, or socio-economic status, neglecting the intersectionality of these attributes, i.e., the interplay between multiple social identities. Understanding intersectionality is crucial to ensure that existing inequalities are not preserved by fair rankings. We offer a description of the main ways to incorporate intersectionality in fair ranking systems through practical examples and provide a comparative overview of existing literature and a synoptic table summarizing the various methodologies. Our analysis highlights the need for intersectionality to attain fairness, while also emphasizing that fairness, alone, does not necessarily imply intersectionality.</description>

      <title>LegalSeg: Unlocking the Structure of Indian Legal Judgments Through Rhetorical Role Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of semantic segmentation of legal documents through rhetorical role classification, with a focus on Indian legal judgments. We introduce LegalSeg, the largest annotated dataset for this task, comprising over 7,000 documents and 1.4 million sentences, labeled with 7 rhetorical roles. To benchmark performance, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models, including Hierarchical BiLSTM-CRF, TransformerOverInLegalBERT (ToInLegalBERT), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Role-Aware Transformers, alongside an exploratory RhetoricLLaMA, an instruction-tuned large language model. Our results demonstrate that models incorporating broader context, structural relationships, and sequential sentence information outperform those relying solely on sentence-level features. Additionally, we conducted experiments using surrounding context and predicted or actual labels of neighboring sentences to assess their impact on classification accuracy. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in distinguishing between closely related roles and addressing class imbalance. Our work underscores the potential of advanced techniques for improving legal document understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in legal NLP.</description>

      <title>Multi-Branch Collaborative Learning Network for Video Quality Assessment in Industrial Video Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is vital for large-scale video retrieval systems, aimed at identifying quality issues to prioritize high-quality videos. In industrial systems, low-quality video characteristics fall into four categories: visual-related issues like mosaics and black boxes, textual issues from video titles and OCR content, and semantic issues like frame incoherence and frame-text mismatch from AI-generated videos. Despite their prevalence in industrial settings, these low-quality videos have been largely overlooked in academic research, posing a challenge for accurate identification. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Branch Collaborative Network (MBCN) tailored for industrial video retrieval systems. MBCN features four branches, each designed to tackle one of the aforementioned quality issues. After each branch independently scores videos, we aggregate these scores using a weighted approach and a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism to dynamically address quality issues across different scenarios. We implement point-wise and pair-wise optimization objectives to ensure score stability and reasonableness. Extensive offline and online experiments on a world-level video search engine demonstrate MBCN's effectiveness in identifying video quality issues, significantly enhancing the retrieval system's ranking performance. Detailed experimental analyses confirm the positive contribution of all four evaluation branches. Furthermore, MBCN significantly improves recognition accuracy for low-quality AI-generated videos compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Prompt Sensitivity in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to variations in prompt formulation, which can significantly impact their ability to generate accurate responses. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Prompt Sensitivity Prediction, and a dataset PromptSET designed to investigate the effects of slight prompt variations on LLM performance. Using TriviaQA and HotpotQA datasets as the foundation of our work, we generate prompt variations and evaluate their effectiveness across multiple LLMs. We benchmark the prompt sensitivity prediction task employing state-of-the-art methods from related tasks, including LLM-based self-evaluation, text classification, and query performance prediction techniques. Our findings reveal that existing methods struggle to effectively address prompt sensitivity prediction, underscoring the need to understand how information needs should be phrased for accurate LLM responses.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Knowledge Integration in Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Self-Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), has proven effective in enabling LLMs to produce more accurate and reliable responses. However, it remains a significant challenge how to effectively integrate external retrieved knowledge with internal parametric knowledge in LLMs. In this work, we propose a novel Self-Selection RAG framework, where the LLM is made to select from pairwise responses generated with internal parametric knowledge solely and with external retrieved knowledge together to achieve enhanced accuracy. To this end, we devise a Self-Selection-RGP method to enhance the capabilities of the LLM in both generating and selecting the correct answer, by training the LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) over a curated Retrieval Generation Preference (RGP) dataset. Experimental results with two open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama2-13B-Chat and Mistral-7B) well demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other baseline methods on Natural Questions (NQ) and TrivialQA datasets.</description>

      <title>FunduSAM: A Specialized Deep Learning Model for Enhanced Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation in Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained popularity as a versatile image segmentation method, thanks to its strong generalization capabilities across various domains. However, when applied to optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation tasks, SAM encounters challenges due to the complex structures, low contrast, and blurred boundaries typical of fundus images, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel model, FunduSAM, which incorporates several Adapters into SAM to create a deep network specifically designed for OD and OC segmentation. The FunduSAM utilizes Adapter into each transformer block after encoder for parameter fine-tuning (PEFT). It enhances SAM's feature extraction capabilities by designing a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), addressing issues related to blurred boundaries and low contrast. Given the unique requirements of OD and OC segmentation, polar transformation is used to convert the original fundus OD images into a format better suited for training and evaluating FunduSAM. A joint loss is used to achieve structure preservation between the OD and OC, while accurate segmentation. Extensive experiments on the REFUGE dataset, comprising 1,200 fundus images, demonstrate the superior performance of FunduSAM compared to five mainstream approaches.</description>

Abstract: Recommender systems play a crucial role in modern life, including information retrieval, the pharmaceutical industry, retail, and entertainment. The entertainment sector, in particular, attracts significant attention and generates substantial profits. This work proposes a new method for predicting unknown user-movie ratings to enhance customer satisfaction. To achieve this, we utilize the MovieLens 100K dataset. Our approach introduces an attention-based autoencoder to create meaningful representations and the XGBoost method for rating predictions.

      <title>TF-DCon: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to Empower Training-Free Dataset Condensation for Content-Based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09874v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern techniques in Content-based Recommendation (CBR) leverage item content information to provide personalized services to users, but suffer from resource-intensive training on large datasets. To address this issue, we explore the dataset condensation for textual CBR in this paper. The goal of dataset condensation is to synthesize a small yet informative dataset, upon which models can achieve performance comparable to those trained on large datasets. While existing condensation approaches are tailored to classification tasks for continuous data like images or embeddings, direct application of them to CBR has limitations. To bridge this gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation for content-based recommendation. Inspired by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in text comprehension and generation, we leverage LLMs to empower the generation of textual content during condensation. To handle the interaction data involving both users and items, we devise a dual-level condensation method: content-level and user-level. At content-level, we utilize LLMs to condense all contents of an item into a new informative title. At user-level, we design a clustering-based synthesis module, where we first utilize LLMs to extract user interests. Then, the user interests and user embeddings are incorporated to condense users and generate interactions for condensed users. Notably, the condensation paradigm of this method is forward and free from iterative optimization on the synthesized dataset. Extensive empirical findings from our study, conducted on three authentic datasets, substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. Particularly, we are able to approximate up to 97% of the original performance while reducing the dataset size by 95% (i.e., on dataset MIND).</description>

      <title>Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems excel at capturing users' dynamic preferences by leveraging their interaction histories. Most existing SR systems assign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, and various types of models are adopted to combine these item embeddings into a sequence representation vector to capture the user intent. However, we argue that this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's multi-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Besides, users often exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking both action and musical films in the facet of genre), which are challenging to fully represent. To address the issues above, we propose a novel structure called Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the last multi-head attention layer to predict the next item separately. This approach captures the potential multi-faceted nature of items without increasing model complexity. A gating mechanism integrates recommendations from each head and dynamically determines their importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network in each attention head to disentangle various user preferences within each facet. Each expert within the MoE focuses on a specific preference. A learnable router network is adopted to compute the importance weight for each expert and aggregate them. We conduct extensive experiments on four public sequential recommendation datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing baseline models.</description>

      <title>MARM: Unlocking the Future of Recommendation Systems through Memory Augmentation and Scalable Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling-law has guided the language model designing for past years, however, it is worth noting that the scaling laws of NLP cannot be directly applied to RecSys due to the following reasons: (1) The amount of training samples and model parameters is typically not the bottleneck for the model. Our recommendation system can generate over 50 billion user samples daily, and such a massive amount of training data can easily allow our model parameters to exceed 200 billion, surpassing many LLMs (about 100B). (2) To ensure the stability and robustness of the recommendation system, it is essential to control computational complexity FLOPs carefully. Considering the above differences with LLM, we can draw a conclusion that: for a RecSys model, compared to model parameters, the computational complexity FLOPs is a more expensive factor that requires careful control. In this paper, we propose our milestone work, MARM (Memory Augmented Recommendation Model), which explores a new cache scaling-laws successfully.</description>

      <title>Explainable LLM-driven Multi-dimensional Distillation for E-Commerce Relevance Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective query-item relevance modeling is pivotal for enhancing user experience and safeguarding user satisfaction in e-commerce search systems. Recently, benefiting from the vast inherent knowledge, Large Language Model (LLM) approach demonstrates strong performance and long-tail generalization ability compared with previous neural-based specialized relevance learning methods. Though promising, current LLM-based methods encounter the following inadequacies in practice: First, the massive parameters and computational demands make it difficult to be deployed online. Second, distilling LLM models to online models is a feasible direction, but the LLM relevance modeling is a black box, and its rich intrinsic knowledge is difficult to extract and apply online. To improve the interpretability of LLM and boost the performance of online relevance models via LLM, we propose an Explainable LLM-driven Multi-dimensional Distillation framework for e-commerce relevance learning, which comprises two core components: (1) An Explainable LLM for relevance modeling (ELLM-rele), which decomposes the relevance learning into intermediate steps and models relevance learning as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, thereby enhancing both interpretability and performance of LLM. (2) A Multi-dimensional Knowledge Distillation (MKD) architecture that transfers the knowledge of ELLM-rele to current deployable interaction-based and representation-based student models from both the relevance score distribution and CoT reasoning aspects. Through distilling the probabilistic and CoT reasoning knowledge, MKD improves both the semantic interaction and long-tail generalization abilities of student models. Extensive offline evaluations and online experiments on Taobao search ad scene demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances e-commerce relevance learning performance and user experience.</description>

Abstract: Deep recommender systems rely heavily on large embedding tables to handle high-cardinality categorical features such as user/item identifiers, and face significant memory constraints at scale. To tackle this challenge, hashing techniques are often employed to map multiple entities to the same embedding and thus reduce the size of the embedding tables. Concurrently, graph-based collaborative signals have emerged as powerful tools in recommender systems, yet their potential for optimizing embedding table reduction remains unexplored. This paper introduces GraphHash, the first graph-based approach that leverages modularity-based bipartite graph clustering on user-item interaction graphs to reduce embedding table sizes. We demonstrate that the modularity objective has a theoretical connection to message-passing, which provides a foundation for our method. By employing fast clustering algorithms, GraphHash serves as a computationally efficient proxy for message-passing during preprocessing and a plug-and-play graph-based alternative to traditional ID hashing. Extensive experiments show that GraphHash substantially outperforms diverse hashing baselines on both retrieval and click-through-rate prediction tasks. In particular, GraphHash achieves on average a 101.52% improvement in recall when reducing the embedding table size by more than 75%, highlighting the value of graph-based collaborative information for model reduction.

      <title>Multimodal semantic retrieval for product search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic retrieval (also known as dense retrieval) based on textual data has been extensively studied for both web search and product search application fields, where the relevance of a query and a potential target document is computed by their dense vector representation comparison. Product image is crucial for e-commerce search interactions and is a key factor for customers at product explorations. However, its impact on semantic retrieval has not been well studied yet. In this research, we build a multimodal representation for product items in e-commerce search in contrast to pure-text representation of products, and investigate the impact of such representations. The models are developed and evaluated on e-commerce datasets. We demonstrate that a multimodal representation scheme for a product can show improvement either on purchase recall or relevance accuracy in semantic retrieval. Additionally, we provide numerical analysis for exclusive matches retrieved by a multimodal semantic retrieval model versus a text-only semantic retrieval model, to demonstrate the validation of multimodal solutions.</description>

      <title>360Brew: A Decoder-only Foundation Model for Personalized Ranking and Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ranking and recommendation systems are the foundation for numerous online experiences, ranging from search results to personalized content delivery. These systems have evolved into complex, multilayered architectures that leverage vast datasets and often incorporate thousands of predictive models. The maintenance and enhancement of these models is a labor intensive process that requires extensive feature engineering. This approach not only exacerbates technical debt but also hampers innovation in extending these systems to emerging problem domains. In this report, we present our research to address these challenges by utilizing a large foundation model with a textual interface for ranking and recommendation tasks. We illustrate several key advantages of our approach: (1) a single model can manage multiple predictive tasks involved in ranking and recommendation, (2) decoder models with textual interface due to their comprehension of reasoning capabilities, can generalize to new recommendation surfaces and out-of-domain problems, and (3) by employing natural language interfaces for task definitions and verbalizing member behaviors and their social connections, we eliminate the need for feature engineering and the maintenance of complex directed acyclic graphs of model dependencies. We introduce our research pre-production model, 360Brew V1.0, a 150B parameter, decoder-only model that has been trained and fine-tuned on LinkedIn's data and tasks. This model is capable of solving over 30 predictive tasks across various segments of the LinkedIn platform, achieving performance levels comparable to or exceeding those of current production systems based on offline metrics, without task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, each of these tasks is conventionally addressed by dedicated models that have been developed and maintained over multiple years by teams of a similar or larger size than our own.</description>

      <title>MIM: Multi-modal Content Interest Modeling Paradigm for User Behavior Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in recommendation systems, online searches, and advertising platforms, where accurately capturing users' real interests in content is essential for performance. However, existing methods heavily rely on ID embeddings, which fail to reflect users' true preferences for content such as images and titles. This limitation becomes particularly evident in cold-start and long-tail scenarios, where traditional approaches struggle to deliver effective results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-modal Content Interest Modeling paradigm (MIM), which consists of three key stages: Pre-training, Content-Interest-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (C-SFT), and Content-Interest-Aware UBM (CiUBM). The pre-training stage adapts foundational models to domain-specific data, enabling the extraction of high-quality multi-modal embeddings. The C-SFT stage bridges the semantic gap between content and user interests by leveraging user behavior signals to guide the alignment of embeddings with user preferences. Finally, the CiUBM stage integrates multi-modal embeddings and ID-based collaborative filtering signals into a unified framework. Comprehensive offline experiments and online A/B tests conducted on the Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of MIM method. The method has been successfully deployed online, achieving a significant increase of +14.14% in CTR and +4.12% in RPM, showcasing its industrial applicability and substantial impact on platform performance. To promote further research, we have publicly released the code and dataset at https://pan.quark.cn/s/8fc8ec3e74f3.</description>

      <title>LOCALINTEL: Generating Organizational Threat Intelligence from Global and Local Cyber Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security Operations Center (SoC) analysts gather threat reports from openly accessible global threat repositories and tailor the information to their organization's needs, such as developing threat intelligence and security policies. They also depend on organizational internal repositories, which act as private local knowledge database. These local knowledge databases store credible cyber intelligence, critical operational and infrastructure details. SoCs undertake a manual labor-intensive task of utilizing these global threat repositories and local knowledge databases to create both organization-specific threat intelligence and mitigation policies. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown the capability to process diverse knowledge sources efficiently. We leverage this ability to automate this organization-specific threat intelligence generation. We present LocalIntel, a novel automated threat intelligence contextualization framework that retrieves zero-day vulnerability reports from the global threat repositories and uses its local knowledge database to determine implications and mitigation strategies to alert and assist the SoC analyst. LocalIntel comprises two key phases: knowledge retrieval and contextualization. Quantitative and qualitative assessment has shown effectiveness in generating up to 93% accurate organizational threat intelligence with 64% inter-rater agreement.</description>

      <title>AgentMove: A Large Language Model based Agentic Framework for Zero-shot Next Location Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next location prediction plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Recently, due to the limitation of existing deep learning methods, attempts have been made to apply large language models (LLMs) to zero-shot next location prediction task. However, they directly generate the final output using LLMs without systematic design, which limits the potential of LLMs to uncover complex mobility patterns and underestimates their extensive reserve of global geospatial knowledge. In this paper, we introduce AgentMove, a systematic agentic prediction framework to achieve generalized next location prediction. In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task and design specific modules to complete them, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments utilizing mobility data from two distinct sources reveal that AgentMove surpasses the leading baseline by 3.33% to 8.57% across 8 out of 12 metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities.

      <title>Mask-based Membership Inference Attacks for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been an effective approach to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge. Recently, there has been a trend of storing up-to-date or copyrighted data in RAG knowledge databases instead of using it for LLM training. This practice has raised concerns about Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to detect if a specific target document is stored in the RAG system's knowledge database so as to protect the rights of data producers. While research has focused on enhancing the trustworthiness of RAG systems, existing MIAs for RAG systems remain largely insufficient. Previous work either relies solely on the RAG system's judgment or is easily influenced by other documents or the LLM's internal knowledge, which is unreliable and lacks explainability. To address these limitations, we propose a Mask-Based Membership Inference Attacks (MBA) framework. Our framework first employs a masking algorithm that effectively masks a certain number of words in the target document. The masked text is then used to prompt the RAG system, and the RAG system is required to predict the mask values. If the target document appears in the knowledge database, the masked text will retrieve the complete target document as context, allowing for accurate mask prediction. Finally, we adopt a simple yet effective threshold-based method to infer the membership of target document by analyzing the accuracy of mask prediction. Our mask-based approach is more document-specific, making the RAG system's generation less susceptible to distractions from other documents or the LLM's internal knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing baseline models.</description>

      <title>Orbit: A Framework for Designing and Evaluating Multi-objective Rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning in production needs to balance multiple objectives: This is particularly evident in ranking or recommendation models, where conflicting objectives such as user engagement, satisfaction, diversity, and novelty must be considered at the same time. However, designing multi-objective rankers is inherently a dynamic wicked problem -- there is no single optimal solution, and the needs evolve over time. Effective design requires collaboration between cross-functional teams and careful analysis of a wide range of information. In this work, we introduce Orbit, a conceptual framework for Objective-centric Ranker Building and Iteration. The framework places objectives at the center of the design process, to serve as boundary objects for communication and guide practitioners for design and evaluation. We implement Orbit as an interactive system, which enables stakeholders to interact with objective spaces directly and supports real-time exploration and evaluation of design trade-offs. We evaluate Orbit through a user study involving twelve industry practitioners, showing that it supports efficient design space exploration, leads to more informed decision-making, and enhances awareness of the inherent trade-offs of multiple objectives. Orbit (1) opens up new opportunities of an objective-centric design process for any multi-objective ML models, as well as (2) sheds light on future designs that push practitioners to go beyond a narrow metric-centric or example-centric mindset.</description>

      <title>Epidemiology-informed Network for Robust Rumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of rumors on social media has posed significant challenges to maintaining public trust and information integrity. Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths.</description>

      <title>Towards Identity-Aware Cross-Modal Retrieval: a Dataset and a Baseline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced content-based retrieval methods, notably through models like CLIP that map images and texts into a shared embedding space. However, these methods often struggle with domain-specific entities and long-tail concepts absent from their training data, particularly in identifying specific individuals. In this paper, we explore the task of identity-aware cross-modal retrieval, which aims to retrieve images of persons in specific contexts based on natural language queries. This task is critical in various scenarios, such as for searching and browsing personalized video collections or large audio-visual archives maintained by national broadcasters. We introduce a novel dataset, COCO Person FaceSwap (COCO-PFS), derived from the widely used COCO dataset and enriched with deepfake-generated faces from VGGFace2. This dataset addresses the lack of large-scale datasets needed for training and evaluating models for this task. Our experiments assess the performance of different CLIP variations repurposed for this task, including our architecture, Identity-aware CLIP (Id-CLIP), which achieves competitive retrieval performance through targeted fine-tuning. Our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust cross-modal retrieval systems capable of recognizing long-tail identities and contextual nuances.

      <title>TACLR: A Scalable and Efficient Retrieval-based Method for Industrial Product Attribute Value Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying attribute values from product profiles, a key task for improving product search, recommendations, and business analytics on e-commerce platforms. However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as inferring implicit values, handling out-of-distribution (OOD) values, and producing normalized outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Taxonomy-Aware Contrastive Learning Retrieval (TACLR), the first retrieval-based method for PAVI. TACLR formulates PAVI as an information retrieval task by encoding product profiles and candidate values into embeddings and retrieving values based on their similarity to the item embedding. It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds. TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial scenarios. Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR. Moreover, it has been successfully deployed in a real-world e-commerce platform, processing millions of product listings daily while supporting dynamic, large-scale attribute taxonomies.</description>

      <title>LemmaHead: RAG Assisted Proof Generation Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15797v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing the logic necessary to solve mathematical problems or write mathematical proofs is one of the more difficult objectives for large language models (LLMS). Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</description>
