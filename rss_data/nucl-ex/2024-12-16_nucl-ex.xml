      <title>Measurements of global and local spin polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ in Au+Au collisions from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurements of $\Lambda$ hyperons' global and local spin polarization from second phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 7.7--27 GeV. Global polarization measurements of $\bar{\Lambda}$ and $\Lambda$ show no significant differences, offering insights into the late-stage evolution of the magnetic field. The new measurements of the local polarization of $\Lambda$ perpendicular to the reaction plane ($\langle P_{2,y} \rangle$) shows a monotonic increase with decreasing collision energy, while the component along the beam direction ($\langle P_{2,z} \rangle$) for both $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ is small in magnitude with no strong energy dependence. The net local polarization observable, $\langle P_{2,y}^{net} \rangle =\langle P_{2,y}(\Lambda) \rangle - \langle P_{2,y}(\bar{\Lambda})\rangle$ and $\langle P_{2,z}^{net} \rangle = \langle P_{2,z}(\Lambda) \rangle - \langle P_{2,z}(\bar{\Lambda} \rangle)$ designed to probe baryonic spin Hall effect, is consistent with zero with large uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Staking out the Proton Drip-Line of Thulium at the N=82 Shell Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct observation of proton emission with very small emission energy is often unfeasible due to the long partial half-lives associated with tunneling through the Coulomb barrier. Therefore proton emitters with very small Q-values may require masses of both parent and daughter nuclei to establish them as proton unbound. Nuclear mass models have been used to predict the proton drip-line of the thulium (Tm) isotopic chain ($Z=69$), but up until now the proton separation energy has not been experimentally tested. Mass measurements were therefore performed using a Multiple Reflection Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (MR-TOF-MS) at TRIUMF's TITAN facility to definitively map the limit of proton-bound Tm. The masses of neutron-deficient, $^{149}$Tm and $^{150}$Tm, combined with measurements of $^{149m,g}$Er (which were found to deviate from literature by $\sim$150 keV), provide the first experimental confirmation that $^{149}$Tm is the first proton-unbound nuclide in the Tm chain. Our measurements also enable the strength of the $N=82$ neutron shell gap to be determined at the Tm proton drip-line, providing evidence supporting its continued existence.</description>

      <title>Study of the energy spectrum of alpha particles in an experiment on irradiation of a boron target with a proton beam at the Prometheus accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of alpha particles from the nuclear reaction p + $^{11}$B $\rightarrow 3\alpha$ was studied using the beam of the injector of the proton synchrotron of the Prometheus proton therapy complex. The reaction products (alpha particles) were recorded using a CR-39 track detector. The detectors were calibrated using a $^{241}$Am radioactive source. It was determined that mainly alpha particles emitted from the boron target have energies from 3 to 5.5 MeV. In this case, a significant part of the alpha particles emitted from the depths of the target have significantly lower energies compared to the calculated ones due to ionization losses. Measuring the energy spectrum of alpha particles from targets containing boron is of great scientific and practical interest for identifying the mechanisms of boron-proton capture therapy and determining the additional contribution to the therapeutic effect of proton irradiation.</description>

      <title>Effective temperatures of the QGP from thermal photon and dilepton production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal electromagnetic radiation is emitted by the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) throughout its space-time evolution, with production rates that depend characteristically on the temperature. We study this temperature using thermal photons and dileptons using the Trajectum heavy ion code, which is constrained by Bayesian analysis. In addition we present the elliptic flow of both the thermal photons and thermal dileptons including systematic uncertainties corresponding to the model parameter uncertainty. We give a comprehensive overview of the resulting effective temperatures $T_{\rm eff}$, obtained from thermal photon transverse momentum and thermal dilepton invariant mass distributions, as well as the dependence of $T_{\rm eff}$ on various selection criteria of these probes. We conclude that the $T_{\rm eff}$ obtained from thermal photons is mostly insensitive to the temperature of the QGP with a value of $T_{\rm eff} \sim$ 250-300 MeV depending on their transverse momentum, almost independent of collision centrality. Thermal dileptons are much better probes of the QGP temperature as they do not suffer from a blue shift as their invariant mass is used, allowing for a more precise constraint of the QGP temperature during different stages of the evolution of the system. By applying selection criteria on the dilepton transverse momentum and the invariant mass we are able to extract fluid temperatures on average times ranging from late emission ($\langle \tau \rangle = 5.6\,$fm$/c$) to very early emissions ($\langle \tau \rangle &lt; 1.0\,$fm$/c$). Furthermore, we show how these selection criteria can be used to map the elliptic flow of the system all throughout its evolution.</description>

      <title>Towards a foundation model for heavy-ion collision experiments through point cloud diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel point cloud diffusion model for relativistic heavy-ion collisions, capable of ultra-fast generation of event-by-event collision output, is introduced. When trained on UrQMD cascade simulations, the model generates realistic collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species, as a list of particle momentum vectors along with their particle ID. From solving inverse problems to accelerating model calculations or detector simulations, the model can be a promising general purpose tool for heavy-ion collisions beneficial to both theoretical studies and experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Imaging the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions and nuclear structure across the nuclide chart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11042v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions encompass three key stages: the structure of the colliding nuclei informed by low-energy nuclear physics, the initial condition (IC) leading to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and the hydrodynamic expansion and hadronization of the QGP leading to final-state hadrons observed experimentally. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical methods have ushered in a precision era, enabling an increasingly accurate understanding of these stages. However, most approaches involve simultaneously determining both QGP properties and initial conditions from a single collision system, creating complexity due to the coupled contributions of various stages to the final-state observables.
  To avoid this, we propose leveraging known knowledge of low-energy nuclear structure and hydrodynamic observables to constrain the IC independently. By conducting comparative studies of collisions involving isobar-like nuclei - species with similar mass numbers but different structures - we disentangle the initial condition's impacts from the QGP properties. This approach not only refines our understanding of the IC but also turns high-energy experiments into a precision tool for imaging nuclear structures, offering insights that complement traditional low-energy approaches.
  Opportunities for carrying out such comparative experiments at the LHC and other facilities could significantly advance both high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics. Additionally, this approach has implications for the future EIC. While the possibilities are extensive, we focus on selected proposals that could benefit both the high-energy and low-energy nuclear physics communities. Originally prepared as input for the long-range plan of U.S. nuclear physics, this white paper reflects the status as of September 2022, with a brief update on developments since then.</description>

      <title>Larmor Power Limit for Cyclotron Radiation of Relativistic Particles in a Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES) is a modern technique for high-precision energy spectroscopy, in which the energy of a charged particle in a magnetic field is measured via the frequency of the emitted cyclotron radiation. The He6-CRES collaboration aims to use CRES to probe beyond the standard model physics at the TeV scale by performing high-resolution and low-background beta-decay spectroscopy of ${}^6\textrm{He}$ and ${}^{19}\textrm{Ne}$. Having demonstrated the first observation of individual, high-energy (0.1 -- 2.5 MeV) positrons and electrons via their cyclotron radiation, the experiment provides a novel window into the radiation of relativistic charged particles in a waveguide via the time-derivative (slope) of the cyclotron radiation frequency, $\mathrm{d}f_\textrm{c}/\mathrm{d}t$. We show that analytic predictions for the total cyclotron radiation power emitted by a charged particle in circular and rectangular waveguides are approximately consistent with the Larmor formula, each scaling with the Lorentz factor of the underlying $e^\pm$ as $\gamma^4$. This hypothesis is corroborated with experimental CRES slope data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the excitation function of HBT radii for L\'evy-stable sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary heavy-ion physics research aims to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter and search for signs of the possible critical endpoint on the QCD phase diagram. Femtoscopy is among the important tools used for this endeavor; there have been indications that combinations of femtoscopic radii parameters (referred to as HBT radii for identical boson pairs) can be related to the system's emission duration. An apparent non-monotonic behavior in their excitation function thus might signal the location of the critical point. In this paper, we show that conclusions drawn from the results obtained with a Gaussian approximation for the pion source shape might be altered if one utilizes a more general L\'evy-stable source description. We find that the characteristic size of the pion source function is strongly connected to the shape of the source and its possible power-law behavior. Taking this into account properly changes the observed behavior of the excitation function.</description>
