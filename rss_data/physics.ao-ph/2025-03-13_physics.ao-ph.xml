      <title>Predicting Tropical Cyclone Track Forecast Errors using a Probabilistic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method for estimating tropical cyclone track uncertainty is presented and tested. This method uses a neural network to predict a bivariate normal distribution, which serves as an estimate for track uncertainty. We train the network and make predictions on forecasts from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), which currently uses static error distributions based on forecasts from the past five years for most applications. The neural network-based method produces uncertainty estimates that are dynamic and probabilistic. Further, the neural network-based method allows for probabilistic statements about tropical cyclone trajectories, including landfall probability, which we highlight. We show that our predictions are well calibrated using multiple metrics, that our method produces better uncertainty estimates than current NHC approaches, and that our method achieves similar performance to the Global Ensemble Forecast System. Once trained, the computational cost of predictions using this method is negligible, making it a strong candidate to improve the NHC's operational estimations of tropical cyclone track uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Advanced Ocean Reanalysis of the Northwestern Atlantic: 1993-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 30-year high-resolution Northwestern Atlantic Ocean Reanalysis (NAOR) is presented. NAOR spans from January 1993 to December 2022 with a 4 km horizontal resolution and 50 vertical layers. It provides enhanced resolution and expands the spatial and temporal coverage of existing ocean reanalysis in the region. NAOR was conducted using the Regional Ocean Modeling System along with Ensemble Optimal Interpolation data assimilation. Open boundary and surface forcing conditions were obtained from GLORYS global ocean reanalysis and ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. Multiple sources of satellite and in-situ observations were incorporated through the data assimilation. Additionally, major rivers were accounted for to include freshwater riverine discharge. NAOR was extensively evaluated against available independent observations. Spatio-temporal variations of mesoscale circulation, eddies, and boundary currents are well captured. Compared to GLORYS, NAOR offers a more accurate physical and dynamic baseline of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, which can be utilized for a range of marine and environmental studies as well as climate impact research.</description>
