      <title>Cluster percolation in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on extensive parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the relationship between cluster percolation and equilibrium ordering phenomena in the three-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model as one varies the fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds. We consider a range of cluster definitions, most of which are constructed in the space of overlaps between two independent real replicas of the system. In the pure ferromagnet that is contained as a limiting case in the class of problems considered, the relevant percolation point coincides with the thermodynamic ordering transition. For the disordered ferromagnet encountered first on introducing antiferromagnetic bonds and the adjacent spin-glass phase of strong disorder this connection is altered, and one finds a percolation transition above the thermodynamic ordering point that is accompanied by the appearance of /two/ percolating clusters of equal density. Only at the lower (disordered) ferromagnetic or spin-glass transition points the densities of these two clusters start to diverge, thus providing a percolation signature of these thermodynamic transitions. We compare the scaling behavior at this secondary percolation transition with the thermodynamic behavior at the corresponding ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Validation of Replica Symmetry Breaking via Quantum Annealing: From Ground States to Topological Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 &lt; D_c &lt; 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Machine learning intermolecular transfer integrals with compact atomic cluster representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating intermolecular charge transfer integrals in organic semiconductors requires substantial computer resource for each individual calculation. We might alternatively construct a machine learning model for transfer integrals, which model the full six-degrees of freedom for the relative position of dimer pairs, trained on representative calculations for the molecules of interest. Recent developments have produced effective machine learning force fields, which model the total energy of atomic assemblies. We extend the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) with the correct symmetries for transfer (kinetic-energy) integrals. Combined with a spherical harmonic basis makes, this forms a strong inductive bias and makes for a data efficient model. We introduce coarse-grained and heavy-atom representations, and assess the methodology on representative conjugated semiconductors: ethylene, thiophene, and naphthalene.</description>

      <title>Tunable phononic transparency and opacity with isotopic defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an isotopically disordered harmonic chain, phonon transmission attenuates exponentially with distance because of multiple scattering by the isotopic defects. We propose a simple method, which is based on the static structure factor, for arranging the isotopic defects to suppress or enhance phonon scattering within a targeted frequency window, resulting in maximization or minimization of phonon transmission. The phononic transparency and opacity effects are demonstrated numerically from the frequency dependence of the transmission coefficient. We briefly discuss how the underlying concept can be extended to the design of aperiodic superlattices to improve or block phononic transmission.</description>

      <title>Weakly universal dynamical correlations between eigenvalues of large random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was shown roughly thirty years ago that the density correlations of eigenvalues of large random matrices display a universal form, independent of most of the details of the distribution of the random matrix itself. We show that when the matrix elements evolve according to a Dyson Brownian motion, dynamical correlations retain a large degree of the universality found at equal times when expressed in terms of the characteristics of some partial differential equation in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Excitation spectrum and low-temperature magnetism in disordered defect-fluorite Ho2Zr2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report on the thermomagnetic characterization and crystalline-electric field (CEF) energy scheme of the disordered defect-fluorite Ho2Zr2O7. This structural phase is distinguished by the coexistence of magnetic frustration and extensive disorder, with Ho3+ and Zr4+ sharing randomly the same 4a site with even 50% occupancy, and an average 1/8 oxygen vacancy per unit cell. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements performed on powder samples down to 0.5 K revealed signs of slowing spin dynamics without glassy behavior, including a frequency dependent peak at 1 K. Yet, no evidence for long-range magnetic order is found down to 150 mK in specific heat. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements show a weak, low-lying CEF excitation around 2 meV, accompanied by a broad level centered at 60 meV. To fit our observations, we propose an approach to account for structural disorder in the crystal-field splitting of the non-Kramers Ho3+. Our model provides an explanation to the broadening of the high-energy, single-ion excitations and suggests that the zirconate ground-state wave function has zero magnetic moment. However, structural disorder acts as guarantor of the magnetism in Ho2Zr2O7, allowing the mixing of low lying states at finite temperatures. Finally, we show that this scenario is in good agreement with the bulk properties reported in this work.</description>

      <title>Average Winding Number for Determinantal Curves associated to 2-Matrix Models in the Class AIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To classify one-dimensional disordered quantum systems with chiral symmetry, we analyse the winding number of the determinant of a parametrized non-Hermitian random matrix field over the unit circle modelling the off-diagonal block of a disordered chiral Hamiltonian. The associated partition function is computed explicitly for a broad class of additive two-matrix models extending beyond the Ginibre Unitary Ensemble. In the large-dimension limit, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the average winding number whose leading term exhibits universal features, up to the tail behaviour of the underlying random matrix ensemble, and identify a new correction term absent in the previously studied Ginibre case.</description>

      <title>Emergent self-inhibition governs the landscape of stable states in complex ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species-rich ecosystems often exhibit multiple stable states with distinct species compositions. Yet, the factors determining the likelihood of each state's occurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize and explain the landscape of stable states in the random Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, in which multistability is widespread. We find that the same pool of species with random initial abundances can result in different stable states, whose likelihoods typically differ by orders of magnitude. A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely. These results reveal emergent self-inhibition as a fundamental organizing principle for the attractor landscape of complex ecosystems - and provide a path to predict ecosystem outcomes without knowing microscopic interactions.</description>

      <title>Roughness and critical force for depinning at 3-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional elastic manifold at depinning is described by a renormalized field theory, based on the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG). Here we analyze this theory to 3-loop order, equivalent to third order in $\epsilon=4-d$, where $d$ is the internal dimension. The critical exponent reads $\zeta = \frac \epsilon3 + 0.04777 \epsilon^2 -0.068354 \epsilon^3 + {\cal O}(\epsilon^4)$. Using that $\zeta(d=0)=2^-$, we estimate $\zeta(d=1)=1.266(20)$, $\zeta(d=2)=0.752(1)$ and $\zeta(d=3)=0.357(1)$. For Gaussian disorder, the pinning force per site is estimated as $f_{\rm c}= {\cal B} m^{2}\rho_m + f_{\rm c}^0$, where $m^2$ is the strength of the confining potential, $\cal B$ a universal amplitude, $\rho_m$ the correlation length of the disorder, and $f_{\rm c}^0$ a non-universal lattice dependent term. For charge-density waves, we find a mapping to the standard $\phi^4$-theory with $O(n)$ symmetry in the limit of $n\to -2$. This gives $f_{\rm c} = \tilde {\cal A}(d) m^2 \ln (m) + f_{\rm c}^0 $, with $\tilde {\cal A}(d) = -\partial_n \big[\nu(d,n)^{-1}+\eta(d,n)\big]_{n=-2}$, reminiscent of log-CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered systems generically exhibit aging and a glass transition. Previous studies have long suggested that non-reciprocity tends to destroy glassiness. Here, we show that this is not always the case using a bipartite spherical Sherrington-Kirpatrick model that describes the antagonistic coupling between two identical complex agents modeled as macroscopic spin glasses. Our dynamical mean field theory calculations reveal an exceptional-point mediated transition from a static disorder phase to an oscillating amorphous phase as well as non-reciprocal aging with slow dynamics and oscillations.</description>

      <title>Large-scale exponential correlations of nonaffine elastic response of strongly disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlation properties of nonaffine elastic response in strongly disordered materials are investigated using the theory of correlated random matrices and numerical models. The random matrix theory shows that the divergence of the nonaffine displacement field has large-scale exponentially decaying correlations. The corresponding length scale $\xi$ is determined by the strength of the disorder and can be indefinitely large, significantly exceeding the correlation length of the disorder. The rotor of the nonaffine displacement field has the same length scale $\xi$ except the case of the volumetric deformation. The main theoretical dependencies are confirmed by the numerical investigation of the rigidity percolation model and the molecular dynamics simulations of a model polystyrene in the amorphous state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of the Ising spin glass in five spatial dimensions through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors are extensively studied for applications ranging from bioelectronics to analog and neuromorphic computing. Despite significant advances, the fundamental interactions between the polymer semiconductor channel and the electrolyte, which critically determine the device performance, remain underexplored. Here, we examine the coupling between the benchmark semiconductor PEDOT:PSS and an ionic liquid to explain the bistable and non-volatile behavior observed in OECTs. Using X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques, we demonstrate how the electrolyte modifies the channel composition, enhances molecular order, and reshapes the energetic landscape. Notably, the observed bistability arises from asymmetric and path-dependent energetics during doping and dedoping, resulting in two distinct paths, driven by a direct interaction between the electronic and ionic charge carriers. These findings highlight the electrolyte's role in tuning charge carrier dynamics, positioning it as a powerful yet underutilized lever for enabling novel device functionalities.</description>

      <title>Minimalistic and Scalable Quantum Reservoir Computing Enhanced with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing as few as five atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurement. The system is conveniently scalable, as newly added atoms naturally couple with existing ones via the shared cavity field. To achieve high computational expressivity with a minimal reservoir, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its internal quantum hardware, while polynomial regression nonlinearly enhances output resolution. We demonstrate significant QRC performance in memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</description>

      <title>A solvable model of learning generative diffusion: theory and insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider the problem of learning a flow or diffusion-based generative model parametrized by a two-layer auto-encoder, trained with online stochastic gradient descent, on a high-dimensional target density with an underlying low-dimensional manifold structure. We derive a tight asymptotic characterization of low-dimensional projections of the distribution of samples generated by the learned model, ascertaining in particular its dependence on the number of training samples. Building on this analysis, we discuss how mode collapse can arise, and lead to model collapse when the generative model is re-trained on generated synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Self-consistency error correction for accurate machine learning potentials from variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) can be used to train accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex materials on time scales and for system sizes previously unattainable. VMC training sets are often based on partially optimized wave functions (WFs) to circumvent expensive energy optimizations of the whole set of WF parameters. However, frozen variational parameters lead to VMC forces and pressures not consistent with the underlying potential energy surface, a bias called the self-consistency error (SCE). Here, we demonstrate how the SCE can spoil the accuracy of MLIPs trained on these data, taking high-pressure hydrogen as test case. We then apply a recently introduced SCE correction [ Phys. Rev. B 109, 205151 (2024)] to generate unbiased VMC training sets based on a Jastrow-correlated single determinant WF with frozen Kohn-Sham orbitals. The MLIPs generated within this framework are significantly improved and can approach in quality those trained on datasets built with fully optimized WFs. Our conclusions are further supported by MD simulations, which show how MLIPs trained on SCE-corrected datasets systematically yield more reliable physical observables. Our framework opens the possibility of constructing extended high-quality training sets with VMC.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation</title>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic viscous liquid dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When liquids are cooled, their dynamics are slowed, and if crystallization is avoided, they will solidify into an amorphous structure referred to as a glass. Experiments show that chemically distinct glass-forming liquids have universal features of the spectrum and temperature dependence of the main structural relaxation. We introduce Randium, a generic energetically coarse-grained model of viscous liquids, and demonstrate that the intrinsic dynamics of viscous liquids emerges. These results suggest that Randium belongs to a universal class of systems whose dynamics capture the essential physics of viscous liquid relaxation, bridging microscopic molecular models and coarse-grained theoretical descriptions.</description>
