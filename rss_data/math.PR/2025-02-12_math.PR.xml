      <title>Riemann-Skorohod and Stratonovich integrals for Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider Skorohod and Stratonovich-type integrals in a general setting of Gaussian processes. We show that a conversion formula holds when the covariance functions of the Gaussian process are of finite $\rho$-variation for $\rho\geq 1$ and that the diagonals of covariance functions are of finite $\rho'$-variation for $\rho'\geq 1$ such that $\frac{1}{\rho'}+\frac{1}{2\rho}&gt;1$. The difference between the two types of integrals is identified with a Young integral. We also show that the Skorohod integral is the limit of a $[\rho]$-th order Skorohod-Riemann sum.</description>

      <title>Limit distributions for cycles of random parking functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of cycles of uniformly random parking functions. Our results are multifold: we obtain an explicit formula for the number of parking functions with a prescribed number of cyclic points and show that the scaled number of cyclic points of a random parking function is asymptotically Rayleigh distributed; we establish the classical trio of limit theorems (law of large numbers, central limit theorem, large deviation principle) for the number of cycles in a random parking function; we also compute the asymptotic mean of the length of the $r$th longest cycle in a random parking function for all valid $r$. A variety of tools from probability theory and combinatorics are used in our investigation. Corresponding results for the class of prime parking functions are obtained.</description>

      <title>Moderate deviation principles for stochastic 2D hydrodynamics type systems with multiplicative L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a moderate deviation principle for an abstract nonlinear equation forced by random noise of L\'evy type. This type of equation covers many hydrodynamical models, including stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations, stochastic 2D MHD equations, the stochastic 2D magnetic B\'ernard problem, and also several stochastic shell models of turbulence. This paper gets rid of the compact embedding assumption on the associated Gelfand triple. The weak convergence method plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Free Field and Discrete Gaussians in Periodic Dimer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze height fluctuations in Aztec diamond dimer models with nearly arbitrary periodic edge weights. We show that the centered height function approximates the sum of two independent components: a Gaussian free field on the multiply connected liquid region and a harmonic function with random liquid-gas boundary values. The boundary values are jointly distributed as a discrete Gaussian random vector. This discrete Gaussian distribution maintains a quasi-periodic dependence on $N$, a phenomenon also observed in multi-cut random matrix models.</description>

      <title>On a Fractional Variant of Linear Birth-Death Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a fractional variant of the linear birth-death process, namely, the generalized fractional linear birth-death process (GFLBDP) which is defined by taking the regularized Hilfer-Prabhakar derivative in the system of differential equations that governs the state probabilities of linear birth-death process. For a particular choice of parameters, the GFLBDP reduces to the fractional linear birth-death process that involves the Caputo derivative. Its time-changed representation is obtained and utilized to derive the explicit expressions of its state probabilities. The explicit expressions for its mean and variance are derived. In a particular case, it is observed that the limiting distribution of the time changing process coincides to that of an inverse stable subordinator. A relation between the extinction probability of GFLBDP and the density of inter arrival times of a generalized fractional Poisson process is obtained. Later, we study some integrals of the GFLBDP and discuss the asymptotic distributional characteristics for a particular integral process. Also, an application of the path integral at random time to a genetic population with an upper bound is discussed.</description>

      <title>Biased branching random walks on Bienaym\'e--Galton--Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\lambda$-biased branching random walks on Bienaym\'e--Galton--Watson trees in discrete time. We consider the maximal displacement at time $n$, $\max_{\vert u \vert =n} \vert X(u) \vert$, and show that it almost surely grows at a deterministic, linear speed. We characterize this speed with the help of the large deviation rate function of the $\lambda$-biased random walk of a single particle. A similar result is given for the minimal displacement at time $n$, $\min_{\vert u \vert =n} \vert X(u) \vert$.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of the M&amp;M Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M&amp;M Game was created to help young kids explore probability by modeling a response to the question: \emph{If two people are born on the same day, will they die on the same day?} Each player starts with a fixed number of M&amp;M's and a fair coin; a turn consists of players simultaneously tossing their coin and eating an M&amp;M only if the toss is a head, with a person ``dying'' when they have eaten their stash. The probability of a tie can naturally be written as an infinite sum of binomial products, and can be reformulated into a finite calculation using memoryless processes, recursion theory, or graph-theoretic techniques, highlighting its value as an educational game. We analyze several extensions, such as tossing multiple coins with varying probabilities and evolving probability distributions for coin flips. We derive formulas for the expected length of the game and the probability of a tie by modeling the number of rounds as a sum of geometric waiting times.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures : Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06862v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandomness Properties of Random Reversible Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by practical concerns in cryptography, we study pseudorandomness properties of permutations on $\{0,1\}^n$ computed by random circuits made from reversible $3$-bit gates (permutations on $\{0,1\}^3$). Our main result is that a random circuit of depth $\sqrt{n} \cdot \tilde{O}(k^3)$, with each layer consisting of $\Theta(n)$ random gates in a fixed two-dimensional nearest-neighbor architecture, yields approximate $k$-wise independent permutations.
  Our result can be seen as a particularly simple/practical block cipher construction that gives provable statistical security against attackers with access to $k$~input-output pairs within few rounds.
  The main technical component of our proof consists of two parts:
  1. We show that the Markov chain on $k$-tuples of $n$-bit strings induced by a single random $3$-bit one-dimensional nearest-neighbor gate has spectral gap at least $1/n \cdot \tilde{O}(k)$. Then we infer that a random circuit with layers of random gates in a fixed one-dimensional gate architecture yields approximate $k$-wise independent permutations of $\{0,1\}^n$ in depth $n\cdot \tilde{O}(k^2)$
  2. We show that if the $n$ wires are layed out on a two-dimensional lattice of bits, then repeatedly alternating applications of approximate $k$-wise independent permutations of $\{0,1\}^{\sqrt n}$ to the rows and columns of the lattice yields an approximate $k$-wise independent permutation of $\{0,1\}^n$ in small depth.
  Our work improves on the original work of Gowers, who showed a gap of $1/\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ for one random gate (with non-neighboring inputs); and, on subsequent work improving the gap to $\Omega(1/n^2k)$ in the same setting.</description>

      <title>Negative Dependence as a toolbox for machine learning : review and new developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative dependence is becoming a key driver in advancing learning capabilities beyond the limits of traditional independence. Recent developments have evidenced support towards negatively dependent systems as a learning paradigm in a broad range of fundamental machine learning challenges including optimization, sampling, dimensionality reduction and sparse signal recovery, often surpassing the performance of current methods based on statistical independence. The most popular negatively dependent model has been that of determinantal point processes (DPPs), which have their origins in quantum theory. However, other models, such as perturbed lattice models, strongly Rayleigh measures, zeros of random functions have gained salience in various learning applications. In this article, we review this burgeoning field of research, as it has developed over the past two decades or so. We also present new results on applications of DPPs to the parsimonious representation of neural networks. In the limited scope of the article, we mostly focus on aspects of this area to which the authors contributed over the recent years, including applications to Monte Carlo methods, coresets and stochastic gradient descent, stochastic networks, signal processing and connections to quantum computation. However, starting from basics of negative dependence for the uninitiated reader, extensive references are provided to a broad swath of related developments which could not be covered within our limited scope. While existing works and reviews generally focus on specific negatively dependent models (e.g. DPPs), a notable feature of this article is that it addresses negative dependence as a machine learning methodology as a whole. In this vein, it covers within its span an array of negatively dependent models and their applications well beyond DPPs, thereby putting forward a very general and rather unique perspective.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory: A Mathematical Foundation for Coarse Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ethical decision-making, individuals are often evaluated based on generalized assessments rather than precise individual performance. This concept, known as Coarse Ethics (CE), has primarily been discussed in natural language without a formal mathematical foundation. This paper introduces Coarse Set Theory (CST) to establish a mathematical framework for CE. We define coarse sets using totally ordered sets and propose axioms that characterize the hierarchical relationships between elements and their groupings. Additionally, we introduce coarse-grained sets, which partition an underlying set into equivalence classes based on predefined criteria. We extend this framework by defining coarse mappings, which transform detailed individual data into coarser representations while maintaining essential structural properties. To measure the information loss, we employ Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, demonstrating how different coarse partitions affect the preservation of information. We illustrate how CST can be applied to real-world grading systems through theoretical formulations and empirical analysis. This study provides a rigorous foundation for CE, enabling a more systematic exploration of fairness, interpretability, and decision-making trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Private Low-Rank Approximation for Covariance Matrices, Dyson Brownian Motion, and Eigenvalue-Gap Bounds for Gaussian Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a $d \times d$ covariance matrix $M$ with a rank-$k$ matrix under $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. We present and analyze a complex variant of the Gaussian mechanism and obtain upper bounds on the Frobenius norm of the difference between the matrix output by this mechanism and the best rank-$k$ approximation to $M$. Our analysis provides improvements over previous bounds, particularly when the spectrum of $M$ satisfies natural structural assumptions. The novel insight is to view the addition of Gaussian noise to a matrix as a continuous-time matrix Brownian motion. This viewpoint allows us to track the evolution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix, which are governed by stochastic differential equations discovered by Dyson. These equations enable us to upper bound the Frobenius distance between the best rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ and that of a Gaussian perturbation of $M$ as an integral that involves inverse eigenvalue gaps of the stochastically evolving matrix, as opposed to a sum of perturbation bounds obtained via Davis-Kahan-type theorems. Subsequently, again using the Dyson Brownian motion viewpoint, we show that the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$ perturbed by Gaussian noise have large gaps with high probability. These results also contribute to the analysis of low-rank approximations under average-case perturbations, and to an understanding of eigenvalue gaps for random matrices, both of which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sharp Anti-Concentration Inequalities for Extremum Statistics via Copulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive sharp upper and lower bounds for the pointwise concentration function of the maximum statistic of $d$ identically distributed real-valued random variables. Our first main result places no restrictions either on the common marginal law of the samples or on the copula describing their joint distribution. We show that, in general, strictly sublinear dependence of the concentration function on the dimension $d$ is not possible. We then introduce a new class of copulas, namely those with a convex diagonal section, and demonstrate that restricting to this class yields a sharper upper bound on the concentration function. This allows us to establish several new dimension-independent and poly-logarithmic-in-$d$ anti-concentration inequalities for a variety of marginal distributions under mild dependence assumptions. Our theory improves upon the best known results in certain special cases. Applications to high-dimensional statistical inference are presented, including a specific example pertaining to Gaussian mixture approximations for factor models, for which our main results lead to superior distributional guarantees.</description>

Abstract: We prove an asymptotic formula for the partition function of a 2d Coulomb gas at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ confined to lie on a Jordan curve. This also gives a central limit theorem for a linear statistic of the particles in the gas. We obtain different expressions for the asymptotic mean and variance which involve either the exterior conformal mapping of the curve or the Grunsky operator.</description>

      <title>Extreme local statistics in random graphs: maximum tree extension counts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider maximum rooted tree extension counts in random graphs, i.e., we consider M_n = \max_v X_v where X_v counts the number of copies of a given tree in G_{n,p} rooted at vertex v. We determine the asymptotics of M_n when the random graph is not too sparse, specifically when the edge probability p=p(n) satisfies p(1-p)n \gg \log n. The problem is more difficult in the sparser regime 1 \ll pn \ll \log n, where we determine the asymptotics of M_n for specific classes of trees. Interestingly, here our large deviation type optimization arguments reveal that the behavior of M_n changes as we vary p=p(n), due to different mechanisms that can make the maximum large.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of random matrices $\boldsymbol{X}^N=(X_1^N,\ldots,X_d^N)$ is said to converge strongly to a family of bounded operators $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ when $\|P(\boldsymbol{X}^N,\boldsymbol{X}^{N*})\|\to\|P(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}^*)\|$ for every noncommutative polynomial $P$. This phenomenon plays a key role in several recent breakthroughs on random graphs, geometry, and operator algebras. However, proofs of strong convergence are notoriously delicate and have relied largely on problem-specific methods.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strong convergence that uses only soft arguments. Our method exploits the fact that for many natural models, the expected trace of $P(\boldsymbol{X}^N,\boldsymbol{X}^{N*})$ is a rational function of $\frac{1}{N}$ whose lowest order asymptotics are easily understood. We develop a general technique to deduce strong convergence directly from these inputs using the inequality of A. and V. Markov for univariate polynomials and elementary Fourier analysis. To illustrate the method, we develop the following applications.
  1. We give a short proof of the result of Friedman that random regular graphs have a near-optimal spectral gap, and obtain a sharp understanding of the large deviations probabilities of the second eigenvalue.
  2. We prove a strong quantitative form of the strong convergence property of random permutation matrices due to Bordenave and Collins.
  3. We extend the above to any stable representation of the symmetric group, providing many new examples of the strong convergence phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Geometric Martingale Benamou-Brenier transport and geometric Bass martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study geometric Bass martingales. Bass martingales were introduced in \cite{Ba83} and studied recently in a series of works, including \cite{BaBeHuKa20,BaBeScTs23}, where they appear as solutions to the martingale version of the Benamou-Brenier optimal transport formulation. These arithmetic, as well as our novel geometric, Bass martingales are continuous martingale on $[0,1]$ with prescribed initial and terminal distributions. An arithmetic Bass martingale is the one closest to Brownian motion: its quadratic variation is as close as possible to being linear in the averaged $L^2$ sense. Its geometric counterpart we develop here, is the one closest to a geometric Brownian motion: the quadratic variation of its logarithm is as close as possible to being linear. By analogy between Bachelier and Black-Scholes models in mathematical finance, the newly obtained geometric Bass martingales} have the potential to be of more practical importance in a number of applications.
  Our main contribution is to exhibit an explicit bijection between geometric Bass martingales and their arithmetic counterparts. This allows us, in particular, to translate fine properties of the latter into the new geometric setting. We obtain an explicit representation for a geometric Bass martingale for given initial and terminal marginals, we characterise it as a solution to an SDE, and we show that geometric Brownian motion is the only process which is both an arithmetic and a geometric Bass martingale. Finally, we deduce a dual formulation for our geometric martingale Benamou-Brenier problem. Our main proof is probabilistic in nature and uses a suitable change of measure, but we also provide PDE arguments relying on the dual formulation of the problem, which offer a rigorous proof under suitable regularity assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of log-correlated Gaussian processes indexed by metric spaces is introduced, when the metric is conditionally negative definite. These processes arise as the limit of bi-fractional Brownian motions indexed by $(H,K)$ scaled by $K^{-1/2}$ as $K\downarrow 0$ with $H\in(0,1/2]$ fixed. Stochastic-integral representations of the generalized processes when evaluated at a test function are provided. The introduced processes are also shown to be the scaling limits of certain aggregated models.</description>

      <title>The Integrable Snake Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pure snake configuration is a bijection $\sigma:\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ containing no two-cycles and such that for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ we have $\sigma(x) \in \{ x , x+ \mathbf{e}^1, x+\mathbf{e}^2 , x- \mathbf{e}^2 \}.$ The non-trivial cycles of a pure snake configuration may be regarded as a collection of non-intersecting paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that may travel right, up, or down (but not left) from a given vertex. Pure snake configurations are a generalisation of lozenge tilings, which are in natural correspondence with paths that only travel right or up. We introduce a natural partition function on a finite version of this model, and study the probabilistic properties of random pure snake configurations chosen according to their contribution to this partition function. Under a suitable weighting, the model is integrable in the sense that we have access to explicit formulas for its partition and correlation functions. We utilise the integrable structure of this model in various applications, such as to prove a traffic representation of ASEP on the ring, generalising the analogous result for TASEP by the first author.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified approach to establish the uniqueness of generalized conformal restriction measures with central charge $c \in (0, 1]$ in both chordal and radial cases, by relating these measures to the Brownian loop soup. Our method also applies to the uniqueness of the Malliavin-Kontsevich-Suhov loop measures for $c \in (0,1]$, which was recently obtained in [Baverez-Jego, arXiv:2407.09080] for all $c \leq 1$ through deep algebraic structures of SLE loop measures. In contrast, though only valid for $c \in (0,1]$, our proof is significantly simpler, as it directly links natural quantities of MKS measures to loop-soup observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a "switching identity" that can be stated for critical Brownian loop-soups or for the Gaussian free field on a cable graph: It basically says that at the level of cluster configurations and at the more general level of the occupation time fields, conditioning two points on the cable-graph to belong to the same cluster of Brownian loops (or equivalently to the same sign-cluster of the GFF) amounts to adding a random odd number of independent Brownian excursions between these points to an otherwise unconditioned configuration. This explicit simple description of the conditional law of the clusters when a connection occurs has various direct consequences, in particular about the large scale behaviour of these sign-clusters on infinite graphs.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Non-Isotropic Random Tensors with Applications to Learning and Empirical Risk Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.04259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimension is an inherent bottleneck to some modern learning tasks, where optimization methods suffer from the size of the data. In this paper, we study non-isotropic distributions of data and develop tools that aim at reducing these dimensional costs by a dependency on an effective dimension rather than the ambient one. Based on non-asymptotic estimates of the metric entropy of ellipsoids -- that prove to generalize to infinite dimensions -- and on a chaining argument, our uniform concentration bounds involve an effective dimension instead of the global dimension, improving over existing results. We show the importance of taking advantage of non-isotropic properties in learning problems with the following applications: i) we improve state-of-the-art results in statistical preconditioning for communication-efficient distributed optimization, ii) we introduce a non-isotropic randomized smoothing for non-smooth optimization. Both applications cover a class of functions that encompasses empirical risk minization (ERM) for linear models.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions for High-Frequency Option Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a nonparametric higher-order asymptotic expansion for small-time changes of conditional characteristic functions of It\^o semimartingale increments. The asymptotics setup is of joint type: both the length of the time interval of the increment of the underlying process and the time gap between evaluating the conditional characteristic function are shrinking. The spot semimartingale characteristics of the underlying process as well as their spot semimartingale characteristics appear as leading terms in the derived asymptotic expansions. The analysis applies to a general class of It\^o semimartingales that includes in particular L\'evy-driven SDEs and time-changed L\'evy processes. The asymptotic expansion results are subsequently used to construct a test for whether volatility jumps are of finite or infinite variation. In an application to high-frequency data of options written on the S\&amp;P 500 index, we find evidence for infinite variation volatility jumps.</description>

      <title>Derivative based global sensitivity analysis and its entropic link</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variance-based Sobol' sensitivity is one of the most well-known measures in global sensitivity analysis (GSA). However, uncertainties with certain distributions, such as highly skewed distributions or those with a heavy tail, cannot be adequately characterised using the second central moment only. Entropy-based GSA can consider the entire probability density function, but its application has been limited because it is difficult to estimate. Here we present a novel derivative-based upper bound for conditional entropies, to efficiently rank uncertain variables and to work as a proxy for entropy-based total effect indices. To overcome the non-desirable issue of negativity for differential entropies as sensitivity indices, we discuss an exponentiation of the total effect entropy and its proxy. Numerical verifications demonstrate that the upper bound is tight for monotonic functions and it provides the same input variable ranking as the entropy-based indices for about three-quarters of the 1000 random functions tested. We found that the new entropy proxy performs similarly to the variance-based proxies for a river flood physics model with 8 inputs of different distributions, and these two proxies are equivalent in the special case of linear functions with Gaussian inputs. We expect the new entropy proxy to increase the variable screening power of derivative-based GSA and to complement Sobol'-indices proxy for a more diverse type of distributions.</description>

Abstract: Let $\alpha \colon \mathbb{N} \to S^1$ be the Steinhaus multiplicative function: a completely multiplicative function such that $(\alpha(p))_{p\text{ prime}}$ are i.i.d.~random variables uniformly distributed on the complex unit circle $S^1$. Helson conjectured that $\mathbb{E}|\sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)|=o(\sqrt{x})$ as $x \to \infty$, and this was solved in a strong form by Harper. We give a short proof of the conjecture using a result of Saksman and Webb on a random model for the zeta function.</description>

      <title>Basins of Attraction in Two-Player Random Ordinal Potential Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the class of two-person ordinal potential games where each player has the same number of actions $K$. Each game in this class admits at least one pure Nash equilibrium and the best-response dynamics converges to one of these pure Nash equilibria; which one depends on the starting point. So, each pure Nash equilibrium has a basin of attraction.
  We pick uniformly at random one game from this class and we study the joint distribution of the sizes of the basins of attraction. We provide an asymptotic exact value for the expected basin of attraction of each pure Nash equilibrium, when the number of actions $K$ goes to infinity.</description>
