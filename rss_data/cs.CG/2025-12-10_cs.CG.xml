      <title>Reeb Graph of Sample Thickenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Reeb graph of a thickening of points sampled from an unknown space. Our main contribution is a framework to transfer reconstruction results similar to the well-known work of Niyogi, Smale, and Weinberger to the setting of Reeb graphs. To this end, we first generalize and study the interleaving distances for Reeb graphs. We find that many of the results previously established for constructible spaces also hold for general topological spaces. We use this to show that under certain conditions for topological spaces with real-valued Lipschitz maps, the Reeb graph of a sample thickening approximates the Reeb graph of the underlying space. Finally, we provide an algorithm for computing the Reeb graph of a sample thickening.</description>

      <title>Connectivity-Preserving Cortical Surface Tetrahedralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prerequisite for many biomechanical simulation techniques is discretizing a bounded volume into a tetrahedral mesh. In certain contexts, such as cortical surface simulations, preserving input surface connectivity is critical. However, automated surface extraction often yields meshes containing self-intersections, small holes, and faulty geometry, which prevents existing constrained and unconstrained meshers from preserving this connectivity. We address this issue by developing a novel tetrahedralization method that maintains input surface connectivity in the presence of such defects. We also present a metric to quantify the preservation of surface connectivity and demonstrate that our method correctly maintains connectivity compared to existing solutions.</description>

      <title>New Constructions of SSPDs and their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\renewcommand{\Re}{\mathbb{R}}$We present a new optimal construction of a semi-separated pair decomposition (i.e., SSPD) for a set of $n$ points in $\Re^d$. In the new construction each point participates in a few pairs, and it extends easily to spaces with low doubling dimension. This is the first optimal construction with these properties.
  As an application of the new construction, for a fixed $t&gt;1$, we present a new construction of a $t$-spanner with $O(n)$ edges and maximum degree $O(\log^2 n)$ that has a separator of size $O\pth{n^{1-1/d}}$.</description>

      <title>Degenerate crossing number and signed reversal distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph drawn in the plane, the degenerate crossing number of the drawing is the number of points in the plane which are contained in the relative interior of at least two edges, where each edge is required to be drawn as a simple arc. The degenerate crossing number of a graph is the minimum degenerate crossing number among all its drawings.
  Given a drawing, cutting a neighborhood of the surface around each crossing and pasting a M\"obius band gives a non-orientable surface, on which the drawing of the graph can be extended to an embedding. From this observation, Mohar derived that the degenerate crossing number of a graph is at most its non-orientable genus, and conjectured that these quantities are equal for every graph. He also made a stronger conjecture for loopless pseudo-triangulations with a fixed embedding scheme.
  In this paper, we prove a structure theorem that allows to understand when the degenerate crossing number and non-orientable genus coincide in a large class of loopless bipartite embedding schemes. In particular, we provide a counterexample to Mohar's stronger conjecture, but show that in the vast majority of the 2-vertex cases, as well as for many bipartite graphs, Mohar's conjecture is satisfied.
  The reversal distance between two signed permutations is the minimum number of reversals that transform one permutation to the other one. If we represent the trajectory of each element of a signed permutation under successive reversals by a simple arc, we obtain a drawing of a 2-vertex embedding scheme with degenerate crossings. Our main result is proved by leveraging this connection and a classical result in genome rearrangement (the Hannenhalli--Pevzner algorithm) and can also be understood as an extension of this algorithm when the reversals do not necessarily happen in a monotone order.</description>

      <title>On computing the (exact) Fr\'echet distance with a frog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous Frechet distance between two polygonal curves is classically computed by exploring their free space diagram. Recently, Har-Peled, Raichel, and Robson [SoCG'25] proposed a radically different approach: instead of directly traversing the continuous free space, they approximate the distance by computing paths in a discrete graph derived from the discrete free space, recursively bisecting edges until the discrete distance converges to the continuous Frechet distance. They implement this so-called frog-based technique and report substantial practical speedups over the state of the art.
  We revisit the frog-based approach and address three of its limitations. First, the method does not compute the Frechet distance exactly. Second, the recursive bisection procedure only introduces the monotonicity events required to realise the Frechet distance asymptotically, that is, only in the limit. Third, the applied simplification technique is heuristic. Motivated by theoretical considerations, we develop new techniques that guarantee exactness, polynomial-time convergence, and near-optimal lossless simplifications. We provide an open-source C++ implementation of our variant.
  Our primary contribution is an extensive empirical evaluation. As expected, exact computation introduces overhead and increases the median running time. Yet, our method is often faster in the worst case, the slowest ten percent of instances, or even on average due to its convergence guarantees. More surprisingly, in our experiments, the implementation of Bringmann, Kuennemann, and Nusser [SoCG'19] consistently outperforms all frog-based approaches in practice. This appears to contrast published claims of the efficiency of the frog-based techniques. These results thereby provide nuanced perspective on frogs: highlighting both the theoretical appeal, but also the practical limitations.</description>
