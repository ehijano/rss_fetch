      <title>Combinatorial Contract Design: Recent Progress and Emerging Frontiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contract theory studies how a principal can incentivize agents to exert costly, unobservable effort through performance-based payments. While classical economic models provide elegant characterizations of optimal solutions, modern applications, ranging from online labor markets and healthcare to AI delegation and blockchain protocols, call for an algorithmic perspective. The challenge is no longer only which contracts induce desired behavior, but whether such contracts can be computed efficiently. This viewpoint has given rise to \emph{algorithmic contract design}, paralleling the rise of algorithmic mechanism design two decades ago.
  This article focuses on \emph{combinatorial contracts}, an emerging frontier within algorithmic contract design, where agents may choose among exponentially many combinations of actions, or where multiple agents must work together as a team, and the challenge lies in selecting the right composition. These models capture a wide variety of real-world contracting environments, from hospitals coordinating physicians across treatment protocols to firms hiring teams of engineers for interdependent tasks. We review three combinatorial settings: (i) a single agent choosing multiple actions, (ii) multiple agents with binary actions, and (iii) multiple agents each selecting multiple actions. For each, we highlight structural insights, algorithmic techniques, and complexity barriers. Results include tractable cases such as gross substitutes reward functions, hardness results, and approximation guarantees under value- and demand-oracle access. By charting these advances, the article maps the emerging landscape of combinatorial contract design, and highlights fundamental open questions and promising directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Beyond Outcome-Based Imperfect-Recall: Higher-Resolution Abstractions for Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand abstraction is crucial for scaling imperfect-information games (IIGs) such as Texas Hold'em, yet progress is limited by the lack of a formal task model and by evaluations that require resource-intensive strategy solving. We introduce signal observation ordered games (SOOGs), a subclass of IIGs tailored to hold'em-style games that cleanly separates signal from player action sequences, providing a precise mathematical foundation for hand abstraction. Within this framework, we define a resolution bound-an information-theoretic upper bound on achievable performance under a given signal abstraction. Using the bound, we show that mainstream outcome-based imperfect-recall algorithms suffer substantial losses by arbitrarily discarding historical information; we formalize this behavior via potential-aware outcome Isomorphism (PAOI) and prove that PAOI characterizes their resolution bound. To overcome this limitation, we propose full-recall outcome isomorphism (FROI), which integrates historical information to raise the bound and improve policy quality. Experiments on hold'em-style benchmarks confirm that FROI consistently outperforms outcome-based imperfect-recall baselines. Our results provide a unified formal treatment of hand abstraction and practical guidance for designing higher-resolution abstractions in IIGs.</description>

      <title>How to Sell High-Dimensional Data Optimally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of selling large, proprietary data, we consider an information pricing problem proposed by Bergemann et al. that involves a decision-making buyer and a monopolistic seller. The seller has access to the underlying state of the world that determines the utility of the various actions the buyer may take. Since the buyer gains greater utility through better decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the seller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price. To contend with the fact that the seller may not be perfectly informed about the buyer's private preferences (or utility), we frame the problem of designing a data product as one where the seller designs a revenue-maximizing menu of statistical experiments.
  Prior work by Cai et al. showed that an optimal menu can be found in time polynomial in the state space, whereas we observe that the state space is naturally exponential in the dimension of the data. We propose an algorithm which, given only sampling access to the state space, provably generates a near-optimal menu with a number of samples independent of the state space. We then analyze a special case of high-dimensional Gaussian data, showing that (a) it suffices to consider scalar Gaussian experiments, (b) the optimal menu of such experiments can be found efficiently via a semidefinite program, and (c) full surplus extraction occurs if and only if a natural separation condition holds on the set of potential preferences of the buyer.</description>

      <title>HOB: A Holistically Optimized Bidding Strategy under Heterogeneous Auction Mechanisms with Organic Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic through either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was historically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) for bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a binding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher revenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory treatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side, advertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to QuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to bidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For automated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining optimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse advertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target return on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes two key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal bidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic traffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost alignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across heterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed framework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Renegotiable contract-theoretic incentive mechanism for Federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained prominence due to heightened concerns over data privacy. Privacy restrictions limit the visibility for data consumers (DCs) to accurately assess the capabilities and efforts of data owners (DOs). Thus, for open collaborative FL markets to thrive, effective incentive mechanisms are key as they can motivate data owners (DOs) to contribute to FL tasks. Contract theory is a useful technique for developing FL incentive mechanisms. Existing approaches generally assume that once the contract between a DC and a DO is signed, it remains unchanged until the FL task is finished. However, unforeseen circumstances might force a DO to be unable to fulfill the current contract, resulting in inefficient utilization of DCs' budgets. To address this limitation, we propose the Renegotiable Contract-Theoretic Incentive Mechanism (RC-TIM) for FL. Unlike previous approaches, it adapts to changes in DOs' behavior and budget constraints by supporting the renegotiation of contracts, providing flexible and dynamic incentives. Under RC-TIM, an FL system is more adaptive to unpredictable changes in the operating environment that can affect the quality of the service provided by DOs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RC-TIM significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art related methods, delivering up to a 45.76% increase in utility on average.</description>

      <title>Co-Investment with Dynamic Participation under Unforeseeable Opportunity Costs: A Coalitional Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technologies such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) depend on the availability of infrastructure. We define the Infrastructure Provider (InP) as the actor responsible for deploying and maintaining this infrastructure, while Service Providers (SPs) operate applications over it to serve end users and earn revenues. Deploying such infrastructure requires however a significant investment, and the InP may be reluctant to bear it alone. We propose co-investment to overcome this barrier, allowing players, the InP and multiple SPs, to share costs and revenues. However, committing to a co-investment over a long period may be too constraining for players: in an unforeseeable future, players may realize that they could make more profit outside the co-investment (such a profit is called opportunity cost). For this reason, we propose a scheme, based on coalitional game theory, which is dynamic in terms of (i)allowing players to join, remain in, or leave the co-investment, (ii) adjusting the infrastructure capacity and resource sharing over time. We propose a method to compute entry fees and exit penalties in order to appropriately compensate players remaining in the co-investment. We numerically show that our dynamic scheme encourages player participation and increases profit (in case of high opportunity cost).</description>

      <title>Reviving, reproducing, and revisiting Axelrod's second tournament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct reciprocity, typically studied using the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), is central to understanding how cooperation evolves. In the 1980s, Robert Axelrod organized two influential IPD computer tournaments, where Tit for Tat (TFT) emerged as the winner. Yet the archival record is incomplete: for the first tournament only a report survives, and for the second the submitted Fortran strategies remain but not the final tournament code. This gap raises questions about the reproducibility of these historically influential results. We recreate the second tournament by restoring the surviving Fortran implementations to compile with modern compilers and by building a Python interface that calls the original strategy functions without modification. Using the open-source Axelrod-Python library to run tournaments, we reproduce Axelrod's main findings: TFT prevails, and successful play tends to be cooperative, responsive to defection, and willing to forgive. Strategy rankings remain mostly unchanged. We then assess the robustness of the originally submitted strategies by incorporating additional strategies, and we run one of the largest IPD tournaments to date. We find that the original tournament was especially favorable to TFT and that it is difficult to dethrone TFT when the original submissions make up the majority of the field. We also observe that several lesser-known submissions perform strongly in more diverse settings and under noise. Our contributions are: (i) the first systematic reproduction of Axelrod's second tournament; (ii) a contemporary reassessment of the original results in light of new strategies and settings; and (iii) a preserved, easy-to-use implementation of the second-tournament strategies within Axelrod-Python to support future research.</description>

      <title>Active Inverse Methods in Stackelberg Games with Bounded Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse game theory is utilized to infer the cost functions of all players based on game outcomes. However, existing inverse game theory methods do not consider the learner as an active participant in the game, which could significantly enhance the learning process. In this paper, we extend inverse game theory to active inverse methods. For Stackelberg games with bounded rationality, the leader, acting as a learner, actively chooses actions to better understand the follower's cost functions. First, we develop a method of active learning by leveraging Fisher information to maximize information gain about the unknown parameters and prove the consistency and asymptotic normality. Additionally, when leaders consider its cost, we develop a method of active inverse game to balance exploration and exploitation, and prove the consistency and asymptotic Stackelberg equilibrium with quadratic cost functions. Finally, we verify the properties of these methods through simulations in the quadratic case and demonstrate that the active inverse game method can achieve Stackelberg equilibrium more quickly through active exploration.</description>

      <title>Strategic Interactions in Academic Dishonesty: A Game-Theoretic Analysis of the Exam Script Swapping Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel game theoretic framework for analyzing academic dishonesty through the lens of a unique deterrent mechanism: forced exam script swapping between students caught copying. We model the strategic interactions between students as a non cooperative game with asymmetric information and examine three base scenarios asymmetric preparation levels, mutual non preparation, and coordinated partial preparation. Our analysis reveals that the script swapping punishment creates a stronger deterrent effect than traditional penalties by introducing strategic interdependence in outcomes. The Nash equilibrium analysis demonstrates that mutual preparation emerges as the dominant strategy. The framework provides insights for institutional policy design, suggesting that unconventional punishment mechanisms that create mutual vulnerability can be more effective than traditional individual penalties. Future empirical validation and behavioral experiments are proposed to test the model predictions, including explorations of tapering off effects in punishment severity over time.</description>

      <title>Competition and Diversity in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent evidence, both in the lab and in the wild, suggests that the use of generative artificial intelligence reduces the diversity of content produced. The use of the same or similar AI models appears to lead to more homogeneous behavior. Our work begins with the observation that there is a force pushing in the opposite direction: compe- tition. When producers compete with one another (e.g., for customers or attention), they are incentivized to create novel or unique content. We explore the impact com- petition has on both content diversity and overall social welfare. Through a formal game-theoretic model, we show that competitive markets select for diverse AI models, mitigating monoculture. We further show that a generative AI model that performs well in isolation (i.e., according to a benchmark) may fail to provide value in a compet- itive market. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating generative AI models across the breadth of their output distributions, particularly when they will be deployed in competitive environments. We validate our results empirically by using language models to play Scattergories, a word game in which players are rewarded for answers that are both correct and unique. Overall, our results suggest that homogenization due to generative AI is unlikely to persist in competitive markets, and instead, competition in downstream markets may drive diversification in AI model development</description>

      <title>Cooperative Bargaining Games Without Utilities: Mediated Solutions from Direction Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative bargaining games are widely used to model resource allocation and conflict resolution. Traditional solutions assume the mediator can access agents utility function values and gradients. However, there is an increasing number of settings, such as human AI interactions, where utility values may be inaccessible or incomparable due to unknown, nonaffine transformations. To model such settings, we consider that the mediator has access only to agents most preferred directions, i.e., normalized utility gradients in the decision space. To this end, we propose a cooperative bargaining algorithm where a mediator has access to only the direction oracle of each agent. We prove that unlike popular approaches such as the Nash and Kalai Smorodinsky bargaining solutions, our approach is invariant to monotonic nonaffine transformations, and that under strong convexity and smoothness assumptions, this approach enjoys global asymptotic convergence to Pareto stationary solutions. Moreover, we show that the bargaining solutions found by our algorithm also satisfy the axioms of symmetry and (under slightly stronger conditions) independence of irrelevant alternatives, which are popular in the literature. Finally, we conduct experiments in two domains, multi agent formation assignment and mediated stock portfolio allocation, which validate these theoretic results. All code for our experiments can be found at https://github.com/suryakmurthy/dibs_bargaining.</description>

      <title>On Pareto-Optimal and Fair Allocations with Personalized Bi-Valued Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fair division problem of allocating $m$ indivisible goods to $n$ agents with additive personalized bi-valued utilities. Specifically, each agent $i$ assigns one of two positive values $a_i &gt; b_i &gt; 0$ to each good, indicating that agent $i$'s valuation of any good is either $a_i$ or $b_i$. For convenience, we denote the value ratio of agent $i$ as $r_i = a_i / b_i$.
  We give a characterization to all the Pareto-optimal allocations. Our characterization implies a polynomial-time algorithm to decide if a given allocation is Pareto-optimal in the case each $r_i$ is an integer. For the general case (where $r_i$ may be fractional), we show that this decision problem is coNP-complete. Our result complements the existing results: this decision problem is coNP-complete for tri-valued utilities (where each agent's value for each good belongs to $\{a,b,c\}$ for some prescribed $a&gt;b&gt;c\geq0$), and this decision problem belongs to P for bi-valued utilities (where $r_i$ in our model is the same for each agent).
  We further show that an EFX allocation always exists and can be computed in polynomial time under the personalized bi-valued utilities setting, which extends the previous result on bi-valued utilities. We propose the open problem of whether an EFX and Pareto-optimal allocation always exists (and can be computed in polynomial time).</description>

      <title>The Limits of Interval-Regulated Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study third-degree price discrimination in a model first presented by Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [2015]. Since such price discrimination might create market segments with vastly different posted prices, we consider regulating these prices, specifically, by restricting them to lie within an interval. Given a price interval, we consider segmentations of the market where a seller, who is oblivious to the existence of such regulation, still posts prices within the price interval. We show the following surprising result: For any market and price interval where such segmentation is feasible, there is always a different segmentation that optimally transfers all excess surplus to the consumers. In addition, we characterize the entire space of buyer and seller surplus that is achievable by such segmentation, including maximizing seller surplus, and simultaneously minimizing buyer and seller surplus. A key technical challenge is that the classical segmentation method of Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris [2015] fails under price constraints. To address this, we develop three intuitive but fundamentally distinct segmentation constructions, each tailored to a different surplus objective. These constructions maintain different invariants, reflect different economic intuitions, and collectively form the core of our regulated surplus characterization.</description>

      <title>Online Matroid Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of an online matroid embedding, which is an algorithm for mapping an unknown matroid that is revealed in an online fashion to a larger-but-known matroid. We establish the existence of such an embedding for binary matroids, and use it to relate variants of the binary matroid secretary problem to each other, showing that seemingly simpler problems are in fact equivalent to seemingly harder ones (up to constant-factors). Specifically, we show this to be the case for the version of the matroid secretary problem in which the matroid is not known in advance, and where it is known in advance. We also show that the version with known matroid structure, is equivalent to the problem where weights are not fully adversarial but drawn from a known pairwise-independent distribution.</description>

Abstract: In multi-item screening, optimal selling mechanisms are challenging to characterize and implement, even with full knowledge of valuation distributions. In this paper, we aim to develop tractable, interpretable, and implementable mechanisms with strong performance guarantees in the absence of precise distributional knowledge. In particular, we study robust screening with a maximin ratio objective. We show that given the marginal support of valuations, the optimal mechanism is separable: each item's allocation probability and payment depend only on its own valuation and not on other items' valuations. However, we design the allocation and payment rules by leveraging the available joint support information. This enhanced separable mechanism can be efficiently implemented through randomized pricing for individual products, which is easy to interpret and implement. Moreover, our framework extends naturally to scenarios where the seller possesses marginal support information on aggregate valuations for any product bundle partition, for which we characterize a bundle-wise separable mechanism and its guarantee. Beyond rectangular-support ambiguity sets, we further establish the optimality of randomized grand bundling mechanisms within a broad class of ambiguity sets, which we term ``$\boldsymbol{\rho}-$scaled invariant ambiguity set".</description>

      <title>Neural Mean-Field Games: Extending Mean-Field Game Theory with Neural Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13228</link>

Abstract: Mean-field game theory relies on approximating games that are intractible to model due to a very large to infinite population of players. While these kinds of games can be solved analytically via the associated system of partial derivatives, this approach is not model-free, can lead to the loss of the existence or uniqueness of solutions, and may suffer from modelling bias. To reduce the dependency between the model and the game, we introduce neural mean-field games: a combination of mean-field game theory and deep learning in the form of neural stochastic differential equations. The resulting model is data-driven, lightweight, and can learn extensive strategic interactions that are hard to capture using mean-field theory alone. In addition, the model is based on automatic differentiation, making it more robust and objective than approaches based on finite differences. We highlight the efficiency and flexibility of our approach by solving two mean-field games that vary in their complexity, observability, and the presence of noise. Lastly, we illustrate the model's robustness by simulating viral dynamics based on real-world data. Here, we demonstrate that the model's ability to learn from real-world data helps to accurately model the evolution of an epidemic outbreak. Using these results, we show that the model is flexible, generalizable, and requires few observations to learn the distribution underlying the data.</description>
