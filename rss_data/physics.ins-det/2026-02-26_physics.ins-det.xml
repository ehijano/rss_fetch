      <title>Development of Micromegas-based Active-Target Time Projection Chamber for Nuclear Astrophysics Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Micromegas-based active-target detector named SAT-TPC (Saha Active Target TPC) has been designed and fabricated at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics. The SAT-TPC was tested with Ar-CO2 (90:10) and Ar-iC4H10 (95:5) at atmospheric pressure. The Micromegas detector was first characterized in a small test chamber to optimize the ratio between the drift and amplification fields to maximise electron transparency. After establishing the optimal operating parameters, the same Micromegas detector was employed as the readout plane of the SAT-TPC prototype. The energy resolution for 55Fe and 241Am was estimated. A straightforward analysis of {\alpha}-particle tracks has been carried out, demonstrating the pad plane's capability to accurately reconstruct the direction and length of trajectories. A hydrodynamic model based on Geant4, Garfield++ and COMSOL was used to emulate the reconstructed {\alpha}-tracks in the active gas volume. The results show good agreement with simulations, confirming the accuracy of the models employed for {\alpha}-particles in Ar-CO2 (90:10) and Ar-iC4H10(95:5) gas.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Data Needs for Microcalorimetry and Non-destructive Assay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic microcalorimeters are state-of-the-art radiation detectors using superconducting and quantum technologies. They can resolve complex X-ray and low-energy {\gamma}-ray spectra with ultra-high energy resolution of an order of 10 eV at 100 keV, enabling high-precision non-destructive assay (NDA) analysis of nuclear materials containing uranium, plutonium and other actinides. With significant technical advancements in microcalorimetry technology, microcalorimeters are now deployable to end-users such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for improved NDA. However, the accuracy of microcalorimetry analysis can be limited by nuclear data. There are several cases that the current nuclear data obtained by conventional radiation detector technologies is not sufficient to support microcalorimetry analysis. To address the growing need for improved nuclear data in microcalorimetry, the U.S. Department of Energy Office of International Nuclear Safeguards hosted a workshop on Microcalorimetry and Nuclear Data (MiND) in June 2023. Microcalorimetry experts and users, and nuclear structure evaluators and managers, and program sponsors attended the workshop with the main objective of identifying a roadmap for priority nuclear data, stakeholders, partnerships, and opportunities. This paper summarizes the outcome of the MiND workshop, including the priority list of nuclear data for microcalorimetry and a multi-laboratory measurement campaign to improve such nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Surrogate neutron-capture studies with fission detection in inverse kinematics at the ESR storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NECTAR (Nuclear rEaCTions At storage Rings) experiment at the ESR heavy-ion storage ring at GSI Darmstadt is dedicated to surrogate reaction studies of neutron-induced reactions on heavy nuclei in inverse kinematics. In this work, we report on the implementation and performance of a newly developed fission-fragment detection system integrated into the NECTAR experimental setup. The upgraded detector configuration enables, for the first time in a surrogate experiment, the simultaneous detection of \(\gamma\)-decay residues, multi-neutron-emission residues, and fission fragments. The full setup was used for the first time in an experiment where a stored beam of bare \(^{238}\)U\(^{92+}\) ions at 17.24~MeV/u interacted with a gaseous deuterium target, populating excited \(^{238}\)U and \(^{239}\)U nuclei via the \(^{238}\)U(d,d') and \(^{238}\)U(d,p) reactions. We describe the fission detector geometry, design constraints, and simulation-based efficiency determination. The target-like particle identification and beam-like residue spectra demonstrating the performance of the complete setup are also shown.</description>

      <title>A novel perspective on crystal electromagnetic calorimeter design for the CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal electromagnetic calorimeters (ECALs) are essential for high-precision measurements of electrons and photons in particle physics experiments. However, the conventional design, in which long crystal bars point radially toward the interaction region and lack longitudinal segmentation, is incompatible with the three-dimensional shower imaging required by Particle Flow Approach (PFA). We propose a novel perspective on crystal ECAL design to address this limitation. The key innovation is a geometric reconfiguration in which crystal bars are oriented to face the interaction region and arranged orthogonally in adjacent longitudinal layers. This layout achieves fine spatial segmentation of energy deposits by correlating measurements of orthogonal crystal bars. An interleaved structure of regular and inverted trapezoidal modules is incorporated to maximize structural uniformity and detector hermeticity. This design is engineered to preserve the excellent intrinsic energy resolution of crystal ECALs while simultaneously providing the detailed three-dimensional shower imaging essential for PFA. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of achieving excellent energy resolution of $1.14\%/\sqrt{E} \oplus 0.44\%$. Consequently, the proposed design repositions crystal ECAL as a foundational component for PFA-oriented detector systems at facilities such as the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), offering a new technical pathway to advance the physics goals of future colliders.</description>

      <title>Towards Low-Energy Electron High-Resolution Spectroscopy with Transition-Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the energy resolution of transition-edge sensors (TESs) for the detection of electrons in the 100 eV kinetic energy range. The TES is a Ti-Au bilayer with an active area of $(60 \times 60)$ $\mu \text{m}^2$ and a critical temperature of $\sim$ 80 mK. The electron source is based on vertically-aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes located inside the cryostat, with electrons generated via field emission. For electrons in the (92 - 99) eV kinetic energy range, we obtain a Gaussian energy resolution for fully-absorbed electrons of (0.479 $\pm$ 0.041 $\pm$ 0.055) eV. When considering the full-width at half-maximum of the peak, the corresponding resolution is of (1.44 $\pm$ 0.17 $\pm$ 0.27) eV. The former represents an improvement of (46 - 60)% with respect to previous results, and is mainly attributed to the reduction in the TES active area. The latter is instead an improvement of over a factor of 20, and is mainly due to the reduction in the emitting area of the electron source, which significantly suppresses electron back-scattering in proximity of the TES. These results represent a major milestone toward high-precision spectroscopy on low-energy electrons, which is a key objective for the PTOLEMY experiment.</description>

      <title>Beam tube boundary effects in stray light modeling of long Fabry-Perot arm cavities for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope will operate 10-40 km Fabry-Perot arm cavities inside vacuum beam tubes. FFT-based paraxial tools treat propagation in free space and therefore do not explicitly enforce beam tube boundary conditions. We introduce a waveguide-like mode description of the optical field that incorporates an imposed beam tube boundary condition and enables an independent benchmark of free-space FFT tools We derive the associated modal-mixing matrices for mirrors and baffles, including a closed-form series for axisymmetric circular apertures. We quantify the strain-equivalent couplings from baffle miscentering and from a localized near-wall tube defect, and show that they are suppressed as baffle density increases. In the relevant regime of densely baffled cavities and small perturbations, beam tube boundary effects are subdominant, which supports the continued use of FFT-based codes to guide the design of 3G detectors.</description>

      <title>Precision measurements of 2-3 oscillation parameters in the next-generation long-baseline experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, data from leading neutrino experiments have firmly established neutrino oscillation, implying non-zero neutrino masses and leptonic mixing and thereby providing confirmed evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. On the backdrop of the precision era of neutrino oscillation, this thesis underscores its relevance by demonstrating the physics reach of the forthcoming long-baseline experiments -- Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) -- to establish non-maximal $\theta_{23}$, resolve the correct $\theta_{23}$ octant, and improve the precision on $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$ by efficiently breaking parameter degeneracies. This is enabled by DUNE's high-resolution LArTPC detector and its wide-band beam, achieving sensitivity at a high confidence level compared to the global fits of world neutrino data. The combined analysis of DUNE and Hyper-K not only significantly enhances sensitivity to these phenomenological studies but also demonstrates their capabilities at lower exposures when operated together, relative to their nominal individual exposures. In addition, we investigate the impact of flavor-dependent long-range interactions arising from anomaly-free U(1)' extensions of the Standard Model, showing that although subdominant long-range interactions can substantially influence the sensitivity and precision of oscillation parameter measurements, the complementary strengths of DUNE and Hyper-K mitigate these challenges to a large extent.</description>

      <title>A time-to-digital converter with steady calibration through single-photon detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs) are a crucial tool in a wide array of fields, in particular for quantum communication, where time taggers performance can severely affect the quality of the entire application. Nowadays, FPGA-based TDCs present a viable alternative to ASIC ones, once the non-linear behavior due to the intrinsic nature of the device is properly mitigated. To compensate for said nonlinearities, a calibration procedure is required, which should be maintained throughout its runtime. Here we present the design and the demonstration of a TDC that is FPGA-based showing a residual FWHM jitter of 27 ps, that is scalable for multichannel operation. The target application in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is discussed with a calibration method based on the exploitation of single-photon detection that does not require stopping the data acquisition or using any estimation methods, thus increasing accuracy and removing data loss. The calibration was tested in a relevant environment, investigating the behavior of the device between 5 {\deg}C and 80 {\deg}C. Moreover, our design is capable of continuously streaming up to 12 Mevents/s for up to ~1 week without the TDC overflowing making it ready for a real-life scenario deployment.</description>
