      <title>Proper actions on finite products of hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ is said to have property (PH') if there exist finitely many hyperbolic spaces $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ on which $G$ acts coboundedly such that the diagonal action of $G$ on the product $\prod_{i=1}^nX_i$ equipped with $\ell^1$-metric is proper. A group $G$ has property (PH) if it virtually has property (PH'). This notion is a generalization of property (QT) introduced by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara \cite{BBF21}. In this paper, we initiate the study of property (PH) of groups and give a complete characterization of groups with property (PH') or (PH) from lineal actions.
  In addition, by considering a central extension of groups $1\to Z\to E\to G\to 1$, we prove that $E$ has property (PH) (resp. (QT)) if and only if $G$ has property (PH) (resp. (QT)) and the Euler class of the extension is bounded. We also derive similar results for amalgamated direct products and graph products. As corollaries, we characterize when 3-manifold groups have property (PH) and obtain more interesting examples with property (QT) including the central extension of residually finite hyperbolic groups, the mapping class group of any finite-type surface and the outer automorphism group of torsion-free one-ended hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>On some semidirect products of skew braces arising in Hopf-Galois theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify skew braces that are the semidirect product of an ideal and a left ideal. As a consequence, given a Galois extension of fields $ L/K $ whose Galois group is the semidirect product of a normal subgroup $ A $ and a subgroup $ B $, we classify the Hopf-Galois structures on $ L/K $ that realize $ L^{A} $ via a normal Hopf subalgebra and $ L^{B} $ via a Hopf subalgebra. We show that the Hopf algebra giving such a Hopf-Galois structure is the smash product of these Hopf subalgebras, and use this description to study generalized normal basis generators and questions of integral module structure in extensions of local fields.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff Dimension of non-conical and Myrberg limit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop techniques to study the Hausdorff dimensions of non-conical and Myrberg limit sets for groups acting on negatively curved spaces. We establish maximality of the Hausdorff dimension of the non-conical limit set of $G$ in the following cases. 1. $M$ is a finite volume complete Riemannian manifold of pinched negative curvature and $G$ is an infinite normal subgroups of infinite index in $\pi_1(M)$. 2. $G$ acts on a regular tree $X$ with $X/G$ infinite and amenable (dimension 1). 3. $G$ acts on the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb H^2$ such that $\mathbb H^2/G$ has Cheeger constant zero (dimension 2). 4. $G$ is a finitely generated geometrically infinite Kleinian group (dimension 3). We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of the Myrberg limit set is the same as the critical exponent, confirming a conjecture of Falk-Matsuzaki.</description>

      <title>Computing $H$-equations with 2-by-2 integral matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transference through finite index extensions of the notion of equational coherence, as well as its effective counterpart. We deduce an explicit algorithm for solving the following algorithmic problem about size two integral invertible matrices: ''given $h_1,\ldots, h_r; g\in \operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, decide whether $g$ is algebraic over the subgroup $H=\langle h_1,\ldots ,h_r\rangle \leqslant \operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ (i.e., whether there exist a non-trivial $H$-equation $w(x)\in H*\langle x\rangle$ such that $w(g)=1$) and, in the affirmative case, compute finitely many such $H$-equations $w_1(x),\ldots ,w_s(x)\in H*\langle x\rangle$ further satisfying that any $w(x)\in H*\langle x\rangle$ with $w(g)=1$ is a product of conjugates of $w_1(x),\ldots ,w_s(x)$''. The same problem for square matrices of size 4 and bigger is unsolvable.</description>

      <title>Graph quandles: Generalized Cayley graphs of racks and right quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve two open problems of Valeriy Bardakov about Cayley graphs of racks and graph-theoretic realizations of right quasigroups. We also extend Didier Caucal's classification of labeled Cayley digraphs to right quasigroups and related algebraic structures like quandles.
  First, we characterize markings of graphs that realize racks. As an application, we construct rack-theoretic (di)graph invariants from permutation representations of graph automorphism groups. We describe how to compute these invariants with general results for path graphs and cycle graphs.
  Second, we show that all right quasigroups are realizable by edgeless graphs and complete (di)graphs. Using Schreier (di)graphs, we also characterize Cayley (di)graphs of right quasigroups Q that realize Q. In particular, all racks are realizable by their full Cayley (di)graphs.
  Finally, we give a graph-theoretic characterization of labeled Cayley digraphs of right-cancellative magmas, right-divisible magmas, right quasigroups, racks, quandles, involutory racks, and kei.</description>

      <title>On the local representation theory of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ of a symmetric group, we describe the action of its normalizer on $\mathrm{Irr}(P)$. To this end, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the irreducible characters of $P$ and certain equivalence classes of explicitly defined functions, which are also naturally suited to describing the Galois action.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequalities in Hadamard spaces of asymptotic rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gromov's isoperimetric gap conjecture for Hadamard spaces states that cycles in dimensions greater than or equal to the asymptotic rank admit linear isoperimetric filling inequalities, as opposed to the inequalities of Euclidean type in lower dimensions. In the case of asymptotic rank 2, recent progress was made by Dru\c{t}u-Lang-Papasoglu-Stadler who established a homotopical inequality for Lipschitz 2-spheres with exponents arbitrarily close to 1. We prove a homological inequality of the same type for general cycles in dimensions at least 2, assuming that the ambient space has finite linearly controlled asymptotic dimension. This holds in particular for all Hadamard 3-manifolds and finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complexes.</description>

      <title>A remark on the number of automorphisms of some algebraic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes we look at the following question. Given a category $\mathcal C$ of algebraic structure (e.g. the category of groups, monoids, partial groups, ...) and a rational $r\in \mathbb Q$, does there exists an element $x\in \mathcal C$ such that the size of its automorphism group $\text{Aut}_{\mathcal C} (x)$ divided by the size of $x$ (whatever that would means) is equal to $r$\,? To our knowledge, this question was introduced by T\u{a}rn\u{a}uceanu in the category of groups. Here, we answer positively to this question in the categories of graphs, monoids, partial groups and posets.</description>

      <title>Posets arising from decompositions of objects in a monoidal category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a symmetric monoidal category $C$ with product $\sqcup$, where the neutral element for the product is an initial object, we consider the poset of $\sqcup$-complemented subobjects of a given object $X$. When this poset has finite height, we define decompositions and partial decompositions of $X$ which are coherent with $\sqcup$, and order them by refinement. From these posets, we define complexes of frames and partial bases, augmented Bergman complexes and related ordered versions. We propose a unified approach to the study of their combinatorics and homotopy type, establishing various properties and relations between them. Via explicit homotopy formulas, we will be able to transfer structural properties, such as Cohen-Macaulayness.
  In well-studied scenarios, the poset of $\sqcup$-complemented subobjects specializes to the poset of free factors of a free group, the subspace poset of a vector space, the poset of non-degenerate subspaces of a vector space with a non-degenerate form, and the lattice of flats of a matroid. The decomposition and partial decomposition posets, the complex of frames and partial bases together with the ordered versions, either coincide with well-known structures, generalize them, or yield new interesting objects. In these particular cases, we provide new results along with open questions and conjectures.</description>

      <title>7-location, weak systolicity and isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $m$-location is a local combinatorial condition for flag simplicial complexes introduced by Osajda. Osajda showed that simply connected 8-located locally 5-large complexes are hyperbolic. We treat the nonpositive curvature case of 7-located locally 5-large complexes.
  We show that any minimal area disc diagram in a 7-located locally 5-large complex is itself 7-located and locally 5-large. We define a natural CAT(0) metric for 7-located disc diagrams and use this to prove that simply connected 7-located locally 5-large complexes have quadratic isoperimetric function. Along the way, we prove that locally weakly systolic complexes are 7-located locally 5-large.</description>
