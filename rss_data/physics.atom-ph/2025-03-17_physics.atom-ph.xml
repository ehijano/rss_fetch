      <title>Resonant optical bistability in support of enhanced Rydberg atom sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency antennas based on highly excited Rydberg atom vapors can in principle reach sensitivities beyond those of any conventional wire antenna, especially at lower frequencies where very long wires are needed to accommodate the growing wavelength. Conventional Rydberg sensors are based on individual atom response, with increased signal resolution relying on the $O(10^3)$ electric dipole moment enhancement, scaling as the square of the Rydberg state principal quantum number $N \sim 50$. However, despite more than thirty years of steady advances, beyond-classical signal sensitivity has yet to be demonstrated. More recently, the optical bistability effect, a many body nonequilibrium phase transition occurring at somewhat higher vapor densities, has been exploited for an order of magnitude or more increased sensitivity for some setups through tuning into the critical region. However, the results fall significantly short of those using more advanced ``conventional'' Rydberg sensor setups -- which achieve even greater enhancement by exploiting resonant interaction between a pair of nearby Rydberg levels. This paper seeks to \emph{combine} the many body and resonant enhancement effects by extending the bistable phase analysis to include a pair of resonant Rydberg levels, supported by an exact treatment of the atom velocity thermal average. A dynamic linear response formalism is developed as well to explore the tradeoff between measurement sensitivity and finite bandwidth signals. We demonstrate regions of the phase diagram which could be exploited for record breaking, beyond-classical sensitivity. Of course, only a limited number of vapor parameters are under full experimental control, and experiments will be needed to quantitatively constrain the effective mean field interaction parameters appearing in the theory, and thereby define the accessible regions of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Josephson vortices and persistent current in a double-ring supersolid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for the Ericson Transition in Stochastic Quantum Scattering and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At lower energies, the resonances in scattering experiments are often isolated. The crucial parameter is the ratio of average resonance width and average mean level spacing. Towards larger energies, this parameter grows, because the resonances overlap. Eventually the cross-section becomes a random function and the scattering matrix elements follow a universal Gaussian distribution. For more than sixty years, this Ericson transition awaits a concise analytical treatment. We provide a complete solution within the Heidelberg approach which provides a full-fledged model of the scattering process. As a side result, we obtain explicit formulae for the moments of the distributions. We compare with microwave experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigating the hyperfine systematic error and relative phase in low spin-polarization alkali FID magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alkali-metal optically-pumped magnetometers are prone to inaccuracies arising from the overlap of the average F = I + 1/2 and F = I - 1/2 ground-state Zeeman resonances. We employ density-matrix simulations and experiments to investigate how this hyperfine systematic error varies with spin polarization in a $^{87}$Rb free-induction-decay (FID) magnetometer. At low spin polarizations, ($P \leq 0.5$), this effect causes single-frequency magnetic-field extraction techniques to exhibit inaccuracies up to approximately 3.5 nT. Density-matrix simulations reveal that this bias can be traced to the relative amplitude and phase between the F = I $\pm$ 1/2 hyperfine ground-state manifolds in the FID spin precession signal. We show that this systematic error can be mitigated using either a double-frequency fitting model that accounts for the relative amplitude and phase or synchronous-pulse pumping, that minimizes the F = 1 contribution to the FID signal. Theoretical simulations predict accuracies within 0.5 nT for both techniques across a wide range of spin polarizations, suggesting a sevenfold enhancement over single-frequency extraction methods. Our experiments validate this, showcasing a variation in the extracted field below 1 nT, a 3.5-fold improvement compared to single-frequency extraction methods. Furthermore, the mitigation techniques demonstrate agreement of the extracted magnetic field within 1.5 nT.</description>

      <title>Individual assembly of two-species Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach to investigating Rydberg molecules by demonstrating the formation and characterization of individual Rb$^{*}$Cs Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers. By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we observe molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the formation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic distances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the tweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring the effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate molecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way for state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding energies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with theory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms, expanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration of Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.</description>

      <title>Anomalous nuclear effects on ion charge state distribution in helium gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of isotope differences on ion charge state yield ratios has never been studied in detail, having been considered negligible. However, we have observed anomalous ion charge state distributions in the thermalization of energetic atomic ions in helium gas; the charge state distributions varied between not only isotopes but also between nuclear states within the same nuclide. The magnitude of the observed results suggests that this anomaly is a universal phenomenon that cannot be explained by the framework of the known isotope effects. Nuclear spin and deformation could be key to unraveling this, but the mechanisms remain an open question.</description>

      <title>Ground-state selection via many-body superradiant decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a single particle, relaxation into different ground states is governed by fixed branching ratios determined by the transition matrix element and the environment. Here, we show that in many-body open quantum systems the occupation probability of one ground state can be boosted well beyond what is dictated by single-particle branching ratios. Despite the competition, interactions suppress all but the dominant decay transition, leading to a 'winner takes all' dynamic where the system primarily settles into the dominant ground state. We prove that, in the presence of permutation symmetry, this problem is exactly solvable for any number of competing channels. Additionally, we develop an approximate model for the dynamics by mapping the evolution onto a fluid continuity equation, and analytically demonstrate that the dominant transition ratio converges to unity as a power law with increasing system size, for any branching ratios. This near-deterministic preparation of the dominant ground state has broad applicability. As an example, we discuss a protocol for molecular photoassociation where collective dynamics effectively acts as a catalyst, amplifying the yield in a specific final state. Our results open new avenues for many-body strategies in the preparation and control of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Splitting and connecting singlets in atomic quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering hypervolume of two-component fermions in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the zero-energy collision of three fermions, two of which are in the spin-down ($\downarrow$) state and one of which is in the spin-up ($\uparrow$) state. Assuming that the two-body and the three-body interactions have a finite range, we find a parameter, $D$, called the three-body scattering hypervolume. We study the three-body wave function asymptotically when three fermions are far apart or one spin-$\uparrow$ (spin-$\downarrow$) fermion and one pair, formed by the other two fermions, are far apart, and derive three asymptotic expansions of the wave function. The three-body scattering hypervolume $D$ appears in the coefficients of such expansions at the order of $B^{-5}$, where $B=\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$ is the hyperradius of the triangle formed by the three fermions (we assume that the three fermions have the same mass), and $s_1,s_2,s_3$ are the sides of the triangle. We compute the $T$-matrix element for three such fermions colliding at low energy in terms of $D$ in the absence of two-body interactions. When the interactions are weak, we calculate $D$ approximately using the Born expansion. We also analyze the energy shift of three two-component fermions in a large periodic cube due to $D$ and generalize this result to the many-fermion system. $D$ also determines the three-body recombination rates in two-component Fermi gases, and we calculate the three-body recombination rates in terms of $D$ and the density and temperature of the gas.</description>
