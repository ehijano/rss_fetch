      <title>Constraints on the dark matter-baryon interaction cross section from galaxy cluster thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) models with a non-zero DM-baryon interaction cross section imply energy transfer between DM and baryons. We present a new method of constraining the DM-baryon interaction cross section and DM particle mass for velocity-independent interactions using the thermodynamics of galaxy clusters. If the baryonic gas in these clusters is in thermodynamic equilibrium and DM cools baryons, this cooling rate is limited by the net heating rate of other mechanisms in the cluster. We use the REFLEX clusters from the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of Galaxies (MCXC) with mass estimates from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) catalog of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters. This yields 95% upper bounds on the DM-proton interaction cross section for velocity-independent interactions of $\sigma_0\leq9.3\times10^{-28} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ for DM masses, $m_\chi = 10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ GeV. These constraints are within an order of magnitude of the best constraints derived in this mass range, and serve as a complementary, independent constraint. We also apply this model to the fractional interacting DM scenario, where only 10% and 1% of the DM is interacting. Unlike other methods, this constraint scales linearly with this fraction. This yields 95% upper bounds of $\sigma_0\leq1.1\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ and $\sigma_0\leq8.2\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$, which are the strongest existing constraints for this scenario. This paper serves as a proof of concept. Upcoming SZ measurements will provide temperature profiles for galaxy clusters. Combining these measurements with more complex thermodynamic models could lead to more robust constraints.</description>

      <title>On the universality of the halo mass function beyond ${\Lambda}$CDM cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of dark matter haloes as a function of halo mass is a key diagnostic for constraining the cosmological model. The theoretical framework based on excursion set arguments, when applied to an initial Gaussian random field of density fluctuations, predicts universal behaviour for this quantity, when variables are recast in terms of peak height. The great advantage of this, if true, is that it implies one simply needs to accurately simulate only a single cosmological model to build an emulator for any other cosmology of interest. This tantalising possibility has inspired a number of studies over the years. In practice, the diversity of ways for defining haloes has led to a variety of mixed results concerning this issue. In this work, we utilise a suite of high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations, to revisit this question for friends-of-friends haloes. We perform our study in the context of the flat, time-evolving dark energy model (hereafter $w$CDM), and with simple modifications of the primordial physics afforded through variations of the scalar power spectral index and its possible running. We construct the universal mass function locus from our fiducial simulation (a ${\Lambda}$CDM model) and emulate this using a linear interpolating function. We then compare this against the loci that we measure for our array of alternate models. We find mass functions that are consistent with universality to within ${\lesssim} \ 5\%$ in the fractional difference, with respect to variations of the 8 cosmological parameters that we have considered (2 variations per parameter) and for redshifts $z &lt; 7$.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations on small scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Toward a practical haloscope for the post-inflation axion incorporating a photonic band gap structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and future searches for dark matter axions, based on their resonant conversion to photons in a magnetic field, span many orders of magnitude, from the very low mass GUT-scale axion to the very high mass post-inflation axion. The higher end of this range, 10 GHz and above is challenging for conventional microwave cavity-based experiments, owing to the steep drop-off in volume and thus conversion power with frequency. We present results on a first step towards a tunable microwave resonator that can be made suitably large and sufficiently high in frequency to begin probing the lower end of the post-inflation axion mass range. The design incorporates a tunable symmetric lattice and a photonic band gap structure that confines the TM$_{010}$ mode to which the axion couples, while suppressing all TE modes to which the axion does not.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric reconstructions of cosmic curvature: current constraints and forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assumption of a flat universe that follows the cosmological principle, i.e., that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic at large scales, comprises one of the core foundations of the standard cosmological model -- namely, the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Nevertheless, it has been seldom tested in the literature. In this work, we assess the validity of this hypothesis by reconstructing the cosmic curvature with currently available observations, such as Type Ia Supernova and Cosmic Chronometers. We do so by means of null tests, given by consistency relations within the standard model scenario, using a non-parametric method -- which allows us to circumvent prior assumptions on the underlying cosmology. We find no statistically significant departure from the cosmological principle and null curvature in our analysis. In addition, we show that future cosmological observations, such as those expected from Hubble parameter measurements from redshift surveys, along with gravitational wave observations as standard sirens, will be able to significantly reduce the uncertainties of current reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory-burdened black holes on primordial gravitational waves in light of Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue-tilted Gravitational Waves (BGWs) have been proposed as a potential candidate for the cosmic gravitational waves detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). In the standard cosmological framework, BGWs are constrained in their frequency range by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) limit on GW amplitude, which precludes their detection at interferometer scales. However, introducing a phase of early matter domination dilutes BGWs at higher frequencies, ensuring compatibility with both the BBN and LIGO constraints on stochastic GWs. This mechanism allows BGWs to align with PTA data while producing a distinct and testable GW signal across a broad frequency spectrum. Ultralight Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could provide the required early matter-dominated phase to support this process. Interpreted through the lens of BGWs, the PTA results offer a way to constrain the parameter space of a new scenario involving modified Hawking radiation, known as the ``memory burden" effect, associated with ultralight PBHs. This interpretation can be further probed by high-frequency GW detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate that PBHs as light as $10^{2-3}~{\rm g}$ can leave detectable imprints on BGWs at higher frequencies while remaining consistent with PTA observations.</description>

      <title>A preference for dynamical phantom dark energy using one-parameter model with Planck, DESI DR1 BAO and SN data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) provides a powerful tool to measure cosmic expansion and consequently the nature of the Dark Energy (DE). Recent precise BAO measurements by Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data release 1 (DESI DR1), when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and Supernovae of Type Ia (SN Ia), favor evolving dark energy over cosmological constant. This result is strongly related to the assumed priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization of DE. We test another parametrization which introduces two free parameters $n$ and $\alpha$, only $n$ is independent. Thus, it reduces the parameter space compared to the CPL model, which derives a more robust preference for evolving DE, if any. The model potentially produces three cosmological scenarios according to the values of its parameters. For $n=3$, the $\Lambda$CDM model is recovered, quintessence for $n&lt;3$, and phantom for $n&gt;3$. In the present study, we test the model on the background level, and, to our knowledge for the first time, on the linear perturbation level. Bayesian evidence analysis shows a weak preference for dynamical DE in the phantom regime over the cosmological constant DE using Planck, DESI, and PantheonPlus\&amp;SH0ES data. The model predicts current phantom DE $w_{de,0} = -1.073 \pm 0.032$ and $H_0=70.9\pm 1.4$ km/s/Mpc when Planck+DESI data is used, which decreases the tension with $H_0$ local measurements to $1.2\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of the QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in QCD, is a prominent candidate for dark matter (DM). In the presence of strong magnetic fields, such as those around neutron stars, axions can theoretically convert into photons, producing detectable electromagnetic signals. This axion-photon coupling provides a unique experimental pathway to probe axions within a specific mass range. We investigate a novel observational approach using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients that could arise from interactions between neutron stars and dense DM clumps known as axion miniclusters. By observing the core of Andromeda with the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz), we achieve sensitivity to axions with masses in the range of (33 - 42)$\,\mu$eV, with a mass resolution of $3.8 \times 10^{-4}\,\mu$eV. We detail our observational and analytical strategies developed to capture transient signals from axion-photon conversion, achieving an instrumental sensitivity of $2\,$mJy per spectral channel. Despite our sensitivity threshold, no candidate signals exceeding the 5$\sigma$ level were identified. Future implementations will extend this search across additional spectral bands and refine the modeling used for the processes involved, strengthening the constraints on axion DM models.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Peculiar Velocity Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peculiar velocities are the motions of galaxies due to the gravitational influence of large-scale structure, and thus are an important cosmological probe of the underlying matter density field. In recent years the number of surveys designed to measure peculiar velocities has increased, to the point that it is plausible that we will have completely mapped out the peculiar velocity field in the local universe within the next decade. Such an abundance of data will enable us to place precise constraints on the growth rate of large-scale structure which in turn will inform us about the true nature of the laws of gravity and the standard cosmological model. In this chapter, the physics governing the generation of peculiar velocities, the methods of measuring them, and the statistical tools used to extract cosmological information from them are described. It will also cover a swathe of current and future surveys dedicated to collecting peculiar velocities, what their aims are, and what these datasets may mean for the future of cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Statistics of the supermassive black hole gravitational wave background anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the anisotropy in the gravitational wave (GW) background originating from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We derive the distribution of the GW anisotropy power spectrum coefficients, $C_{l\geq1}/C_0$, in scenarios including environmental effects and eccentricities of the SMBH binaries. Although the mean of $C_{l\geq1}/C_0$ is the same for all multipoles, we show that their distributions vary, with the low $l$ distributions being the widest. We also find a strong correlation between spectral fluctuations and the anisotropy in the GW signal. We show that the GW anisotropy can break the degeneracy between the scenarios including environmental effects or eccentricity. In particular, we find that existing NANOGrav constraints on GW anisotropy begin to constrain SMBH scenarios with strong environmental effects.</description>

      <title>Extensive analysis of reconstruction algorithms for DESI 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal has been a standard procedure in BAO analyses over the past decade and has helped to improve the BAO parameter precision by a factor of ~2 on average. The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO analysis for the first year (DR1) data uses the ``standard'' reconstruction framework, in which the displacement field is estimated from the observed density field by solving the linearized continuity equation in redshift space, and galaxy and random positions are shifted in order to partially remove nonlinearities. There are several approaches to solving for the displacement field in real survey data, including the multigrid (MG), iterative Fast Fourier Transform (iFFT), and iterative Fast Fourier Transform particle (iFFTP) algorithms. In this work, we analyze these algorithms and compare them with various metrics including two-point statistics and the displacement itself using realistic DESI mocks. We focus on three representative DESI samples, the emission line galaxies (ELG), quasars (QSO), and the bright galaxy sample (BGS), which cover the extreme redshifts and number densities, and potential wide-angle effects. We conclude that the MG and iFFT algorithms agree within 0.4% in post-reconstruction power spectrum on BAO scales with the RecSym convention, which does not remove large-scale redshift space distortions (RSDs), in all three tracers. The RecSym convention appears to be less sensitive to displacement errors than the RecIso convention, which attempts to remove large-scale RSDs. However, iFFTP deviates from the first two; thus, we recommend against using iFFTP without further development. In addition, we provide the optimal settings for reconstruction for five years of DESI observation. The analyses presented in this work pave the way for DESI DR1 analysis as well as future BAO analyses.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Gauge Friction in Natural Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extension of the natural inflation model comprising a non-Abelian gauge sector coupled to the axion-inflaton kinetic term. We show how such non-minimal coupling serves as a source of friction for the rolling inflaton granting sixty or more $e$-folds of accelerated expansion for sub-Planckian values of the axion decay constant. The analysis of perturbations reveals a negative sound speed, thus signaling an instability. Implementing a Chern-Simons-type coupling between the inflaton and gauge sectors cures the instability by delivering a positive speed. We perform a numerical study of scalar and tensor perturbations for a fiducial set of parameters finding that the corresponding observables are compatible with current CMB bounds.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dark Sector (ETHOS $n=0$): Cosmological Constraints from SPT Cluster Abundance with DES and HST Weak Lensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use galaxy cluster abundance measurements from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) enhanced by Multi-Component Matched Filter (MCMF) confirmation and complemented with mass information obtained using weak-lensing data from Dark Energy Survey Year~3 (DES Y3) and targeted Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations for probing deviations from the cold dark matter paradigm. Concretely, we consider a class of dark sector models featuring interactions between dark matter (DM) and a dark radiation (DR) component within the framework of the Effective Theory of Structure Formation (ETHOS). We focus on scenarios that lead to power suppression over a wide range of scales, and thus can be tested with data sensitive to large scales, as realized for example for DM$-$DR interactions following from an unbroken non-Abelian $SU(N)$ gauge theory (interaction rate with power-law index $n=0$ within the ETHOS parameterization). Cluster abundance measurements are mostly sensitive to the amount of DR interacting with DM, parameterized by the ratio of DR temperature to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, $\xi_{\rm DR}=T_{\rm DR}/T_{\rm CMB}$. We find an upper limit $\xi_{\rm DR}&lt;17\%$ at $95\%$ credibility. When the cluster data are combined with Planck 2018 CMB data along with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements we find $\xi_{\rm DR}&lt;10\%$, corresponding to a limit on the abundance of interacting DR that is around three times tighter than that from CMB+BAO data alone. We also discuss the complementarity of weak lensing informed cluster abundance studies with probes sensitive to smaller scales, explore the impact on our analysis of massive neutrinos, and comment on a slight preference for the presence of a non-zero interacting DR abundance, which enables a physical solution to the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XV. Search for strong gravitational lenses combining ground-based and space-based imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past, researchers have mostly relied on single-resolution images from individual telescopes to detect gravitational lenses. We propose a search for galaxy-scale lenses that, for the first time, combines high-resolution single-band images (in our case the Hubble Space Telescope, HST) with lower-resolution multi-band images (in our case Legacy survey, LS) using machine learning. This methodology aims to simulate the operational strategies that will be employed by future missions, such as combining the images of Euclid and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). To compensate for the scarcity of lensed galaxy images for network training, we have generated mock lenses by superimposing arc features onto HST images, saved the lens parameters, and replicated the lens system in the LS images. We test four architectures based on ResNet-18: (1) using single-band HST images, (2) using three bands of LS images, (3) stacking these images after interpolating the LS images to HST pixel scale for simultaneous processing, and (4) merging a ResNet branch of HST with a ResNet branch of LS before the fully connected layer. We compare these architecture performances by creating Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for each model and comparing their output scores. At a false-positive rate of $10^{-4}$, the true-positive rate is $\sim$0.41, $\sim$0.45, $\sim$0.51 and $\sim$0.55, for HST, LS, stacked images and merged branches, respectively. Our results demonstrate that models integrating images from both the HST and LS significantly enhance the detection of galaxy-scale lenses compared to models relying on data from a single instrument. These results show the potential benefits of using both Euclid and LSST images, as wide-field imaging surveys are expected to discover approximately 100,000 lenses.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>

      <title>Detecting cosmological recombination lines with a non-ideal antenna -- a first step to practical realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photons emitted during the formation of primordial hydrogen and helium atoms over the Epoch of Recombination are expected to be preserved as additive distortions to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. The 'ripple' like spectral features from Cosmological Recombination Radiation (CRR) have never been detected, and are expected to be 9 orders of magnitude fainter than the CMB. Array of Precision Spectrometers for the Epoch of Recombination - APSERa - is an upcoming ground-based experiment to detect the CRR signal over 2-6 GHz. While astrophysical foregrounds may be theoretically separated from the CRR signal using their inherently different spectral characteristics, instrument generated systematics present a practical problem. We present a first ever study to detect the CRR lines in the presence of a non-ideal antenna adopting a toy model for antenna beam chromaticity. Using Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation coefficient as metrics to distinguish between CRR signal presence and absence in a simulation pipeline, we demonstrate that it is indeed possible to detect the signal using a chromatic antenna. Furthermore, we show that there are different tolerances to the antenna non-ideality based on the type of chromaticity, observing location, and LST. These can inform antenna and experiment design for a practical detection.</description>

      <title>Friedmann cosmology with hyperfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metric-affine gravity, both the gravitational and matter actions depend not just on the metric, but also on the independent affine connection. Thus matter can be modeled as a hyperfluid, characterized by both the energy-momentum and hypermomentum tensors. The latter is defined as the variation of the matter action with respect to the connection and it encodes extra (micro)properties of particles. For a homogeneous and isotropic universe, it was recently shown that the generic cosmological hypermomentum possesses five degrees of freedom: one in dilation, two in shear, and two in spin part. The aim of the current work is to present the first systematic study of the implications of this perfect hyperfluid on the universe with Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. We adopt a simple model with non-Riemannian Einstein-Hilbert gravitational action plus arbitrary hyperfluid matter, and solve analytically the cosmological equations for single and multiple component hypermomentum contributions using different assumptions about the equation of state. It is remarkable, that in a number of cases the forms of the time evolution of the Hubble function and energy density still coincide with their general relativity counterparts, only the respective indexes $\mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\mathrm{w}_\rho$ start to differ due to the hypermomentum corrections. The results and insights we obtained are very general and can assist in constructing interesting models to resolve the issues in standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Radio-loudness statistics of quasars from Quaia-VLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasars are objects of high interest for applications in extragalactic astrophysics, cosmology, and astrometry. One of their useful qualities is owed to their relativistic jets: they can be radio-loud. However, the fraction of radio-loud vs. radio-quiet quasars is subject to ongoing investigations, where the statistical power is limited by the low number of known quasars with radio counterparts. In this analysis, we revisited the radio-loudness statistics of quasars by significantly expanding the pool of known sources. Our main goal was to create a new, value-added catalogue of quasars with information about their extinction-corrected magnitudes, radio flux density, possible contamination levels, and other data flags, besides their sky coordinates and photometric redshifts. We cross-matched the optical Quaia catalogue of about 1.3 million quasars (selected from the Gaia data set) with 1.9 million sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) radio catalogue. We explored different thresholds for the matching radius, balancing the completeness and purity of the resulting Quaia-VLASS catalogue, and found that 1.5 arc seconds is a sufficient choice. Our main finding is that the radio-loud fraction of quasars is in good agreement with previous works (&lt; 10%), and there is no significant large-scale pattern in radio-loudness across the sky. The exact estimate depends on the G-band magnitude limit, and we observed some weak trends with redshift and absolute optical magnitude, possibly indicating remnant systematic effects in our data sets. The cross-matched Quaia-VLASS catalogue with 43,650 sources is available to the public for future analyses. This latest census of QSOs with radio counterparts will facilitate further investigations of the dichotomy of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, and it may also support other lines of investigations using quasars in cosmology and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new observing windows on the distant universe. Among JWST's instruments, the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) offers the unique capability of imaging observations at wavelengths $\lambda &gt; 5\mu$m. This enables unique access to the rest frame near infra-red (NIR, $\lambda \ge 1$\mum) emission from galaxies at redshifts $z&gt;4$ and the visual ($\lambda \gtrsim 5000$\AA) rest frame for $z&gt;9$. We here report on the guaranteed time observations (GTO) from the MIRI European Consortium, of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), forming the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), consisting of an on source integration time of $\sim41$ hours in the MIRI/F560W (5.6 $\mu$m) filter. To our knowledge, this constitutes the longest single filter exposure obtained with JWST of an extragalactic field as yet.</description>

      <title>To the Problem of Cosmic Expansion in Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider evolving, spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous (FLRW) cosmologies in ghost-free (dRGT) massive gravity. In this theory, no dynamical flat FLRW background exists if the reference metric is chosen to be Minkowski and the Stueckelberg fields are homogeneous. Relaxing the assumptions on the Stueckelberg profiles gives access to dynamical backgrounds. We propose a classification of the viable flat FLRW cosmological solutions of dRGT massive gravity. Instead of specifying an initial ansatz for the Stueckelberg fields $\phi^a$ and the reference metric $f_{ab}$, we show that imposing homogeneity and isotropy on the square root tensor $X^{\mu}_{\nu}=\left(\sqrt{g^{-1}\partial\phi^a \partial\phi^bf_{ab}}\right)^{\mu}_{\nu}$ leads to dynamical cosmological solutions, and we characterize their properties. These solutions become dynamical only when the Stueckelberg fields acquire a sufficiently inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic profile. We explore the consequences for the minimal model and the complete dRGT theory, and show that perturbations are strongly coupled, at the quadratic level, on these backgrounds.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Variance of the Pantheon+ Dataset: Systematics in the Covariance Matrix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the statistics of the available Pantheon+ dataset. Noticing that the $\chi^2$ value for the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model to the real data is small, we quantify how significant its smallness is by calculating the distribution of $\chi^2$ values for the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model fit to mock Pantheon+-like datasets, using the provided covariance matrix. We further investigate the distribution of the residuals of the Pantheon+ dataset with respect to the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model, and notice that they scatter less than would be expected from the covariance matrix but find no significant kurtosis. These results point to the conclusion that the Pantheon+ covariance matrix is over-estimated. One simple interpretation of these results is a $\sim$7\% overestimation of errors on SN distance moduli in Pantheon+ data. When the covariance matrix is reduced by subtracting an intrinsic scatter term from the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix, the best-fit $\chi^2$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model achieves a normal value of 1580 and no deviation from $\Lambda$CDM is detected. We further quantify how consistent the $\Lambda$CDM model is with respect to the modified data with the subtracted covariance matrix using model-independent reconstruction techniques such as the iterative smoothing method. We find that the standard model is consistent with the data. There are a number of potential explanations for this smallness of the $\chi^2$, such as a Malmquist bias at high redshift, or accounting for systematic uncertainties by adding them to the covariance matrix, thus approximating systematic uncertainties as statistical ones.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes may arise through ultra slow-roll inflation. In this work we study a toy model of ultra slow-roll inflation with a shallow dip. The ultra slow-roll stage enhances the curvature perturbations and thus the primordial scalar power spectrum. We analyze the features of the power spectrum numerically and analytically, and then give a rough estimate of the lower and upper bound of the enhancement. These large perturbations also produce second order gravitational waves, which are in the scope of future observations.</description>

      <title>Mass scaling relations for dark halos from an analytic universal outer density profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The average matter density within the turnaround scale, which demarcates where galaxies shift from clustering around a structure to joining the expansion of the Universe, is an important cosmological probe. However, a measurement of the mass enclosed by the turnaround radius is difficult. Analyses of the turnaround scale in simulated galaxy clusters place the turnaround radius at about three times the virial radius in a \(\Lambda CDM\) universe and at a (present-day) density contrast with the background matter density of the Universe of \(\delta \sim 11\). Assessing the mass at such extended distances from a cluster's center is a challenge for current mass measurement techniques. Consequently, there is a need to develop and validate new mass-scaling relations, to connect observable masses at cluster interiors with masses at greater distances. Our research aims to establish an analytical framework for the most probable mass profile of galaxy clusters, leading to novel mass scaling relations, allowing us to estimate masses at larger scales. We derive such analytical mass profiles and compare them with those from cosmological simulations. We use excursion set theory, which provides a statistical framework for the density and local environment of dark matter halos, and complement it with the spherical collapse model to follow the non-linear growth of these halos. The profile we developed analytically shows a good agreement (better than 30\%, and dependent on halo mass) with the mass profiles of simulated galaxy clusters. Mass scaling relations are obtained from the analytical profile with offset better than 15\% from the simulated ones. This level of precision highlights the potential of our model for probing structure formation dynamics at the outskirts of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Fast likelihood-free inference in the LSS Stage IV era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forthcoming large-scale structure (LSS) Stage IV surveys will provide us with unprecedented data to probe the nature of dark matter and dark energy. However, analysing these data with conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods will be challenging, due to the increase in the number of nuisance parameters and the presence of intractable likelihoods. In light of this, we present the first application of Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE) (a recent approach in simulation-based inference) to LSS photometric probes: weak lensing, galaxy clustering and the cross-correlation power spectra. In order to analyse the hundreds of spectra simultaneously, we find that a pre-compression of data using principal component analysis, as well as parameter-specific data summaries lead to highly accurate results. Using expected Stage IV experimental noise, we are able to recover the posterior distribution for the cosmological parameters with a speedup factor of $\sim 10-60$ compared to classical MCMC methods. To illustrate that the performance of MNRE is not impeded when posteriors are highly non-Gaussian, we test a scenario of two-body decaying dark matter, finding that Stage IV surveys can improve current bounds on the model by up to one order of magnitude. This result supports that MNRE is a powerful framework to constrain the standard cosmological model and its extensions with next-generation LSS surveys.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>

Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa), Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation. We note that our CMB and non-CMB data $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization cosmological constraints are discrepant at 2.7$\sigma$, a little larger than the 1.9$\sigma$ discrepancy between DESI DR1 BAO and CMB data flat $\Lambda$CDM model cosmological constraints. We also show that if we remove the Pantheon+ SNIa contribution from the non-CMB data, for the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization we still find tension between P18 and non-CMB data (2.5$\sigma$) and P18+lensing and non-CMB data (2.4$\sigma$). Even after the exclusion of Pantheon+ SNIa data the $\Lambda$CDM model is still disfavoured at $\sim 2\sigma$ c.l.</description>

      <title>Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal K\"{a}hler potential. Following previous studies that revealed that this model can overcome the $\eta$-problem found in F-term models, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties, the energy scales of both inflation and string formation influence the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by these cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity interpretation of the evolving dark energy in light of DESI data</title>

Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration has recently released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) from the first year of observations. A joint analysis of DESI BAO, CMB, and SN Ia probes indicates a preference for time-evolving dark energy. We evaluate the robustness of this preference by replacing the DESI distance measurements at $z&lt;0.8$ with the SDSS BAO measurements in a similar redshift range. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we find an evolution of the dark energy equation of state parameters consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis of $\chi^2$ statistics across various BAO datasets shows that DESI's preference for evolving dark energy is primarily driven by the two LRG samples at $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ and $z_{\rm eff}=0.71$, with the latter having the most significant impact.
  Taking this preference seriously, we study a general Horndeski scalar-tensor theory, which provides a physical mechanism to safely cross the phantom divide, $w=-1$. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we derive constraints on the parameters $w_0=-0.856\pm0.062$ and $w_a=-0.53_{-0.26}^{+0.28}$ at $68\%$ CL from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI BAO, and Pantheon+ datasets, showing good consistency with the standard $w_0w_a$CDM model. The modified gravity model gives results discrepant with $\Lambda$CDM at the $2.4\sigma$ level, while for $w_0w_a$CDM it is at $2.5\sigma$, based on the best-fit $\chi^2$ values. We conclude that modified gravity offers a viable physical explanation for DESI's preference for evolving dark energy.</description>

      <title>Stage IV baryonic feedback correction for non-Gaussianity inference</title>

Abstract: Non-Gaussian statistics of the projected weak lensing field are powerful estimators that can outperform the constraining power of the two-point functions in inferring cosmological parameters. This is because these estimators extract the non-Gaussian information contained in the small scales. However, fully leveraging the statistical precision of such estimators is hampered by theoretical uncertainties, such as those arising from baryonic physics. Moreover, as non-Gaussian estimators mix different scales, there exists no natural cut-off scale below which baryonic feedback can be completely removed. We therefore present a Bayesian solution for accounting for baryonic feedback uncertainty in weak lensing non-Gaussianity inference. Our solution implements Bayesian model averaging (BMA), a statistical framework that accounts for model uncertainty and combines the strengths of different models to produce more robust and reliable parameter inferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a Stage IV convergence peak counts analysis, including three baryonic feedback models. We find that the resulting BMA posterior distribution safeguards parameter inference against biases due to baryonic feedback, and therefore provides a robust framework for obtaining accurate cosmological constraints at Stage IV precision under model uncertainty scenarios.</description>

      <title>First step toward matter power spectrum reconstruction with Stage III weak gravitational lensing surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) surveys provide insight into the matter distribution over an extensive range of scales. Current WL results are in mild tension with cosmic microwave background measurements from the early Universe. Reconstructing the matter power spectrum from their measurements instead of condensing the information into a single cosmological parameter may help locate the origin of these differences. To investigate the cosmic shear measurements of Stage III WL surveys, we compared their tomographic data by assuming a simple parametric model for the matter power spectrum. The model allows the comparison of surveys with different characteristics and, in an agnostic approach, gives insight into the shape of the matter power spectrum preferred by the data. For the matter power spectrum, we assumed a double power-law model in scale factor and wavenumber. The best-fitting amplitude and exponents were inferred in an MCMC analysis. We identified the scales to which the data is most sensitive. We tested the sensitivity to different assumptions of the intrinsic alignment strength. We find that the constraining power of Stage III surveys on the power spectrum shape and evolution is still limited. Most information can be summarized as an overall amplitude at a pivot point in wavenumber and scale factor, while constraints on the power-law indices are considerably weaker. Nevertheless, all surveys show a weaker rate of growth from $z=$ 0.5 to 0.1 than predicted. The assumed intrinsic alignment strength is found to have no significant impact on the measured parameters and goodness of fit. Direct estimates of the matter power spectrum from Stage III weak lensing surveys can, in principle, be used to locate the physical origin of the observed $S_8$ tension. We present a simple methodology for the first steps in this direction, but find that current constraints are still weak.</description>

Abstract: This introductory guide aims to provide insight to new researchers in the field of cosmic microwave background (CMB) map analysis on best practices for several common procedures. We will discuss common map-modifying procedures such as masking, downgrading resolution, the effect of the beam and the pixel window function, and adding white noise. We will explore how these modifications affect the final power spectrum measured from a map. This guide aims to describe the best way to perform each of these procedures, when the different steps and measures should be carried out, and the effects of incorrectly performing or applying any of them.</description>

      <title>Detection of a universal core-halo transition in dwarf galaxies as predicted by Bose-Einstein dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.10337v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of large dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies has long been puzzling and many are now known to be surrounded by an extensive halo of stars. Distinctive core-halo structure is characteristic of dark matter as a Bose Einstein condensate, $\psi$DM, with a dense, soliton core predicted in every galaxy, representing the ground state, surrounded by a large, tenuous halo of excited density waves. A marked density transition is predicted between the core and the halo set by the de Broglie wavelength, as the soliton core is a prominent standing wave that is denser by over an order of magnitude than the surrounding halo. Here we identify this predicted behavior in the stellar profiles of the well known "isolated" dwarfs that lie outside the Milky Way, each with a clear density transition at $\simeq 1.0~{\rm kpc}$, implying a very light boson, $m_{\psi} \simeq 10^{-22}$eV. The classical dwarf galaxies orbiting within the Milky Way also show this predicted core-halo structure but with larger density transitions of over two orders of magnitude, that we show implies tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies by the Milky way, as the tenuous halo is more easily stripped than the stable soliton core. We conclude that dark matter as a light boson explains the observed family of classical dwarf profiles with tidal stripping included, in contrast to the standard heavy particle interpretation where low mass galaxies should be concentrated and core-less, quite unlike the core-halo structure observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of General Relativity (GR) based on a space-time foliation by three-dimensional space-like hypersurfaces labeled by the Khronon scalar field $\tau$. We show that this theory (i) leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales for stationary systems; (ii) recovers GR plus a cosmological constant in the strong field regime; (iii) is in agreement with the standard cosmological model and the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies at linear cosmological scales, where the theory reduces to a subset of the generalized dark matter (GDM) model. We compute the second order action on a Minkowski background and show that it contains the usual tensor modes of GR and a scalar degree of freedom with dispersion relation $\omega=0$. We find that the deconstrained Hamiltonian is bounded from below for wavenumbers larger than $\sim 10^{-31}\,\text{eV}$ and unbounded for smaller wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>Tomography of flavoured leptogenesis with primordial blue gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a scenario where an early epoch of matter domination is driven by the mass scale $M_N$ of the right-handed neutrinos, which also characterizes the different flavour regimes of leptogenesis. Such a matter-domination epoch gives rise to peculiar spectral imprints on primordial Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced during inflation. We point out that the characteristic spectral features are detectable in multiple frequency bands with current and future GW experiments in case of Blue GWs (BGWs) described by a power-law with a positive spectral index $(n_T &gt;0)$ and an amplitude compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements at the CMB scale. We find that the three-flavour leptogenesis regime with $M_N \lesssim 10^9~{\rm GeV}$ imprints BGWs more prominently than the two-flavour and one-flavour regimes characterized by a higher right-handed neutrino mass scale. In particular, a two-flavour (three-flavour) leptogenesis regime is expected to leave distinct imprints in the mHz-Hz ($\mu$Hz-mHz) band. Moreover, we translate the current Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and LIGO limits on the GW energy density into constraints on the flavour leptogenesis parameter space for different GW spectral indices $n_T$. We provide a rigorous statistical analysis of how the future GW detectors would be conjointly able to distinguish the flavour regimes. Interestingly, the scenario also offers unique GW signals testable in the next LIGO run with a correlated signature in the PTA frequency band with an amplitude comparable to the one expected from supermassive black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stationary processes do not accurately describe the diffuse backgrounds of relic gravitons whose correlations are homogeneous in space (i.e. only dependent upon the distance between the two spatial locations) but not in time. The symmetries of the autocorrelations ultimately reflect the quantum mechanical origin of the diffuse backgrounds and lead to non-stationary observables at late time. In particular, large oscillations are believed to arise in the spectral energy density that is customarily (but approximately) related to the tensor power spectrum. When the full expression of the spectral energy density is employed the amplitudes of oscillation are instead suppressed in the large-scale limit and the non-stationary features of the late-time signal practically disappear. For similar reasons the relations between the spectral energy density and the spectral amplitude are ambiguous in the presence of non-stationary features. While it is debatable if the non-stationary features are (or will be) directly detectable, we argue that the spectral amplitude following from the Wiener-Khintchine theorem is generally inappropriate for a consistent description of the relic signal. Nevertheless the strong oscillatory behaviour of the late-time observables is naturally smeared out provided the spectral energy density is selected as pivotal variable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication for nanohertz pulsar timing array signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: To investigate the model and extra friction term effects in standard siren (SS) data simulation of modified gravity, we simulated three types of SS data based on different fiducial models which are $\Lambda$CDM, $f(Q)|_{PE}$ and $f(Q)|_{HT}$ models. The current cosmological electromagnetic (EM) observations are combined to get fiducial parameter values for the SS simulations. The comparison between GW\Romannum{1} and GW\Romannum{2} gives out the model effect is small. The comparison between GW\Romannum{2} and GW\Romannum{3} shows the friction term will shift the values of model parameters, especially $\Omega_{m0}$.</description>

Abstract: ANNZ is a fast and simple algorithm which utilises artificial neural networks (ANNs), it was known as one of the pioneers of machine learning approaches to photometric redshift estimation decades ago. We enhanced the algorithm by introducing new activation functions like tanh, softplus, SiLU, Mish and ReLU variants; its new performance is then vigorously tested on legacy samples like the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Stripe-82 samples from SDSS, as well as modern galaxy samples like the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). This work focuses on testing the robustness of activation functions with respect to the choice of ANN architectures, particularly on its depth and width, in the context of galaxy photometric redshift estimation. Our upgraded algorithm, which we named ANNZ+, shows that the tanh and Leaky ReLU activation functions provide more consistent and stable results across deeper and wider architectures with &gt; 1 per cent improvement in root-mean-square error ($\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$) and 68th percentile error ($\sigma_{68}$) when tested on SDSS data sets. While assessing its capabilities in handling high dimensional inputs, we achieved an improvement of 11 per cent in $\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$ and 6 per cent in $\sigma_{68}$ with the tanh activation function when tested on the 40-narrowband PAUS dataset; it even outperformed ANNZ2, its supposed successor, by 44 per cent in $\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$. This justifies the effort to upgrade the 20-year-old ANNZ, allowing it to remain viable and competitive within the photo-z community today. The updated algorithm ANNZ+ is publicly available at https://github.com/imdadmpt/ANNzPlus.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II. Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy</title>

Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Preheating Axions in String Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain inflationary models can feature periods of preheating - an era preceding reheating during which parametric resonance triggers an exponential production of bosons. This non-perturbative process can have significant impact on the history of our universe, with consequences ranging from altered reheating channels to overproduction of dark radiation to overclosure. In this work, we study parametric resonance production of axions in string models of inflation. We find that the kinetic couplings and moduli-dependent axion masses give rise to generalizations of the Mathieu equation. We study these generalizations and determine the strength of parametric resonance created by such couplings. We then apply this technology to fibre inflation models in Type IIB orientifold compactifications. We find that heavy axions can be copiously produced and avoidance of overclosure results in constraints on the typical fibre inflation parameter space.</description>
