      <title>A two-phase-ACO algorithm for solving nonlinear optimization problems subjected to fuzzy relational equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate nonlinear optimization problems whose constraints are defined as fuzzy relational equations (FRE) with max-min composition. Since the feasible solution set of the FRE is often a non-convex set and the resolution of the FREs is an NP-hard problem, conventional nonlinear approaches may involve high computational complexity. Based on the theoretical aspects of the problem, an algorithm (called FRE-ACO algorithm) is presented which benefits from the structural properties of the FREs, the ability of discrete ant colony optimization algorithm (denoted by ACO) to tackle combinatorial problems, and that of continuous ant colony optimization algorithm (denoted by ACOR) to solve continuous optimization problems. In the current method, the fundamental ideas underlying ACO and ACOR are combined and form an efficient approach to solve the nonlinear optimization problems constrained with such non-convex regions. Moreover, FRE-ACO algorithm preserves the feasibility of new generated solutions without having to initially find the minimal solutions of the feasible region or check the feasibility after generating the new solutions. FRE-ACO algorithm has been compared with some related works proposed for solving nonlinear optimization problems with respect to maxmin FREs. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a higher convergence rate and requires a less number of function evaluations compared to other considered algorithms.</description>

      <title>From Frege to chatGPT: Compositionality in language, cognition, and deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositionality has long been considered a key explanatory property underlying human intelligence: arbitrary concepts can be composed into novel complex combinations, permitting the acquisition of an open ended, potentially infinite expressive capacity from finite learning experiences. Influential arguments have held that neural networks fail to explain this aspect of behavior, leading many to dismiss them as viable models of human cognition. Over the last decade, however, modern deep neural networks (DNNs), which share the same fundamental design principles as their predecessors, have come to dominate artificial intelligence, exhibiting the most advanced cognitive behaviors ever demonstrated in machines. In particular, large language models (LLMs), DNNs trained to predict the next word on a large corpus of text, have proven capable of sophisticated behaviors such as writing syntactically complex sentences without grammatical errors, producing cogent chains of reasoning, and even writing original computer programs -- all behaviors thought to require compositional processing. In this chapter, we survey recent empirical work from machine learning for a broad audience in philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, situating recent breakthroughs within the broader context of philosophical arguments about compositionality. In particular, our review emphasizes two approaches to endowing neural networks with compositional generalization capabilities: (1) architectural inductive biases, and (2) metalearning, or learning to learn. We also present findings suggesting that LLM pretraining can be understood as a kind of metalearning, and can thereby equip DNNs with compositional generalization abilities in a similar way. We conclude by discussing the implications that these findings may have for the study of compositionality in human cognition and by suggesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Four Prominent Ant Colony Optimization Variants: Ant System, Rank-Based Ant System, Max-Min Ant System, and Ant Colony System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research conducts a comparative analysis of four Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) variants -- Ant System (AS), Rank-Based Ant System (ASRank), Max-Min Ant System (MMAS), and Ant Colony System (ACS) -- for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Our findings demonstrate that algorithm performance is significantly influenced by problem scale and instance type. ACS excels in smaller TSP instances due to its rapid convergence, while PACS proves more adaptable for medium-sized problems. MMAS consistently achieves competitive results across all scales, particularly for larger instances, due to its ability to avoid local optima. ASRank, however, struggles to match the performance of the other algorithms. This research provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these ACO variants, guiding the selection of the most suitable algorithm for specific TSP applications.</description>

      <title>E(n) Equivariant Topological Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how several E(n) equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different nature: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The experiment results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, highlighting the benefits of principled geometric inductive bias.</description>

      <title>Randomized heuristic repair for large-scale multidimensional knapsack problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem whose solution is determining a subset of maximum total profit items that do not violate capacity constraints. Due to its hardness, large-scale MKP instances are usually a target for metaheuristics, a context in which effective feasibility maintenance strategies are crucial. In 1998, Chu and Beasley proposed an effective heuristic repair that is still relevant for recent metaheuristics. However, due to its deterministic nature, the diversity of solutions such heuristic provides is insufficient for long runs. As a result, the search for new solutions ceases after a while. This paper proposes an efficiency-based randomization strategy for the heuristic repair that increases the variability of the repaired solutions without deteriorating quality and improves the overall results.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic dreaming: A pathway to efficient learning in artificial agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving energy efficiency in learning is a key challenge for artificial intelligence (AI) computing platforms. Biological systems demonstrate remarkable abilities to learn complex skills quickly and efficiently. Inspired by this, we present a hardware implementation of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) using spiking neural networks (SNNs) on mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic hardware. This approach leverages the energy efficiency of mixed-signal neuromorphic chips while achieving high sample efficiency through an alternation of online learning, referred to as the "awake" phase, and offline learning, known as the "dreaming" phase. The model proposed includes two symbiotic networks: an agent network that learns by combining real and simulated experiences, and a learned world model network that generates the simulated experiences. We validate the model by training the hardware implementation to play the Atari game Pong. We start from a baseline consisting of an agent network learning without a world model and dreaming, which successfully learns to play the game. By incorporating dreaming, the number of required real game experiences are reduced significantly compared to the baseline. The networks are implemented using a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor, with the readout layers trained using a computer in-the-loop, while the other layers remain fixed. These results pave the way toward energy-efficient neuromorphic learning systems capable of rapid learning in real world applications and use-cases.</description>

      <title>MLPs Learn In-Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), the remarkable ability to solve a task from only input exemplars, has commonly been assumed to be a unique hallmark of Transformer models. In this study, we demonstrate that multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can also learn in-context. Moreover, we find that MLPs, and the closely related MLP-Mixer models, learn in-context competitively with Transformers given the same compute budget. We further show that MLPs outperform Transformers on a subset of ICL tasks designed to test relational reasoning. These results suggest that in-context learning is not exclusive to Transformers and highlight the potential of exploring this phenomenon beyond attention-based architectures. In addition, MLPs' surprising success on relational tasks challenges prior assumptions about simple connectionist models. Altogether, our results endorse the broad trend that ``less inductive bias is better" and contribute to the growing interest in all-MLP alternatives to task-specific architectures.</description>
