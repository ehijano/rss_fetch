      <title>Heterogeneity in peer effects for binary outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce heterogeneity into the analysis of peer effects that arise from conformity, allowing the strength of the taste for conformity to vary across agents' actions. Using a structural model based on a simultaneous network game with incomplete information, I derive conditions for equilibrium uniqueness and for the identification of heterogeneous peer-effect parameters. I also propose specification tests to determine whether the conformity model or the spillover model is consistent with the observed data in the presence of heterogeneous peer effects. Applying the model to data on smoking and alcohol consumption among secondary school students, I show that assuming a homogeneous preference for conformity leads to biased estimates.</description>

      <title>Confidence Sets for the Emergence, Collapse, and Recovery Dates of a Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose constructing confidence sets for the emergence, collapse, and recovery dates of a bubble by inverting tests for the location of the break date. We examine both likelihood ratio-type tests and the Elliott-Muller-type (2007) tests for detecting break locations. The limiting distributions of these tests are derived under the null hypothesis, and their asymptotic consistency under the alternative is established. Finite-sample properties are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that combining different types of tests effectively controls the empirical coverage rate while maintaining a reasonably small length of the confidence set.</description>

      <title>Quantile Selection in the Gender Pay Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to estimate selection-corrected quantiles of the gender wage gap. Our method employs instrumental variables that explain variation in the latent variable but, conditional on the latent process, do not directly affect selection. We provide semiparametric identification of the quantile parameters without imposing parametric restrictions on the selection probability, derive the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator based on constrained selection probability weighting, and demonstrate how the approach applies to the Roy model of labor supply. Using German administrative data, we analyze the distribution of the gender gap in full-time earnings. We find pronounced positive selection among women at the lower end, especially those with less education, which widens the gender gap in this segment, and strong positive selection among highly educated men at the top, which narrows the gender wage gap at upper quantiles.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Semiparametric Causal Inference: Targeted Doubly Robust Estimation of Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a semiparametric Bayesian methodology for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) within the potential outcomes framework using observational data with high-dimensional nuisance parameters. Our method introduces a Bayesian debiasing procedure that corrects for bias arising from nuisance estimation and employs a targeted modeling strategy based on summary statistics rather than the full data. These summary statistics are identified in a debiased manner, enabling the estimation of nuisance bias via weighted observables and facilitating hierarchical learning of the ATE. By combining debiasing with sample splitting, our approach separates nuisance estimation from inference on the target parameter, reducing sensitivity to nuisance model specification. We establish that, under mild conditions, the marginal posterior for the ATE satisfies a Bernstein-von Mises theorem when both nuisance models are correctly specified and remains consistent and robust when only one is correct, achieving Bayesian double robustness. This ensures asymptotic efficiency and frequentist validity. Extensive simulations confirm the theoretical results, demonstrating accurate point estimation and credible intervals with nominal coverage, even in high-dimensional settings. The proposed framework can also be extended to other causal estimands, and its key principles offer a general foundation for advancing Bayesian semiparametric inference more broadly.</description>

      <title>Possibilistic Instrumental Variable Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variable regression is a common approach for causal inference in the presence of unobserved confounding. However, identifying valid instruments is often difficult in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on possibility theory that performs posterior inference on the treatment effect, conditional on a user-specified set of potential violations of the exogeneity assumption. Our method can provide informative results even when only a single, potentially invalid, instrument is available, offering a natural and principled framework for sensitivity analysis. Simulation experiments and a real-data application indicate strong performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Large datasets for the Euro Area and its member countries and the dynamic effects of the common monetary policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce EA-MD-QD, a new publicly available dataset comprising 1136 macroeconomic time series for the euro area (EA) and its ten largest member countries observed at monthly or quarterly frequency. Since January 2024, EA-MD-QD has been updated monthly and continuously revised, providing a valuable resource for policy analysis in the EA. Using EA-MD-QD, we study country-specific impulse responses to an EA-wide monetary policy shock. Results reveal moderate yet significant cross-country heterogeneity, with a core-periphery pattern in prices and interest rates and meaningful differences in real activity, while stock price responses are relatively homogeneous. Evidence points to homeownership and saving behavior as potential drivers of the observed cross-country differences.</description>
