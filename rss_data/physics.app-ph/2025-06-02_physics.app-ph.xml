      <title>Terahertz prototype for air pollutants detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a prototype set-up exploiting terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to investigate gaseous compounds. The system is portable and allows to perform remote measurements. We used the prototype to characterise for the first time in literature over a broad THz range, pure dichloromethane and chloroform, two pollutants known as very short-lived substances (VSLS) that strongly contribute to ozone depletion. The THz range allows selectively detecting their absorption lines related to the rotational molecular motion for which we also present the theoretical confirmation. Then, we investigate the optical response of a multi-component mixture achieved with the two aforementioned chlorine-based compounds mixed with two widely distributed volatile pollutants (acetone and methanol). For these first measurements, we developed the set-up specifically for laboratory condition in which the substances are directly injected into the gas-cell circuit. Finally, we modified the prototype to ensure that the ambient atmosphere is drawn directly into the gas cell via a long pipe and a suction system opportunely developed. The analysis of the mixtures in both laboratory and in-field conditions demonstrates that the prototype together with the approach employed in this work can simultaneously identify and quantify single components in the atmosphere. The results obtained open up new possibilities for the development and applications of an efficient portable THz-based sensor for the remote detection of multi-component environmental contaminants.</description>

      <title>Observation of ferron transport in ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics feature spontaneous electric dipolar order reconfigurable via electric fields. Recent theoretical studies of the collective excitations of this electric dipolar order give rise to the hope that "ferron" quasiparticles may complement the magnons of magnetic materials in information and heat management technologies. Yet direct experimental evidence of ferron transport remains elusive. Here we demonstrate efficient ferron injection and detection enabled by ferromagnetic metal contacts, achieving nonlocal signal transmission over micrometer distances in a prototypical ferroelectric PMN-PT. The transmission efficiency can be switched by external magnetic fields that couple to the contacts and gate electric fields that control the ferron excitations. Ferron-based devices open new power saving strategies that employ ferroelectric materials in a future sustainable information society.</description>

      <title>A Planar Huygens Antenna Utilizing Crossed Electric and Magnetic Dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural source of a magnetic dipole in antennas is typically an electrically small loop, which can be utilized in conjunction with an electric dipole to realize an electrically small Huygens' antenna. However, these antennas suffer from low radiation efficiency and their theoretical directivity limit is 4.8 dBi. Magnetic dipoles with an electrical size larger than 0.5lambda are highly desirable for high-gain applications. This paper builds on the development of a magnetic dipole source that utilizes a 0.5lambda slot positioned near a printed dipole with a length twice that of the slot. Such a combination of electric and magnetic dipoles yields a highly directive radiation pattern, resulting in a higher gain than a uniformly illuminated antenna of similar size. The prototype is designed to operate at 4.5 GHz, with a directivity of up to 8.37 dBi. The analytical, numerical, and measured results agree fully. This high-gain superdirective antenna is highly desirable due to its excellent features, including being low-profile, PCB compatible, and having a low-complexity feeding topology, compared to the existing approach of the two-element end-fire array.</description>

      <title>Exploring Domain Wall Pinning in Ferroelectrics via Automated High Throughput AFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain-wall dynamics in ferroelectric materials are strongly position-dependent since each polar interface is locked into a unique local microstructure. This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the wall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers and preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding the use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human experimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$ were investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the polar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall displacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local ferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration. For example, twin boundaries in polydomains regions like a$_1^-$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stay pinned up to a certain level of bias magnitude and change only marginally as the bias increases from 20V to 30V, whereas single variant boundaries like a$_2^+$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stack are already activated at 20V. These statistics on the possible ferroelectric and ferroelastic wall orientations, together with the automated, high-throughput AFM workflow, can be distilled into a predictive map that links domain configurations to pulse parameters. This microstructure-specific rule set forms the foundation for designing ferroelectric memories.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Characterization of Thin Film MoS$_2$ Using Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lithium niobate multi-functional platform (LN-MFP) that integrates photoacoustic and thermoelastic spectroscopy with photodetection on a single chip. Utilizing LN's piezoelectric and thermoelastic properties and an optimized design, it achieves high sensitivity across visible to long-wave infrared wavelengths.

      <title>High resolution up-conversion imaging in the 10 {\mu}m band under incoherent illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-wavelength infrared band exhibits significant utility in thermal signature acquisition and molecular spectral analysis, among other applications. The up-conversion detection technique enables effective signal transduction into the detection bandwidth of silicon-based photodetectors, thereby facilitating high-sensitivity photonic measurements. We realized high-resolution up-conversion imaging for incoherent thermal targets in the 10 {\mu}m spectral regime for the first time. Furthermore, this work presents the first derivation of analytical models characterizing depth of field and astigmatic aberration in up-conversion imaging systems, which show excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results. The results demonstrate generalisability to various up-conversion imaging systems, thus providing critical insights for the design and optimisation of such systems.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Local Electrostatic Potential and Temperature-Driven Atomistic Forming Mechanisms in TaOx/HfO2-Based ReRAMs using Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) with a bilayer TaOx/HfO2 stack structure have been shown to possess uniquely promising resistive switching characteristics. However, the key atomistic forming mechanisms and the physical processes that govern the behavior of this kind of device remain to be clarified. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the physical mechanisms underlying its forming at the atomistic level through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an extended charge equilibration scheme to describe the effects of applied voltage with the charge transfer ionic potential formalism. The displacement of the tantalum ions was found to be the highest, followed by that of the hafnium ions, in response to a sufficiently high applied voltage across the electrodes, whereas the oxygen ions had a relatively minor voltage-driven response. This led to the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode acting as the anode and the clustering of oxygen vacancies that nucleated into the filament near the negative bottom electrode, or the cathode. This process resulted in partial shielding of the bulk dielectric from the applied voltage. We found a minimum threshold voltage was required to initiate vacancy clustering to form the filament. Filament growth during forming is attributed to a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which get stabilized by the local electric fields near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.</description>

      <title>System-integrated intrinsic static-dynamic pressure sensing enabled by charge excitation and 3D gradient engineering for autonomous robotic interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution pressure sensing that distinguishes static and dynamic inputs is vital for intelligent robotics but remains challenging for self-powered sensors. We present a self-powered intrinsic static-dynamic pressure sensor (iSD Sensor) that integrates charge excitation with a 3D gradient-engineered structure, achieving enhanced voltage outputs-over 25X for static and 15X for dynamic modes. The sensor exhibits multi-region sensitivities (up to 34.7 V/kPa static, 48.4 V/kPa dynamic), a low detection limit of 6.13 Pa, and rapid response/recovery times (83/43 ms). This design enables nuanced tactile perception and supports dual-mode robotic control: proportional actuation via static signals and fast triggering via dynamic inputs. Integrated into a wireless closed-loop system, the iSD Sensor enables precise functions such as finger bending, object grasping, and sign language output.</description>

      <title>Magnetoimpedance properties of CoNbZr, multilayer CoNbZr/Au and multilayer NiFe/Au thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin-film magnetic sensors using the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect show great promise for sensitive low-field magnetic measurements. Optimising sensor performance requires a thorough understanding of the properties of various soft magnetic materials. This study examines the electric, magnetic, and GMI properties of sputtered single-layer amorphous CoNbZr, multilayer amorphous CoNbZr/Au, and crystalline NiFe/Au thin films. GMI measurements reveal distinct ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequencies: 1.4 GHz for CoNbZr, 0.7 GHz for CoNbZr/Au, and 0.5 GHz for NiFe/Au. Au interlayers improve the GMI response, increasing the GMI ratio by 50% and reducing FMR frequency compared to single-layer CoNbZr. The highest GMI ratio of 300% occurs in a 20 $\mu$m x 5000 $\mu$m CoNbZr/Au strip at 1.8 GHz under 2 mT, while NiFe/Au exhibits 280% at 4 mT. These differences are linked to variations in in-plane demagnetising factors and saturation magnetisations, emphasising the role of material and geometry in GMI sensor performance.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Camera: Scaling Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors for Imaging at the Quantum-Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as essential devices that push the boundaries of photon detection with unprecedented sensitivity, ultrahigh timing precision, and broad spectral response. Recent advancements in materials engineering, superconducting electronics integration, and cryogenic system design are enabling the evolution of SNSPDs from single-pixel detectors toward scalable arrays and large-format single-photon time tagging cameras. This perspective article surveys the rapidly evolving technological landscape underpinning this transition, focusing on innovative superconducting materials, advanced multiplexed read-out schemes, and emerging cryo-compatible electronics. We highlight how these developments are set to profoundly impact diverse applications, including quantum communication networks, deep-tissue biomedical imaging, single-molecule spectroscopy, remote sensing with unprecedented resolution, and the detection of elusive dark matter signals. By critically discussing both current challenges and promising solutions, we aim to articulate a clear, coherent vision for the next generation of SNSPD-based quantum imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of k-Gaps in Dynamically Modulated Phononic Time Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet time crystals, characterized by momentum gaps (k-gaps), have sparked intense interest across various branches of physics due to their intriguing dynamics and promising applications. Despite growing theoretical efforts, the realization and observation of phononic time crystals, especially for airborne sound, remain significant experimental challenges. In this work, we demonstrate a phononic time crystal by integrating discrete resonant meta-atoms into a one-dimensional acoustic waveguide, effectively creating a homogeneous, time-varying metamaterial. By dynamically modulating the effective compressibility, we experimentally observe exponential acoustic wave amplification, offering clear evidence of k-gap formation. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of our platform by inducing momentum band folding and double k-gap phenomena via quasi-periodic temporal modulation. This flexible and reconfigurable approach not only enables the design of tailor-made resonant responses but also opens new avenues for realizing higher-dimensional phononic time crystals and exploring nontrivial topological dynamics in time-modulated media.</description>
