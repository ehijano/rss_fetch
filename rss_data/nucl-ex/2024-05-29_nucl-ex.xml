      <title>Ab-initio electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays and their impact on $V_{ud}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections are essential for an accurate determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed $\beta$ decays. In view of recent progress in the single-nucleon sector, the uncertainty is dominated by the theoretical description of nucleus-dependent effects, limiting the precision that can currently be achieved for $V_{ud}$. In this work, we provide a detailed account of the electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory (EFT), including the power counting, potential and ultrasoft contributions, and factorization in the decay rate. We present a first numerical evaluation of the dominant corrections in light nuclei based on Quantum Monte Carlo methods, confirming the expectations from the EFT power counting. Finally, we discuss strategies how to extract from data the low-energy constants that parameterize short-distance contributions and whose values are not predicted by the EFT. Combined with advances in ab-initio nuclear-structure calculations, this EFT framework allows one to systematically address the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$, as illustrated in detail for the $^{14}$O $\to$ $^{14}$N transition.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of $V_{ud}$ determinations from superallowed $\beta$ decays critically hinges on control over radiative corrections. Recently, substantial progress has been made on the single-nucleon, universal corrections, while nucleus-dependent effects, typically parameterized by a quantity $\delta_\text{NS}$, are much less well constrained. Here, we lay out a program to evaluate this correction from effective field theory (EFT), highlighting the dominant terms as predicted by the EFT power counting. Moreover, we compare the results to a dispersive representation of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and show that the expected momentum scaling applies even in the case of low-lying intermediate states. Our EFT framework paves the way towards ab-initio calculations of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and thereby addresses the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin impurity from Coulomb core-polarization in $^{208}\text{Pb}$: Insights from PREX-II and validation via $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$IAS reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impurity in the neutron skin induced by Coulomb core-polarization, highlighting its impact on uncertainties in neutron skin measurements from PREX-II. This effect is validated using the $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$IAS reaction at 420 MeV. Our findings reveal that the Coulomb boundary radius, where core-polarization becomes negligible, is critical for accurately probing the neutron skin in the target nucleus. Notably, the $(^{3}\text{He}, t)$IAS experiment conducted by Zegers et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 202501 (2007)] primarily detects neutron excess at zero scattering angle due to the core-polarization phenomenon, rather than the neutron skin. We propose extending this experiment to measure cross sections at a 3$^\circ$ angle to more precisely determine the neutron skin thickness in $^{208}\text{Pb}$. Additionally, uncertainties in PREX-II may arise from electrons initially probing neutron excess instead of the neutron skin, potentially leading to an overestimation of neutron skin thickness due to the mixing effect where protons are displaced into the neutron skin region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALICE experiment has undergone a major detector upgrade for Run 3, expanding its detection capabilities for a wide variety of studies. The new continuous readout has significantly enhanced the physics potential for ultra-peripheral collision analyses. In this talk, we discussed some of the physics analyses that can be carried out in ultra-peripheral collisions using the Run 3 data and presented some of the first physics performance plots in both proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Towards the understanding of heavy quarks hadronization: from leptonic to heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of hadrons is a fundamental process in nature that can be investigated at particle colliders. As several recent findings demonstrate, with \ensuremath{\mathrm{e^+e^-}}\xspace collisions as a "vacuum-like" reference at one extreme, and central AA as a dense, extended-size system characterized by flow and local equilibrium at the opposite extreme, different collision systems offer a lever arm that can be exploited to probe with a range of heavy-flavour hadron species the onset of various hadronization processes. In this review, we present an overview of the theoretical and experimental developments. The focus is on open-heavy-flavour measurements. The comparison with model predictions and connections among the results in electron-positron, proton--proton, proton--nucleus, nucleus--nucleus collisions are discussed. After reviewing the current state, we suggest some prospects and future developments.</description>

      <title>Measuring differential particle correlations in relativistic nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependencies of Symmetric and Asymmetric Correlations (SC and ASC) with one and two particles of interest in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. Leveraging the AMPT model, the investigation delves into the sensitivity of these correlations to the final state effects, providing valuable insights into their potential for constraining the final state effects' $p_T$ dependencies. The HIJING model is employed as a benchmark for non-flow correlations, shedding light on their impact on interpreting SC and ASC data. Moreover, the study points out that differential SC and ASC with one and two particles of interest (POIs) typically incorporate contributions from event-plane angle fluctuations. Consequently, this work highlights the significance of SC and ASC with one and two POIs as valuable tools for investigating the $p_T$ nature of the final state effects and advocates for comprehensive experimental measurements across various beam energies and system sizes to enhance our understanding and provide additional constraints for theoretical models.</description>

      <title>An $\textit{ab initio}$ recipe for taming nuclear-structure dependence of $ V_{ud} $: the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first ab initio calculation of the nuclear-structure-dependent radiative correction $ \delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } $ to the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition, computed with the no-core shell model and chiral effective field theory. We obtain $\delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } = - 0.400 (29)_{ \mathrm{nuc} } (12)_{n,\mathrm{el} } $ with a $1.7$-times reduction in the nuclear uncertainty when compared to the current literature estimate based on the shell model and Fermi gas picture. This work paves the way for a precise determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed beta decays.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous double alpha decay: First experimental limit and prospects of investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.12005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear decays with simultaneous emission of two alpha particles are energetically possible for a number of nuclides. Prospects of searching for such kind of decay for nuclides present in the natural isotopic composition of elements are discussed here. The first experimental limit on half-life for 2alpha decay is set for 209Bi as T1/2 &gt; 2.9e20 y at 90% C.L., using the data of work [P. de Marcillac et al., Nature 422 (2003) 876]. Theoretical T1/2 estimations for the process are also given. Using these values, which are on the level of 1e33 y or more, one can conclude that the prospects of experimental observation of 2alpha decay are very pessimistic.</description>

      <title>Study of proton-unbound states in $^{24}{\rm Al}$ relevant for the $^{23}{\rm Mg}(p,\gamma)$ reaction in novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The nucleosynthesis of several proton-rich nuclei is determined by radiative proton-capture reactions on unstable nuclei in nova explosions. One such reaction is $^{23}{\rm Mg}(p,\gamma)^{24}{\rm Al}$, which links the NeNa and MgAl cycles in oxygen-neon (ONe) novae.
  Purpose: To extract $^{23}{\rm Mg}(p,\gamma)$ resonance strengths from a study of proton-unbound states in $^{24}{\rm Al}$, produced via the $^{24}$Mg($^{3}$He,$t$) reaction.
  Methods: A beam of $^3 {\rm He}^{2+}$ ions at 50.7 MeV was used to produce the states of interest in $^{24}$Al. Proton-triton angular correlations were measured with a $K=600$ QDD magnetic spectrometer and a silicon detector array, located at iThemba LABS, South Africa.
  Results: We measured the excitation energies of the four lowest proton-unbound states in $^{24}$Al and place lower-limits on $\Gamma_p/\Gamma$ values for these four states. Together with shell-model calculations of partial gamma widths, the experimental data are also used to determine resonance strengths for the three lowest $^{23}{\rm Mg}(p,\gamma)^{24}{\rm Al}$ resonances.
  Conclusions: The energy of the dominant first $^{23}{\rm Mg}(p,\gamma)$ resonance is determined to be $E_{r} = 478 \pm 4$ keV, with a resonance strength $\omega \gamma = 19 \pm 9$ meV.</description>

      <title>Mass measurements in the $^{132}$Sn region with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on new precision mass measurements of neutron-rich $^{137}$Sb and $^{136-142}$I isotopes from the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer. We confirm the value from the previous Penning-trap measurement of $^{137}$Sb at the Canadian Penning Trap and therefore rule out the conflicting result from the Experimental Storage Ring. The ground state and isomer in $^{136}$I were resolved and measured directly for the first time. The isomer excitation energy, $E_x = 215.1(43)$ keV, agrees with the literature but is three times more precise. The measurements have improved the precision of the mass values and confirmed previous results in the majority of cases. However, for $^{138,140}$I the results differ by 17(6) keV and 23(12) keV, respectively. This could be explained by an unresolved contamination or different ratio of unresolved isomeric states in the case of $^{140}$I.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent past, a comprehensive experimental program has been worked out at the Mainz Energy-Recovery Superconducting Accelerator, MESA, at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Mainz. MESA is a high-intensity, low-energy electron accelerator presently under construction and will thereby provide great opportunities to perform a new generation of high-precision scattering experiments. The versatile MAGIX experiment will use MESA's innovative energy recovery technique, with a science focus on the study of hadron structure and few-body systems, dark sector searches, and investigations into reactions pertinent to nuclear astrophysics. An external beam line will supply spin-polarized electrons to the P2 experiment, enabling the performance of sensitive tests of the Standard Model through parity-violating electron scattering. The DarkMESA beam dump experiment, situated behind P2, is dedicated to the search for light dark matter particles.</description>

      <title>Results from the CsI Calorimeter onboard the 2023 ComPair Balloon Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ComPair gamma-ray telescope is a technology demonstrator for a future gamma-ray telescope called the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO). The instrument is composed of four subsystems, a double-sided silicon strip detector, a virtual Frisch grid CdZnTe calorimeter, a CsI:Tl based calorimeter, and an anti-coincidence detector (ACD). The CsI calorimeter's goal is to measure the position and energy deposited from high-energy events. To demonstrate the technological readiness, the calorimeter has flown onboard a NASA scientific balloon as part of the GRAPE-ComPair mission and accumulated around 3 hours of float time at an altitude of 40 km. During the flight, the CsI calorimeter observed background radiation, Regener-Pfotzer Maximum, and several gamma-ray activation lines originating from aluminum.</description>
