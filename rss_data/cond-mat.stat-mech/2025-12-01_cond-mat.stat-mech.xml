      <title>Shaping Causality: Emergence of Nonlocal Light Cones in Long-Range Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While for non-relativistic short-range interactions, the spread of information is local, remaining confined in an effective light cone, long-range interactions can generate either nonlocal (faster-than-ballistic) or local (ballistic) spread of correlations depending on the initial conditions. This makes long-range interactions a rich platform for controlling the spread of information. Here, we derive an effective Hamiltonian analytically and identify the specific interaction term that drives nonlocality in a wide class of long-range spin chains. This allows us to understand the conditions for the emergence of local behavior in the presence of nonlocal interactions and to identify a regime where the causal space-time landscape can be precisely designed. Indeed, we show that for large long-range interaction strength or large system size, initial conditions can be chosen in a way that allows a local perturbation to generate nonlocal signals at programmable distant positions, which then propagate within effective light cones. The possibility of engineering the emergence of nonlocal Lieb-Robinson-like light cones allows one to shape the causal landscape of long-range interacting systems, with direct applications to quantum information processing devices, quantum memories, error correction, and information transport in programmable quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Entropy production and non-Gaussianity of fast processes at weak damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method of estimating the rate of entropy production in underdamped dynamics by decomposing it into contributions originating in different non-equilibrium effects. Specifically, a non-zero average velocity, a non-thermal width of the velocity distribution, correlations between position and velocity and non-Gaussian velocity statistics represent different ways in which the system can be out of equilibrium and each give rise to a positive contribution to the overall entropy production rate. We demonstrate that each contribution can be separately estimated from experimental trajectory data of levitated nano-particles subject to non-linear forces. We find that the majority of the entropy production rate can be attributed to the first three contributions which can be estimated from the first and second moments of the position and velocity and therefore result in a useful \enquote{Gaussian} estimate for the entropy production rate.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for one-dimensional spin models with Markov property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For one-dimensional spin and pseudospin models that allow mapping to a Markov chain, the free energy of the system at a finite temperature can be expressed in terms of bond concentrations. Minimizing the free energy function makes it possible to obtain an exact solution of a statistical model. A dilute Ising chain with interacting impurities is considered as an example.</description>

      <title>Inferring Tree Structure with Hidden Traps from First Passage Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the movement of tracer particles has long been a strategy for uncovering complex structures. Here, we study discrete-time random walks on finite Cayley trees to infer key parameters such as tree depth and geometric bias toward the root or leaves. By analyzing first passage properties, we show that the first two first-passage-time factorial moments (FPTFMs) uniquely determine the tree structure. However, if the random walker experiences waiting phases -- due to sticky branch walls or presence of traps -- this identification becomes nontrivial. We demonstrate that the generating function of the first passage time (FPT) distribution decomposes into contributions from the waiting time distribution and the random walk without waiting, leading to a nonlinear system of equations relating the factorial moments of the waiting time distribution and the FPTFMs of random walks with and without waiting. For geometrically distributed waiting times, additional moment measurements do not suffice, but unique determination of the structure is achieved by varying initial conditions or fitting the Fourier transform of the FPT distribution to measured data. The latter method remains effective also for power-law waiting time distributions, where higher-order FPTFMs are undefined. These results provide a framework for reconstructing tree-like networks from FPT data, with applications in biological transport and spatial networks.</description>

      <title>Exact four-vector work distribution and covariant Jarzynski's equality for a relativistic particle in an expanding piston</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium four-vector work in an expanding relativistic piston. By deriving the exact work distribution in this pedagogical model, we verify the covariant form of Jarzynski's equality. We find that the joint distribution of four-vector work $(W^0, W^1)$ concentrates on the origin and some curves in the $(W^0, W^1)$ space, rather than being smoothly distributed. In the non-relativistic limit, our model consistently recovers the non-relativistic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the momentum component of four-vector work remains significant in both the Lorentz-relativistic and Galilean-relativistic frameworks. In addition, we introduce a novel geometrical technique for analyzing the dynamics of relativistic collision processes, which can be straightforwardly extended to three-dimensional piston models.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of residual entropy of hexagonal and cubic ices from tensor network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing question of whether the residual entropy of hexagonal ice ($S_h$) equals that of cubic ice ($S_c$) remains unresolved despite decades of research on ice-type models. While analytical studies have established the inequality $S_h \geq S_c$, numerical investigations suggest that the two values are very close. In this work, we revisit this problem using high-precision tensor-network methods. In Monte Carlo approaches the residual entropy cannot be directly obtained by sampling the ground-state degeneracy space, however, the tensor-network framework enables an explicit encoding of the "ice rule'' into local tensors, and then the residual entropy is transformed into finding the largest eigenvalue of a transfer operator in the form of a projected entangled-pair operator, which allows high-accuracy numerical evaluation. Meanwhile, we propose a new perspective based on analyzing the normality of the transfer operator, and demonstrate that if the operator is normal, the equality $S_h = S_c$ follows directly. Then the variational tensor network methods are employed to numerically verify this normality. Finally both residual entropies are directly computed by using our recently developed split corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm, providing a rigorous evidence supporting the equality between $S_h$ and $S_c$.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing symmetry breaking dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling and phase transition in large deviations of dynamical observables of stationary Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large deviations, over a long time window $T \to \infty$, of the dynamical observables $A_n = \int_{0}^{T} x^n(t) dt$, $n=3,4,\dots$, where $x(t)$ is a centered stationary Gaussian process in continuous time. We show that, for short-correlated processes the probability density of $A_n$ exhibits an anomalous scaling $P(A_n,T) \sim \exp[-T^{\mu} f_n(\Delta A_n T^{-\nu})]$ at $T\to \infty$ while keeping $\Delta A_n T^{-\nu}$ constant. Here $\Delta A_n$ is the deviation of $A_n$ from its ensemble average. The anomalous exponents $\mu$ and $\nu$ depend on $n$ and are smaller than $1$, whereas the rate function $f_n(z)$ exhibits a first-order dynamical phase transition (DPT) which resembles condensation transitions observed in many systems. The same type of anomaly and DPT, with the same $\mu$ and $\nu$, was previously uncovered for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process - the only stationary Gaussian process which is also Markovian. We also uncover an anomalous behavior and a similar DPT in the long-correlated Gaussian processes. However, the anomalous exponents $\mu$ and $\nu$ are determined in this case not only by $n$ but also by the power-law long-time decay $\sim |t|^{-\alpha}$ of the covariance. The different anomalous scaling behavior is a consequence of a faster-than-linear scaling with $T$ of the variance of $A_n$. Finally, for sufficiently long-ranged correlations, $\alpha&lt;2/n$, the DPT disappears, giving way to a smooth crossover between the regions of typical, Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations. The basic mechanism behind the DPT is the existence of strongly localized optimal paths of the process conditioned on very large $A_n$ and coexistence between the localized and delocalized paths of the conditioned process. Our theoretical predictions are corroborated by replica-exchange Wang-Landau simulations where we could probe probability densities down to $10^{-200}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a historical review of anyon and exclusion statistics, introduced in the 1980s and 1990s respectively, and then turn to developments in the recently introduced inclusion statistics. In contrast to exclusion statistics, where particles tend to be more exclusive than usual fermions, inclusion statistics particles tend to be more gregarious than usual bosons and manifest an enhanced propensity to form condensates. Inclusion and exclusion statistics are related through a duality transformation, generalizing the well-known Bose-Fermi duality. We conclude with a review of the Calogero model realization of exclusion statistics and its extension to inclusion statistics.</description>

      <title>Generation of concurrence in a generalized central spin model with a three-spin interacting environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-spin Ising model to study the effect of three-spin interacting term on bi-partitie entanglement between adjacent spins. The three-dominated disordered region has tri-partite entanglement causing a vanishingly small concurrence, while it acquires maximum value around the critical points. Considering the above model as an environment, we construct a generalized central spin model where two central spins, initially in an unentangled pure state, are coupled locally to two distinct sites of the environmental spin chain. We study the generation of mixed state entanglement between the central spins when the transverse field of the environment is kept fixed, and suddenly quenched, referring to equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of the central spins, respectively. For the critical environment in the equilibrium, the concurrence shows a dip-revival structure governed by quasi-particle movement. In the non-equilibrium study, we find an initial growth of concurrence followed by a two-stage fall for the inter-phase quench which is governed by dynamic decoherence channels. The central spins are maximally entangled for a quench in the vicinity of a multicritical point, which arises due to three-spin interaction only. The concurrence becomes long-lived for an intra-phase quench, and this sustainability depends on the strength of the three-spin interaction. Therefore, the three-spin interaction indeed helps in generating bi-partite entanglement in the central spins.</description>

      <title>Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy fluctuations of pinned elastic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the atypical fluctuations of the ground state energy of the random elastic manifold, a disordered model defined on a lattice of linear size $L$ with internal dimension $0\leq d&lt;4$ embedded in a medium of dimension $N\gg 1$. The ground-state energy results from a competition between confinement, elasticity and disorder. We obtain an exact description of the large deviation rate function with speed $NL^d$ and its different phases, corresponding to different patterns of replica symmetry breaking (RSB). Our results show that the ground-state energy satisfies a central limit theorem and we obtain an explicit expression for the rescaled variance. In the (massless) limit of zero confinement, this variance vanishes for short-range disorder and the ground-state energy displays super-concentration. From our results on the large deviation function, we characterise explicitly the left tail of the distribution of the typical fluctuations of the ground state energy. It displays an exponential tail for a one step RSB pattern while for a full RSB pattern it decays super-exponentially with a non trivial exponent $\xi$ that we compute explicitly.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic framework for the thermal conductivity of dense fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermodynamic framework that predicts the thermal conductivity $\lambda$ of simple fluids beyond the dilute-gas limit is introduced. By generalizing the transition-rate approach of particles on a lattice to conserved quantities in continuous space, an expression for the ratio $\lambda/\lambda_{\rm id}$, with $\lambda_{\rm id}$ the dilute-gas-limit value, is derived; it depends solely on equilibrium thermodynamic properties and is therefore directly computable from any equation of state. The resulting formula quantitatively reproduces molecular-dynamics data for hard spheres throughout almost the entire fluid range, and captures the behavior of Lennard-Jones fluids in the supercritical region where thermodynamic fluctuations remain moderate. Comparison with experimental data for argon, reported by other authors, also shows very good agreement. These results provide evidence that transport coefficients of dense fluids can be expressed as their dilute-gas values multiplied by a universal thermodynamic factor.</description>

      <title>Refinements of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis under Local Rotational Invariance via Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) was developed as a framework for understanding how the principles of statistical mechanics emerge in the long-time limit of isolated quantum many-body systems. Since then, ETH has shifted the attention towards the study of matrix elements of physical observables in the energy eigenbasis. In this work, we revisit recent developments leading to the formulation of full ETH, a generalization of the original ETH ansatz that accounts for multi-point correlation functions. Using tools from free probability, we explore the implications of local rotational invariance, a property that emerges from the statistical invariance of observables under random basis transformations induced by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to make quantitative predictions and derive an analytical characterization of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, thereby refining the ETH ansatz. Moreover, our analysis links the statistical properties of matrix elements under random basis changes to the empirical averages over energy windows that are usually considered when dealing with a single instance of the ensemble. We validate our analytical predictions through comparison with numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper argues that dataset structure is important in image recognition tasks (among other tasks). Specifically, we focus on the nature and genesis of correlational structure in the actual datasets upon which DNNs are trained. We argue that DNNs are implementing a widespread methodology in condensed matter physics and materials science that focuses on mesoscale correlation structures that live between fundamental atomic/molecular scales and continuum scales. Specifically, we argue that DNNs that are successful in image classification must be discovering high order correlation functions. It is well-known that DNNs successfully generalize in apparent contravention of standard statistical learning theory. We consider the implications of our discussion for this puzzle.</description>

      <title>Obstruction to Ergodicity from Locality and $U(1)$ Higher Symmetries on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the presence of \emph{any} exact $U(1)$ higher-form symmetry, under mild assumptions, presents a fundamental obstruction to ergodicity under unitary dynamics in lattice systems with local interactions and finite on-site Hilbert space dimension. Focusing on the two-dimensional case, we show that such systems necessarily exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation and explicitly construct Krylov sectors whose number scales exponentially with system size. While these sectors cannot be distinguished by symmetry quantum numbers, we identify the emergent integrals of motion which characterize them. Our symmetry-based approach is insensitive to details of the Hamiltonian and the lattice, providing a systematic explanation for ergodicity-breaking in a range of systems, including quantum link models.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Global Measures of Network Centralization: Axiomatic and Numerical Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network centralization, driven by hub nodes, impacts communication efficiency, structural integration, and dynamic processes such as diffusion and synchronization. Although numerous centralization measures exist, a major challenge lies in determining measures that are both theoretically sound and empirically reliable across different network contexts. To resolve this challenge, we normalize 11 measures of network centralization and assess them systematically using an axiomatic framework and numerical simulations. Our axiomatic assessment tests each measure against the six postulates of centralization, ensuring consistency with minimal theoretical requirements. In addition, our numerical assessment examines the behavior of normalized centralization measures over different random graphs. Our results indicate major differences among the measures, despite their common aim of quantifying centralization. Together, our assessments point to the relative suitability of three measures: normalized betweenness centralization, normalized closeness centralization, and normalized degree centralization. Applying these three measures to real-world networks from diverse domains reveals meaningful variation in the organization of the networks with respect to hubs. Normalized betweenness centralization highlights path-based dominance; normalized closeness centralization reflects accessibility and efficiency of reach; and normalized degree centralization captures degree-based hub concentration. When used jointly, the three measures demonstrate the required sensitivity to varying levels of centralization and provide complementary aspects of network centralization that no single measure can offer alone. Our dual evaluation framework clarifies conceptual differences among existing measures and offers practical guidance for selecting reliable centralization metrics.</description>

      <title>Sunburst quantum Ising battery under periodic delta-kick charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most quantum batteries studied so far with notable exception of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) batteries are based on integrable models, where superlinear scaling of charging power and hence a quantum advantage can be achieved, but at the cost of unstable stored energy due to integrability. Here, by considering the sunburst quantum Ising battery driven by periodic delta-kicks, we show that in the quantum chaotic regime a quantum advantage is achieved for number of batteries $n_b\leq 4$, together with excellent stability of energy storage. In the integrable regime optimal energy storage and extraction are possible irrespective of the initial state of the charger. Finally, we show that the observed advantage does not originate from multipartite entanglement within the battery subsystem and is therefore classical in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present stochastic variants of the exponential time differencing schemes for stiff stochastic differential equations. We derive three explicit schemes that offer better stability compared to Euler-Maruyama and Milstein's method, and achieve strong convergence up to order O(h) in the time step h. We combine these schemes with a pseudo-spectral approach to outline efficient algorithms for simulating stochastic field theories with additive noise. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we study several systems in and out of equilibrium, including Model A, Model B, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We outline procedures for computing physical observables such as the critical exponents, correlation functions, and dynamic linear response, and provide our implementation as open source code.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Time-Order Correlator Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) are central probes of quantum scrambling, and their generalizations have recently become key primitives for both benchmarking quantum advantage and learning the structure of Hamiltonians. Yet their behavior has lacked a unified algorithmic interpretation. We show that higher-order OTOCs naturally fit within the framework of quantum signal processing (QSP): each $\mathrm{OTOC}^{(k)}$ measures the $2k$-th Fourier component of the phase distribution associated with the singular values of a spatially resolved truncated propagator. This explains the contrasting sensitivities of time-ordered correlators (TOCs) and higher-order OTOCs to causal-cone structure and to chaotic, integrable, or localized dynamics. Based on this understanding, we further generalize higher-order OTOCs by polynomial transformation of the singular values of the spatially resolved truncated propagator. The resultant signal allows us to construct frequency-selective filters, which we call \emph{OTOC spectroscopy}. This extends conventional OTOCs into a mode-resolved tool for probing scrambling and spectral structure of quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Low-Pass Filtering of Active Turbulent Flows to Liquid Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study the impact of active systems on their surroundings, we introduce a model that couples an active nematic fluid to an isotropic substrate fluid via friction. We numerically show that as the active layer develops turbulence, the substrate inherits the chaotic behaviour, exhibiting a novel form of turbulence driven by locally generated stochastic forcing from the active layer. In particular, the short-length-scale flow structures in the active layer are filtered out, so the system behaves as a de facto low-pass filter. We derive analytically the transfer function between the two layers and use it to predict the large-q decay of the substrate energy spectrum, and to investigate how tensorial quantities, such as the strain rate and the active stresses, are transmitted between the active layer and the substrate. Our analysis agrees with recent experiments measuring velocity-velocity correlations in mixtures of active and passive microtubules, and it may have implications for traction force microscopy measurements in cellular layers.</description>

      <title>Inferring Surface Slip in Active Colloids from Flow Fields Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directed motion of active colloids is governed by spatial variations in surface chemistry and interfacial stress, yet these properties remain extremely difficult to measure directly. We introduce a physics-informed neural network framework that infers the slip distribution driving propulsion from partial observations of the surrounding flow. By combining sparse fluid velocity measurements with the Stokes equations and boundary constraints, the method reconstructs both the near-surface slip and the full velocity and pressure fields. Validation against analytical solutions and Boundary Element Method calculations for canonical active colloid models shows quantitative agreement in both unbounded and confined geometries. Crucially, the framework recovers the surface slip even when no flow data are available near the particle, demonstrating that accessible bulk measurements encode the interfacial stresses responsible for active motion. These results establish physics-informed inference as a powerful tool for characterizing and ultimately controlling interfacially driven transport in colloidal active matter.</description>

      <title>A Functional Field Theorem: An Explicit Proof of Axioms and Equations for Applying iSAFT in Polymer Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work establishes the mathematical equivalence between polymer Self Consistent Field Theory and interfacial SAFT based classical Density Functional Theory by providing an explicit proof that SCFT is the mean field (MF) or saddle point limit of a Legendre dual formulation of iSAFT CDFT. The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems.</description>

      <title>Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact renormalisation scheme for fermionic cellular automata on hypercubic lattices. By grouping neighbouring cells into tiles and selecting subspaces within them, multiple evolution steps on the original system correspond to a single step of an effective automaton acting on the subspaces. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalisability and fully characterise the renormalisation flow for two-cell tiles and two time steps of nearest-neighbour fermionic automata on a chain of spinless modes, identifying all fixed points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of catalytically active droplets in multi-component conserved mixtures affected by noise. Working in the thin interface limit, we analytically determine the state diagram of the system, characterized by multiple dynamical regimes, and verify our findings using numerical simulations. In particular, we show the emergence of a non-reciprocal, chemically-mediated interaction between the droplets, which leads to the formation of (meta-)stable clusters of droplets of different species. We find that the clusters can display self-propulsion in a large part of the parameter space, including regions where the non-reciprocal interactions between the droplets are purely attractive. This surprising feature arises from the non-local nature of the chemical interactions, and points to locality violations as a general mechanism for energy dissipation and emergence of out-of-equilibrium steady states in active matter.</description>

      <title>Extended regime of nematic order in an interacting monomer-dimer model of Heilmann and Lieb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a two-dimensional model of liquid crystals introduced by Heilmann and Lieb (1979), which consists of a system of dimers on the square lattice at chemical potential $\lambda$, interacting via a hard-core repulsion and an attractive interaction of strength $-a&lt;0$ between adjacent, colinear dimers. The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\lambda+a&gt;0$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture under the additional condition that $a&gt;\lambda/3$, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order. To deal with the non-nearest neighbor interactions in the model, we also introduce an extension of the chessboard estimate applicable to finite products of periodic Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the Markovian approximation in the harmonic oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a central ingredient in the construction of quantum dynamics of Brownian motion which necessarily is non-Markovian. Yet, often Markovian approximations to quantum dynamics are studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate the limitations of the Markovian approximation within two paradigmatic models describing a single damped harmonic oscillator. These models are governed by distinct quantum Langevin equations, although both are constructed to satisfy the same set of phenomenological criteria: the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum, the Kubo response relation, the virial theorem, and the equilibrium quantum variance. The limitations of the Markovian approximation are underscored by the classical limit, violations of the Ehrenfest theorem, the breakdown of complete and simple positivity in the reconstructed master equations, and anomalies in thermalisation behaviour. Further phenomenological differences between the two models are illustrated through their quantum relaxation dynamics and phase diagrams, derived from their reinterpretation as mean-field approximations of a many-body interacting magnet. Our analysis explicitly reveals intrinsic inconsistencies introduced by the Markovian approximation, emphasising the need for non-Markovian frameworks for a consistent description of open quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation sets the universality class for growing and roughening of nonequilibrium surfaces without any conservation law and nonlocal effects. We argue here that the KPZ equation can be generalized by including a symmetry-permitted nonlocal nonlinear term of active origin that is of the same order as the one included in the KPZ equation. Including this term, the 2D active KPZ equation is stable in some parameter regimes, in which the interface conformation fluctuations exhibit sublogarithmic or superlogarithmic roughness, with nonuniversal exponents, giving positional generalised quasi-long-ranged order. For other parameter choices, the model is unstable, suggesting a perturbatively inaccessible algebraically rough interface or positional short-ranged order. Our model should serve as a paradigmatic nonlocal growth equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamic theory of anisotropic and inversion-asymmetric moving active permeable fluid membranes. These are described by an anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. Depending upon the anisotropy parameters, the membrane is either effectively isotropic and algebraically rough with translational short, but orientational long range order, or unstable, suggestive of membrane crumpling.</description>

      <title>Diffusion in a wedge geometry: First-Passage Statistics under Stochastic Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diffusion process in the presence of stochastic resetting inside a two-dimensional wedge of top angle $\alpha$, bounded by two infinite absorbing edges. In the absence of resetting, the second moment of the first-passage time diverges for $\alpha&gt;\pi/4$ while it remains finite for $\alpha&lt;\pi/4$, resulting in an unbounded or bounded coefficient of variation in the respective angular regimes. Upon introducing stochastic resetting, we analyze the first-passage properties in both cases and identify the geometric configurations in which resetting consistently enhances the rate of absorption or escape through the boundaries. By deriving the expressions for the probability currents and conditional first-passage quantities such as splitting probabilities and conditional mean first-passage times, we demonstrate how resetting can be employed to bias the escape pathway through the favorable boundary. Our theoretical predictions are verified through Langevin-type numerical simulations, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Load-Dependent Power-Law Exponent in Creep Rupture of Heterogeneous Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creep tests on heterogeneous materials under subcritical loading typically show a power-law decaying strain rate before failure, with the exponent often considered material-dependent but independent of applied stress. By imposing successive small stress relaxations through a displacement feedback loop, we probe creep dynamics and show experimentally that this exponent varies with both applied load and loading direction. Simulations of a disordered fiber bundle model reproduce this load dependence, demonstrating that such models capture essential features of delayed rupture dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility of the pendulum revisited from Husimi's adiabaticity parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the irreversibility of the pendulum with time-dependent angular frequency, considered in a classical paper by K. Husimi. He introduced a parameter that measures the adiabaticity of a process utilizing an adiabatic invariant for the equation of motion of the pendulum. With this adiabaticity parameter, Husimi showed the irreversibility of the pendulum for a cyclic process, which is reminiscent of the Planck principle in thermodynamics, based on the microscopic mechanics. In this study, we generalize the argument by Husimi to a damped pendulum with friction, and highlight the role of conservation of a phase-space area on the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter. Moreover, we also investigate the second law of thermodynamics and its generalization for a general non-cyclic process as well as a cyclic process, and elucidate how the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter impacts on this law. In particular, for a general non-cyclic process, we show the law of entropy non-decrease for the pendulum without friction by using the property of the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter.</description>

      <title>Kinetic description of one-dimensional stochastic dynamics with small inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a small finite inertia.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the critical properties of a weakly diluted (random) Ising model with the long-range interaction decaying with distance $x$ as $\sim x^{-d-\sigma}$ in a $d$-dimensional space. It is known to belong to a new long-range random universality class for certain values of the decay parameter $\sigma$. Exploiting the field-theoretic renormalization group approach within the minimal subtraction scheme, we compute the three-loop rermalization group functions. On their basis, with the help of asymptotic series resummation methods, we estimate the correlation length critical exponent $\nu$ characterising the new universality class for $d=3$ and for those values of $\sigma$ for which long-range interactions are relevant for the critical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Simulated Annealing for Quadratic and Higher-Order Unconstrained Integer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulated annealing (SA) is a key algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems, which model numerous real-world systems. While SA is commonly used to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, many practical problems are more naturally formulated using integer variables. We therefore study quadratic and higher-order unconstrained integer optimization (QUIO and HUIO) problems, which generalize QUBO by allowing integer-valued variables and higher-order interactions. Conventional approaches often convert these problems into QUBO formulations through binary encoding and the reduction of higher-order terms. Such conversions, however, greatly increase the number of variables and interactions, resulting in long computation times and, for large-scale problems, even making the conversion itself a dominant computational bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient framework that directly applies SA to QUIO and HUIO problems without converting them into QUBO. Within this framework, we introduce an optimal-transition Metropolis method, designed to improve efficiency when the variable range is wide, and evaluate its performance alongside the conventional Metropolis and heat bath methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed direct approach achieves higher efficiency and better solution quality than the conventional QUBO-based formulation and reveal the practical advantages of the optimal-transition Metropolis method. The algorithm developed in this study is available as part of the open-source library OpenJij, which provides a Python front end with a C++ backend.</description>

      <title>From Static Pathways to Dynamic Mechanisms: A Committor-Based Data-Driven Approach to Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As computational chemistry methods evolve, dynamic effects have been increasingly recognized to govern chemical reaction pathways in both organic and inorganic systems. Here, we introduce a committor-based workflow that integrates a path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) with an iteratively trained hybrid-DFT-level message passing atomic convolutional encoder (MACE) potential. Beginning with a static nudged elastic band path, PCCANN extracts a committor-consistent string to represent the reactive ensemble. We illustrate the power of this methodology through two representative applications. First, we investigate an SNAr reaction using MACE trained at hybrid DFT level with implicit solvent. The mechanism is found to be concerted, and the dynamic approach reveals a lower barrier than static treatments. Second, we apply the same protocol to the isomerization of protonated isobutanol to protonated 2-butanol, yielding a quantitatively accurate free-energy landscape. We uncover three competing channels: the established concerted mechanism and two asynchronous stepwise routes mediated by water and methyl transfer, all with comparable activation barriers. Notably, the stepwise pathways traverse metastable intermediates that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been described in prior mechanistic studies. Calculated barrier heights and intermediate stabilities are in close agreement with high-level DFT benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's accuracy. Together, these studies highlight mechanistic diversity across distinct systems and establish the synergistic PCCANN-MACE protocol as a proof-of-concept approach for committor-based discovery of complex reaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Universality in Neural Network Dynamics with Generalized Structured Input Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00642v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing neural network dynamics via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is crucial to building theoretical foundations for deep learning. Previous work has analyzed structured inputs within the \textit{hidden manifold model}, often under the simplifying assumption of a Gaussian distribution. We extend this framework by modeling inputs as Gaussian mixtures to better represent complex, real-world data. Through empirical and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that with proper standardization, the learning dynamics converges to the behavior seen in the simple Gaussian case. This finding exhibits a form of universality, where diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, thereby strengthening the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous nucleation for two-dimensional Kawasaki dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the third in a series of three papers in which we study a lattice gas subject to Kawasaki dynamics at inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ in a large finite box $\Lambda_\beta \subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ whose volume depends on $\beta$. Each pair of neighbouring particles has a negative binding energy $-U&lt;0$, while each particle has a positive activation energy $\Delta&gt;0$. The initial configuration is drawn from the grand-canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is to describe, in the metastable regime $\Delta \in (U,2U)$ and in the limit as $\beta\to\infty$, how and when the system nucleates, i.e., creates a critical droplet somewhere in $\Lambda_\beta$ that subsequently grows by absorbing particles from the surrounding gas.
  In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the second paper we used the results in the first paper to analyse how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when the volume is moderately large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\theta\beta}$ with $\Delta &lt; \theta &lt; 2\Delta-U$. In the present paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta| = \mathrm{e}^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Theta &lt; \Gamma-(2\Delta-U)$, where $\Gamma$ is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time and the tube of typical trajectories towards nucleation. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation. One of the key ingredients in the proof is an estimate showing that no information can travel between these boxes on relevant time scales.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and Mpemba-like patterns in effective temperature dynamics of strongly coupled dissipative quantum chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous thermalization, particularly the crossings of temperature trajectories from different initial states termed Mpemba crossings (MPCs), have intrigued scientists for decades. While recent studies in quantum systems suggest that initial conditions play a decisive role in its emergence, they offer limited insight into MPCs in complex, highly nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we investigate temperature dynamics in the strongly coupled, quantum chaotic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which is dual to the low-energy dynamics of 2D dilaton gravity. Our findings reveal a dynamically driven nonequilibrium mechanism underlying MPCs during rapid thermalization, with implications for gravitational systems. We explore quench dynamics in SYK systems under three conditions: coupling to a single SYK thermal bath, coupling to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. We find that strong system-bath coupling induces oscillating effective temperatures and trajectory crossings in transient states due to nonequilibrium statistics, phenomena absent in quasi-static thermodynamics and Lindbladian SYKs. These MPCs highlight a unique feature of anomalous thermalization of strongly coupled quantum chaotic systems driven far from equilibrium. Besides, the results also provide qualitative insights into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of black holes strongly interacting with their environment, such as primordial black holes in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic framework for Floquet prethermalization under strong resonant driving, emphasizing the pivotal role of dynamical space-time symmetries. Our approach demonstrates how dynamical space-time symmetries map onto the projective static symmetry group of the prethermal Hamiltonian governing the prethermal regime. We introduce techniques for detecting dynamical symmetries through the time evolution of local observables, facilitating a detailed analysis of micromotion within each period and surpassing the limitations of conventional stroboscopic Floquet prethermal dynamics. To implement this framework, we present a prethermal protocol that preserves order-two dynamical symmetry in a spin-ladder model, confirming the predicted relationships between the expectation values of local observables at distinct temporal points in the Floquet cycle, linked by this symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We consider initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs) on a finite interval for the system of the energy balance equation and Guyer-Krumhansl constitutive equation. Boundary conditions comprise various models of behavior of a physical system at the boundaries, including boundary conditions describing Newton's law, which states that the heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method. To illustrate the final formulae, we consider a numerical example for a special case in which heat exchange at one of the boundaries obeys Newton's law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-boson model's dynamical and thermodynamic features in the weak coupling regime using the weak coupling spin-boson (WCSB) and phase covariant (PC) master equations. Both unital (pure dephasing) and non-unital (dissipative) quantum channels are considered. On the dynamical side, we explore key quantum features including non-Markovianity, quantum speed limit, quantum coherence, and the system's steady-state behavior. Notably, the measures of non-Markovianity exhibit different behavior under WCSB and PC dynamics. From the quantum thermodynamic perspective, we conceptualize the spin-boson system as a quantum battery and analyze its performance through metrics such as energy, ergotropy, anti-ergotropy, and battery capacity. We further examine the roles of pure dephasing and dissipative processes in shaping the battery's performance. Our findings demonstrate the spin-boson model's versatility as a platform for efficient energy storage and transfer in quantum thermodynamic devices.</description>

Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum transport on a ring via locally monitored chiral quantum walks</title>

Abstract: In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk. Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport in monitored systems.</description>

      <title>Collective communication in a transparent world: Phase transitions in a many-body Potts model and social-quantum duality</title>

Abstract: Digitally connected societies approach a \enquote{transparent} regime where all agents can interact without geographic or social barriers -- a limit realized by complete graph topologies. We solve exactly a $q$-state Potts model with many-body interactions on this geometry, modeling agents from $q$ distinct communities. Analyzing the illustrative case of competing pairwise and three-body couplings, we identify three key phases in the thermodynamic limit: democratic (all communities equal), marginalized ($q-1$ communities surviving), and consensus (one dominant group). For two-community systems, we identify a special coupling regime where interaction energies cancel, yielding purely entropy-driven dynamics -- a statistical physics representation of atomized societies without structured influence. Monte Carlo simulations confirm these phases and reveal metastable switching dynamics in finite systems. Furthermore, we establish an exact correspondence between this social model and mean-field $SU(N)$ quantum spin systems with quadratic and cubic Casimir interactions, revealing a \enquote{social-quantum} duality. This duality enables quantitative classification of social structures via Young diagrams and reinterprets quantum symmetry breaking as opinion stratification, bridging statistical sociology and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Introduction to modelling radical pair quantum spin dynamics with tensor networks</title>

Abstract: Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity and Mixed-State Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a unified framework connecting decoherence and quantum complexity. By vectorizing the density matrix into a pure state in a double Hilbert space, a decoherence process is mapped to an imaginary-time evolution. Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</description>

      <title>Temporal entanglement transition in chaotic quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law) scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms accurately describes local evolution.</description>

      <title>Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the Ising model on random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study phase transitions in the Ising model on random graphs using graph limits. We show that the critical temperatures are determined by the eigenvalues of the kernel operator associated with the graph limit. Bifurcation diagrams for Erdos-Renyi, small-world, and power-law graphs illustrate the theory. In the small-world case, we identify metastable behavior in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes.</description>
