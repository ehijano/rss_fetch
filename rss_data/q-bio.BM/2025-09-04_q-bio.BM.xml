      <title>SurGBSA: Learning Representations From Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining from static structures of drug-like compounds and proteins enable powerful learned feature representations. Learned features demonstrate state of the art performance on a range of predictive tasks including molecular properties, structure generation, and protein-ligand interactions. The majority of approaches are limited by their use of static structures and it remains an open question, how best to use atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to develop more generalized models to improve prediction accuracy for novel molecular structures. We present SURrogate mmGBSA (SurGBSA) as a new modeling approach for MD-based representation learning, which learns a surrogate function of the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA). We show for the first time the benefits of physics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection of over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the CASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 6,497x speedup versus a traditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching single-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for identification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances the development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements when training on MD simulations. Models, code and training data are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>SafeProtein: Red-Teaming Framework and Benchmark for Protein Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.</description>
