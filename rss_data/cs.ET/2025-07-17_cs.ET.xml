      <title>Emerging Paradigms in the Energy Sector: Forecasting and System Control Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy sector is experiencing rapid transformation due to increasing renewable energy integration, decentralisation of power systems, and a heightened focus on efficiency and sustainability. With energy demand becoming increasingly dynamic and generation sources more variable, advanced forecasting and optimisation strategies are crucial for maintaining grid stability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. This paper explores emerging paradigms in energy forecasting and management, emphasizing four critical domains: Energy Demand Forecasting integrated with Weather Data, Building Energy Optimisation, Heat Network Optimisation, and Energy Management System (EMS) Optimisation within a System of Systems (SoS) framework. Leveraging machine learning techniques and Model Predictive Control (MPC), the study demonstrates substantial enhancements in energy efficiency across scales -- from individual buildings to complex interconnected energy networks. Weather-informed demand forecasting significantly improves grid resilience and resource allocation strategies. Smart building optimisation integrates predictive analytics to substantially reduce energy consumption without compromising occupant comfort. Optimising CHP-based heat networks achieves cost and carbon savings while adhering to operational and asset constraints. At the systems level, sophisticated EMS optimisation ensures coordinated control of distributed resources, storage solutions, and demand-side flexibility. Through real-world case studies we highlight the potential of AI-driven automation and integrated control solutions in facilitating a resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy future.</description>

      <title>The AI Shadow War: SaaS vs. Edge Computing Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very DNA of AI architecture presents conflicting paths: centralized cloud-based models (Software-as-a-Service) versus decentralized edge AI (local processing on consumer devices). This paper analyzes the competitive battleground across computational capability, energy efficiency, and data privacy. Recent breakthroughs show edge AI challenging cloud systems on performance, leveraging innovations like test-time training and mixture-of-experts architectures. Crucially, edge AI boasts a 10,000x efficiency advantage: modern ARM processors consume merely 100 microwatts forinference versus 1 watt for equivalent cloud processing. Beyond efficiency, edge AI secures data sovereignty by keeping processing local, dismantling single points of failure in centralized architectures. This democratizes access throughaffordable hardware, enables offline functionality, and reduces environmental impact by eliminating data transmission costs. The edge AI market projects explosive growth from $9 billion in 2025 to $49.6 billion by 2030 (38.5% CAGR), fueled by privacy demands and real-time analytics. Critical applications including personalized education, healthcare monitoring, autonomous transport, and smart infrastructure rely on edge AI's ultra-low latency (5-10ms versus 100-500ms for cloud). The convergence of architectural innovation with fundamental physics confirms edge AI's distributed approach aligns with efficient information processing, signaling the inevitable emergence of hybrid edge-cloud ecosystems.</description>

      <title>GIST: Group Interaction Sensing Toolkit for Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how teams coordinate, share work, and negotiate roles in immersive environments is critical for designing effective mixed-reality (MR) applications that support real-time collaboration. However, existing methods either rely on external cameras and offline annotation or focus narrowly on single modalities, limiting their validity and applicability. To address this, we present a novel group interaction sensing toolkit (GIST), a deployable system that passively captures multi-modal interaction data, such as speech, gaze, and spatial proximity from commodity MR headset's sensors and automatically derives both overall static interaction networks and dynamic moment-by-moment behavior patterns. We evaluate GIST with a human subject study with 48 participants across 12 four-person groups performing an open-ended image-sorting task in MR. Our analysis shows strong alignment between the identified behavior modes and shifts in interaction network structure, confirming that momentary changes in speech, gaze, and proximity data are observable through the sensor data.</description>

      <title>Generative Intelligence Systems in the Flow of Group Emotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotional cues frequently arise and shape group dynamics in interactive settings where multiple humans and artificial agents communicate through shared digital channels. While artificial agents lack intrinsic emotional states, they can simulate affective behavior using synthetic modalities such as text or speech. This work introduces a model for orchestrating emotion contagion, enabling agents to detect emotional signals, infer group mood patterns, and generate targeted emotional responses. The system captures human emotional exchanges and uses this insight to produce adaptive, generative responses that influence group affect in real time. The model supports applications in collaborative, educational, and social environments by shifting affective computing from individual-level reactions to coordinated, group-level emotion modulation. We present the system architecture and provide experimental results that illustrate its effectiveness in sensing and steering group mood dynamics.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Tree-based Machine Learning by $MoS_2$ Flash-based Analog CAM with Inherent Soft Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised concerns regarding its trustworthiness, especially in terms of interpretability and robustness. Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost excel in interpretability and accuracy for tabular data, but scaling them remains computationally expensive due to poor data locality and high data dependence. Previous efforts to accelerate these models with analog content addressable memory (CAM) have struggled, due to the fact that the difficult-to-implement sharp decision boundaries are highly susceptible to device variations, which leads to poor hardware performance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This work presents a novel hardware-software co-design approach using $MoS_2$ Flash-based analog CAM with inherent soft boundaries, enabling efficient inference with soft tree-based models. Our soft tree model inference experiments on $MoS_2$ analog CAM arrays show this method achieves exceptional robustness against device variation and adversarial attacks while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, our fabricated analog CAM arrays achieve $96\%$ accuracy on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database, while maintaining decision explainability. Our experimentally calibrated model validated only a $0.6\%$ accuracy drop on the MNIST dataset under $10\%$ device threshold variation, compared to a $45.3\%$ drop for traditional decision trees. This work paves the way for specialized hardware that enhances AI's trustworthiness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time Solver of Tridiagonal QUBO, QUDO and Tensor QUDO problems with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10509v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum-inspired tensor network algorithm for solving tridiagonal Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems and quadratic unconstrained discrete optimization (QUDO) problems. We also solve the more general Tensor quadratic unconstrained discrete optimization (T-QUDO) problems with one-neighbor interactions in a lineal chain. This method provides an exact and explicit equation for these problems. Our algorithms are based on the simulation of a state that undergoes imaginary time evolution and a Half partial trace. In addition, we address the degenerate case and evaluate the polynomial complexity of the algorithm, also providing a parallelized version. We implemented and tested them with other well-known classical algorithms and observed an improvement in the quality of the results. The performance of the proposed algorithms is compared with the Google OR-TOOLS and dimod solvers, improving their results.</description>

      <title>"Is it always watching? Is it always listening?" Exploring Contextual Privacy and Security Concerns Toward Domestic Social Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities, social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices. However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19 semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and context-appropriate functionality.</description>
