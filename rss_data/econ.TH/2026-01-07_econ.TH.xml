      <title>Improving Financial Forecasting with a Synergistic LLM-Transformer Architecture: A Hybrid Approach to Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) with a Transformer architecture for stock price forecasting. The research addresses a critical theoretical gap in existing approaches that empirically combine textual and numerical data without a formal understanding of their interaction mechanisms. We conceptualise a prompt-based LLM as a mathematically defined signal generator, capable of extracting directional market sentiment and an associated confidence score from financial news. These signals are then dynamically fused with structured historical price features through a noise-robust gating mechanism, enabling the Transformer to adaptively weigh semantic and quantitative information. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid LLM-Transformer model significantly outperforms a Vanilla Transformer baseline, reducing the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 5.28% (p = 0.003). Moreover, ablation and robustness analyses confirm the model's stability under noisy conditions and its capacity to maintain interpretability through confidence-weighted attention. The findings provide both theoretical and empirical support for a paradigm shift from empirical observation to formalised modelling of LLM-Transformer interactions, paving the way toward explainable, noise-resilient, and semantically enriched financial forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>Constant-Factor Algorithms for Revenue Management with Consecutive Stays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study network revenue management problems motivated by applications such as railway ticket sales and hotel room bookings. Requests, each requiring a resource for a consecutive stay, arrive sequentially with known arrival probabilities. We investigate two scenarios: the accept-or-reject scenario, where a request can be fulfilled by assigning any available resource; and the BAM-based scenario, which generalizes the former by incorporating customer preferences through the basic attraction model (BAM), allowing the platform to offer an assortment of available resources from which the customer may choose. We develop polynomial-time policies and evaluate their performance using approximation ratios, defined as the ratio between the expected revenue of our policy and that of the optimal online algorithm. When each arrival has a fixed request type (e.g., the interval of the stay is fixed), we establish constant-factor guarantees: a ratio of 1 - 1/e for the accept-or-reject scenario and 0.25 for the BAM-based scenario. We further extend these results to the case where the request type is random (e.g., the interval of the stay is random). In this setting, the approximation ratios incur an additional multiplicative factor of 1 - 1/e, resulting in guarantees of at least 0.399 for the accept-or-reject scenario and 0.156 for the BAM-based scenario. These constant-factor guarantees stand in sharp contrast to the prior nonconstant competitive ratios that are benchmarked against the offline optimum.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Knowledge Transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimal design of relational contracts that incentivize an expert to share specialized knowledge with a novice. While the expert fears that a more knowledgeable novice may later erode his future rents, a third-party principal is willing to allocate her resources to facilitate knowledge transfer. In the unique profit-maximizing contract between the principal and the expert, the expert is asked to train the novice as much as possible, for free, in the initial period; knowledge transfers then proceed gradually and perpetually, while the principal offers lump-sum compensations to the expert right after verifying each transfer; even in the long run, a complete knowledge transfer might not be attainable. Our analysis sheds light on the success of several prominent cross-border technology transfers that took place in China's auto industry and Korea's high-speed rail development.</description>

      <title>It's Not All Black and White: Degree of Truthfulness for Risk-Avoiding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classic notion of \emph{truthfulness} requires that no agent has a profitable manipulation -- an untruthful report that, for \emph{some} combination of reports of the other agents, increases her utility. This strong notion implicitly assumes that the manipulating agent either knows what all other agents are going to report, or is willing to take the risk and act as-if she knows their reports.
  Without knowledge of the others' reports, most manipulations are \emph{risky} -- they might decrease the manipulator's utility for some other combinations of reports by the other agents. Accordingly, a recent paper (Bu, Song and Tao, ``On the existence of truthful fair cake cutting mechanisms'', Artificial Intelligence 319 (2023), 103904) suggests a relaxed notion, which we refer to as \emph{risk-avoiding truthfulness (RAT)}, which requires only that no agent can gain from a \emph{safe} manipulation -- one that is sometimes beneficial and never harmful.
  Truthfulness and RAT are two extremes: the former considers manipulators with complete knowledge of others, whereas the latter considers manipulators with no knowledge at all. In reality, agents often know about some -- but not all -- of the other agents. This paper introduces the \emph{RAT-degree} of a mechanism, defined as the smallest number of agents whose reports, if known, may allow another agent to safely manipulate, or $n$ if there is no such number. This notion interpolates between classic truthfulness (degree $n$) and RAT (degree at least $1$): a mechanism with a higher RAT-degree is harder to manipulate safely.
  To illustrate the generality and applicability of this concept, we analyze the RAT-degree of prominent mechanisms across various social choice settings, including auctions, indivisible goods allocations, cake-cutting, voting, and two-sided matching.</description>
