      <title>Star and weak star irreducible fully commutative elements in Coxeter groups of affine types $\widetilde{B}$ and $\widetilde{D}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star operation, originally introduced by Kazhdan and Lusztig, was later specialized by Ernst to the so-called weak star reduction on the set of fully commutative elements of a Coxeter group. In this paper, we classify the star and weak star irreducible fully commutative elements in Coxeter groups of affine types $\widetilde{B}_{n+1}$ and $\widetilde{D}_{n+2}$. Focusing then on the case of type $\widetilde{D}_{n+2}$, we use the classification of star irreducible elements to provide a new proof of the faithfulness of a diagrammatic representation of the corresponding generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra, along with an explicit description of Lusztig's $\mathbf{a}$-function.</description>

      <title>Volume Polynomials and Log-concavity of the Characteristic Polynomials of Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rota--Heron--Welsh conjecture (now a theorem of Adiprasito, Huh, and the author) asserts the log-concavity of the characteristic polynomial of matroids. We give an exposition of the Lorentzian polynomial proof following the work of Branden and Leake aimed at undergraduate and beginning graduate students.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a physical model of ordered sums of integers as trains of rods. The trains for a fixed, possibly infinite, set of rod lengths naturally correspond to nodes in a tree; relations among finite linear recursions encoded in the subtrees define algebraic operations on sets of rods. We use this algebra to prove classic identities for recursively defined sequences, to show that Lucas sequences are divisibility sequences, to characterize two-term linear Fibonacci identities, and to find the cyclotomic polynomial factors of Borwein trinomials. We complement abstractions with lots of examples.</description>

      <title>A forbidden pair for quasi 5-contractible edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge of a quasi $k$-connected graph is said to be quasi $k$-contractible if the contraction of the edge results in a quasi $k$-connected graph. If every quasi $k$-connected graph without a quasi $k$-contractible edge has either $H_{1}$ or $H_{2}$ as a subgraph, then an unordered pair of graphs $\{H_{1}, H_{2}\}$ is said to be a forbidden pair for quasi $k$-contractible edges. We prove that $\{K_{4}^{-}, \overline{P_{5}}\}$ is a forbidden pair for quasi 5-contractible edges, where $K_{4}^{-}$ is the graph obtained from $K_{4}$ by removing just one edge and $\overline{P_{5}}$ is the complement of a path on five vertices.</description>

      <title>Polynomial extension of Van der Waerden's Theorem near zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a dense subring of the real numbers. In this paper we prove a polynomial version of Van der Waerden's theorem near zero. In fact, we prove that if $p_1,\ldots,p_m \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ are polynomials such that $p_i(0) = 0$ and there exists $\delta &gt; 0$ such that $p_i(x) &gt; 0$ for every $x \in (0,\delta)$ and for every $i=1,\ldots , m$. Then for any finite partition $\mathcal{C}$ of \( S\cap(0,1) \) and every sequence $f:\mathbb{N}\to S\cap(0,1)$ satisfying $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;\infty$, there exist a cell $C \in \mathcal{C}$, an element $a \in S$, and $F \in P_f(\mathbb{N})$ such that
  \[
  \{ a + p_i(\sum_{t \in F} f(t)) : i = 1,2,\ldots,m \} \subseteq C.

      <title>On packing total coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new concept in graph coloring, namely the \textit{packing total coloring}, which extends the idea of packing coloring to both the vertices and the edges of a given graph. More precisely, for a graph $G$, a packing total coloring is a mapping $c: V(G) \cup E(G) \rightarrow \{1, 2, \ldots\}$ with the property that for any integer $i$, any two distinct elements $A, B \in V(G) \cup E(G)$ with $c(A) = c(B) = i$ must be at distance at least $i+1$ from each other. The smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a packing total coloring using $k$ colors is called the \textit{packing total chromatic number}, denoted by $\chi_\rho^{''}(G)$.
  In addition to introducing this new concept, we provide lower and upper bounds for the packing total chromatic numbers of graphs. Furthermore, we consider packing total chromatic numbers of graphs from the perspective of their maximum degrees and characterize all graphs $G$ with $\chi_\rho^{''}(G) \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$.</description>

      <title>Critical edge sets in vertex-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criticality is a fundamental notion in graph theory that has been studied continually since its introduction in the early 50s by Dirac. A graph is called $k$-vertex-critical ($k$-edge-critical) if it is $k$-chromatic but removing any vertex (edge) lowers the chromatic number to $k-1$. A set of edges in a graph is called critical if its removal reduces the chromatic number of the graph.
  In 1970, Dirac conjectured a rather strong distinction between the notions of vertex- and edge-criticality, namely that for every $k\ge 4$ there exists a $k$-vertex-critical graph that does not have any critical edges. This conjecture was proved for $k\ge 5$ by Jensen in 2002 and remains open only for $k=4$. A much stronger version of Dirac's conjecture was proposed by Erd\H{o}s in 1985: Let $k\ge 4$ be fixed, and let $f_k(n)$ denote the largest integer such that there exists a $k$-vertex-critical graph of order $n$ in which no set of at most $f_k(n)$ edges is critical. Is it true that $f_k(n)\rightarrow \infty$ for $n\rightarrow \infty$?
  Strengthening previous partial results, we solve this problem affirmatively for all $k&gt;4$, proving that $$f_k(n)=\Omega(n^{1/3}).$$ This leaves only the case $k=4$ open. We also show that a stronger lower bound of order $\sqrt{n}$ holds along an infinite sequence of numbers $n$. Finally, we provide a first non-trivial upper bound on the functions $f_k$ by proving that $$f_k(n)=O\left(\frac{n}{(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}}\right)$$ for every $k\ge 4$. Our proof of the lower bound on $f_k(n)$ involves an intricate analysis of the structure of proper colorings of a modification of an earlier construction due to Jensen, combined with a gluing operation that creates new vertex-critical graphs without small critical edge sets from given such graphs. The upper bound is obtained using a variant of Szemer\'{e}di's regularity lemma due to Conlon and Fox.</description>

      <title>On g-Extra Connectivity of Corona-Type Graph Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connectivity is one of the central ideas in graph theory, especially when it comes to building fault-tolerant networks. A cutset $S$ of $G$ is defined to be the set of vertices in $G$ whose removal disconnects the graph. An $R_g$ cutset of $G$ is a cutset whose removal disconnects the graph in such a way that each connected component has at least $g+1$ vertices. If $G$ has at least one $R_g$ cutset then the $g-$extra vertex connectivity (or the $g-$extra edge connectivity), denoted as $\kappa_g(G)$ ($\lambda_g(G)$), is defined as the minimum cardinality of $R_g$ cutset. In this paper, we obtain the $g-$ extra connectivity of various corona type graph products edge corona, neighbourhood corona, subdivision vertex neighbourhood corona,subdivision edge neighbourhood corona and generalised corona product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree walks are a class of closed walks on a complete graph constrained to span trees. In this work, we focus on a special subclass called $k$-tours, which were recently introduced by Gunnells and are enumerated by the hypergraph Catalan numbers $ c_n^{(k)}$. Gunnells conjectured an asymptotic formula for $c_n^{(k)}$ which we confirm through an alternative approach to their enumeration. As it turns out, the asymptotic growth is governed by the number of $k$-tours on star-like trees.</description>

Abstract: We show that there exists an absolute positive constant $b (\geq \frac{1}{48})$ so that any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that is $d$-dimensional determines at least $bdn$ lines with pairwise distinct directions. As a consequence we prove that there are $d$-dimensional real norms $\|\cdot\|$ so that every set of $n&gt;n_0(d)$ points that is $d$-dimensional determines at least $(bd-o(1))n$ distinct distances with respect to $\|\cdot \|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09107v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the support of the Grothendieck polynomial $\mathfrak G_w$ of any fireworks permutation is as large as possible: a monomial appears in $\mathfrak G_w$ if and only if it divides $\mathbf x^{\mathrm{wt}(\overline{D(w)})}$ and is divisible by some monomial appearing in the Schubert polynomial $\mathfrak S_w$. Our formula implies that the homogenization of $\mathfrak G_w$ has M-convex support. We also show that for any fireworks permutation $w\in S_n$, there exists a layered permutation $\pi(w)\in S_n$ so that $\mathrm{supp}(\mathfrak G_{\pi(w)})\supseteq \mathrm{supp}(\mathfrak G_w)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sharp endpoint extension inequality for the moment curve in finite fields. We determine the optimal constant and characterize the maximizers in two complementary regimes: (i) low dimensions $d\leq 20$; (ii) large field cardinality $q\geq \frac{d(d-1)}{2 \log 6} + \frac{(2d-1)}{3}$. Our proof strategy relies on an intriguing interplay between analysis, algebra and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Dubrovin-Natanzon divisors on MM-curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ${\mathtt{MM}}$-curves are rational degenerations of ${\mathtt{M}}$-curves, i.e. they are maximal Mumford in the sense that they posses $g$ tropical cycles and exactly $g+1$ real ovals, where $g$ is the arithmetic genus. For rational curves the ``naive'' definition of divisors as formal sums of points requires a refinement. In the finite-gap theory of KP II equation the real regular solutions correspond to the Dubrovin-Natanzon (DN) divisors on ${\mathtt{M}}$-curves. In the case of real regular multiline KP II solitons, it was shown by the authors that for any given solution there exists a normalization time such that the spectral data are smooth DN divisor on ${\mathtt{MM}}$-curve.
  However, to show that DN divisors parameterize the; full positroid cell, it is necessary to fix the normalization time and consider both smooth and non-smooth divisors. In this paper we start such an investigation, and show that on ${\mathtt{MM}}$-curves whose dual graphs are trivalent Le-graphs of totally positive Schubert cells, the construction of non-smooth DN divisors requires combinations of just two basic types of blow-ups.</description>

      <title>On $q$-real and $q$-complex numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:1812.00170, S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko introduced the notion of the $q$-rational number $[x]_q$, $x\in \Bbb Q$, a rational function specializing to $x$ at $q=1$, obtained by $q$-deforming the continued fraction expansion of $x$. In arXiv:1908.04365 they introduced $q$-real numbers $[x]_q$, $x\in \Bbb R$ - a Laurent series in $q$ converging to the rational function $[x]_q$ when $x\in \Bbb Q$. In arXiv:2102.00891 it is proved that if $x\in \Bbb Q_{&gt;1}$ then the series $[x]_q$ converges for $|q|&lt;3-2\sqrt{2}\approx 0.17$ and conjectured that for all $x\in \Bbb R_{&gt;1}$ this series converges in some disk centered in the origin, with the expected common radius of convergence $R_*=\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx 0.38$, achieved when $x=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio. This was proved for rational $x$ in arXiv:2405.15970 using the theory of Kleinian groups. In this paper we (partially) prove this conjecture by showing that for all $x\in \Bbb R_{&gt;1}$, the series $[x]_q$ converges in the disk $|q|&lt;3-2\sqrt{2}$ to a nonvanishing holomorphic function. This is achieved by giving an expansion of $1/[x]_q$ into a $q$-adically convergent series of rational functions converging absolutely and uniformly on compact sets in an explicit region $D$ containing this disk. We also show that this expansion converges to a positive analytic function on the interval $(-\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2},1)$, giving a definition of $[x]_q$ for $q$ from this interval. Moreover, we show that the result of arXiv:2405.15970 implies convergence of $[x]_q$ for $|q|&lt;2-\sqrt{3}\approx 0.27$. We also give examples of explicit computation of $[x]_q$ for transcendental numbers $x$, e.g. $x={\rm cotan}(1)$. Finally, we propose a definition of the $q$-complex number $[\tau]_q$, a meromorphic function of $\tau\in \Bbb C_+$ which expresses via hypergeometric functions of modular functions of $\tau$.</description>

Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem, formulated by Krasner in the 1950's, in the context of Polish (i.e. separable complete) ultrametric spaces by providing a characterization of their isometry groups using suitable forms of generalized wreath products of full permutation groups. Since our solution is developed in the finer context of topological (Polish) groups, it also solves a problem of Gao and Kechris from 2003. Furthermore, we provide an exact correspondence between the isometry groups of Polish ultrametric spaces belonging to some natural subclasses and various kinds of generalized wreath products proposed in the literature by Hall, Holland, and Malicki.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and Dynamical Systems of Dickson Polynomials in Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence \( [D_n(x, \alpha) \mod (x^q - x)]_n \), where \( D_n(x, \alpha) \) denotes a Dickson polynomial of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo \( x^q - x \). We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences, particularly in the case when \( n \) is coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). In addition, we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree \( n \) is not coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). Our results offer deep insights into the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical systems over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Optimum 1-Step Majority-Logic Decoding of Binary Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical majority-logic decoder proposed by Reed for Reed-Muller codes RM(r, m) of order r and length 2^m, unfolds in r+1 sequential steps, decoding message symbols from highest to lowest degree. Several follow-up decoding algorithms reduced the number of steps, but for a limited set of parameters, or at the expense of reduced performance, or relying on the existence of some combinatorial structures. We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that is, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without sequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r and m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance. We then introduce a new hard-decision decoder that completes the decoding in a single step and attains this error-correction limit. It applies to all r and m, and can be viewed as a parallel realization of Reed's original algorithm, decoding all message symbols simultaneously. Remarkably, we also prove that the decoder is optimum in the erasure setting: it recovers the message from any erasure pattern of up to d_min-1 symbols-the theoretical limit. To our knowledge, this is the first 1-step decoder for RM codes that achieves both optimal erasure correction and the maximum one-step error correction capability.</description>

      <title>The fluctuations of the mod p rank of triangular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random lower triangular matrices such that the entries on and below the diagonal are i.i.d. copies of some $\mathbb{Z}$-valued random variable. We prove that the Sylow $p$-subgroups of the cokernels of these matrices have the same constant order fluctuations as that of the matrix products studied by Nguyen and Van Peski.
  As a special case, we can describe the limiting fluctuations of the rank of lower triangular matrices over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with i.i.d. random entries on and below the diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that given a monadically stable theory $T$, a sufficiently saturated $\mathbf M \models T$, and a coherent system of probability measures on the $\sigma$-algebras generated by parameter-definable sets of $\mathbf M$ in each dimension, we may produce a totally Borel $\mathbf B \prec \mathbf M$ realizing these measures. Our main application is to prove that every FO-convergent sequence of structures (with countable signature) from a monadically stable class admits a modeling limit. As another consequence, we prove a Borel removal lemma for monadically stable Lebesgue relational structures.</description>

      <title>The degree-restricted random process is far from uniform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree-restricted random process is a natural algorithmic model for generating graphs with degree sequence D_n=(d_1, \ldots, d_n): starting with an empty n-vertex graph, it sequentially adds new random edges so that the degree of each vertex v_i remains at most d_i. Wormald conjectured in 1999 that, for d-regular degree sequences D_n, the final graph of this process is similar to a uniform random d-regular graph.
  In this paper we show that, for degree sequences D_n that are not nearly regular, the final graph of the degree-restricted random process differs substantially from a uniform random graph with degree sequence D_n. The combinatorial proof technique is our main conceptual contribution: we adapt the switching method to the degree-restricted process, demonstrating that this enumeration technique can also be used to analyze stochastic processes (rather than just uniform random models, as before).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is called an $(r,k)$-graph if its vertex set can be partitioned into $r$ parts, each having at most $k$ vertices and there is at least one edge between any two parts. Let $f(r,H)$ be the minimum $k$ for which there exists an $H$-free $(r,k)$-graph. In this paper we build on the work of Axenovich and Martin, obtaining improved bounds on this function when $H$ is a complete bipartite graph or an even cycle. Some of these bounds are best possible up to a constant factor and confirm a conjecture of Axenovich and Martin in several cases.</description>

Abstract: The Lonely Runner Conjecture originated in Diophantine approximation is turning 60. Even if the conjecture is still widely open, the flow of partial results, innovative tools and connections to different problems and applications has been steady on its long life.

      <title>Sharp Thresholds for Factors in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a graph on $r$ vertices and let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. Then an $F$-factor in $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ composed of $n/r$ vertex-disjoint copies of $F$, if $r$ divides $n$. In other words, an $F$-factor yields a partition of the $n$ vertices of $G$. The study of such $F$-factors in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph dates back to Erd\H{o}s himself. Decades later, in 2008, Johansson, Kahn and Vu established the thresholds for the existence of an $F$-factor for strictly 1-balanced $F$ -- up to the leading constant. The sharp thresholds, meaning the leading constants, were obtained only recently by Riordan and Heckel, but only for complete graphs $F=K_r$ and for so-called nice graphs. Their results rely on sophisticated couplings that utilize the recent, celebrated solution of Shamir's problem by Kahn.
  We extend the couplings by Riordan and Heckel to any strictly 1-balanced $F$ and thereby obtain the sharp threshold for the existence of an $F$-factor. In particular, we confirm the thirty year old conjecture by Ruc\'inski that this sharp threshold indeed coincides with the sharp threshold for the disappearance of the last vertices which are not contained in a copy of $F$.</description>

      <title>The Normal Play of the Domination Game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2010, Bre\v{s}ar, Klav\v{z}ar and Rall introduced the optimization variant of the graph domination game and the game domination number, which was proved PSPACE-hard by Bre\v{s}ar et al. in 2016. In 2024, Leo Versteegen obtained the celebrated proof of the Conjecture $\frac{3}{5}$ on this variant of the domination game, proposed by Kinnersley, West and Zamani in 2013. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the normal play of the domination game, which we call Normal Domination Game, that is an impartial game where the last to play wins. We first prove that this game is PSPACE-complete even in graphs with diameter two. We also use the Sprague-Grundy theory to prove that Alice (the first player) wins in the path $P_n$ if and only if $n$ is not a multiple of $4$, and wins in the cycle $C_n$ if and only if $n=4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Moreover, we obtain a polynomial time algorithm to decide the winner for any disjoint union of paths and cycles in the Normal Domination Game and its natural partizan variant. Finally, we also prove that the Mis\`ere Domination Game (the last to play loses) is PSPACE-complete, as are the natural partizan variants of the normal game and the mis\`ere game.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, for all $k \ge 3,$ and any integers $\Delta, n$ with $n \ge \Delta,$ there exists a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ whose $4$-color Ramsey number is at least $\mathrm{tw}_k(c_k \Delta) \cdot n$, for some constant $c_k &gt; 0$, where $\mathrm{tw}_k$ denotes the tower function. This is tight up to the constant $c_k$. It extends a well-known result of Graham, R\"{o}dl and Ruci\'{n}ski for graphs and answers a question of Conlon, Fox and Sudakov from 2008.</description>

Abstract: We show that for any $\Delta \geq 3$, there is no bound computable from $(\varepsilon, r)$ on the size of a graph required to approximate a graph of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ up to $\varepsilon$ error in $r$-neighborhood statistics. This provides a negative answer to a question posed by Lov\'asz. Our result is a direct consequence of the recent celebrated work of Bowen, Chapman, Lubotzky, and Vidick, which refutes the Aldous-Lyons conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a discretization of the Hodge Laplacian, the combinatorial Laplacian of simplicial complexes has garnered significant attention. In this paper, we study combinatorial Laplacians for complex pairs $(X, A)$, where $A$ is a subcomplex of a simplicial complex $X$. We establish a relative version of the matrix-tree theorem for complex pairs, which generalizes both the matrix-tree theorem for simplicial complexes proved by Duval, Klivans, and Martin (2009) and the result for Dirichlet eigenvalues of graph pairs by Chung (1996). Furthermore, we derive several lower bounds for the spectral gaps of complex pairs and characterize the equality case for one sharp lower bound. As by-products, we obtain sufficient conditions for the vanishing of relative homology. Our results demonstrate that the combinatorial Laplacians for complex pairs are closely related to relative homology.</description>

      <title>An identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers with arithmetic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a combinatorial identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers arising from the study of peak algebra that was conjectured by Aliniaeifard and Li. This identity leads to the discovery of the intriguing identity $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{2n\choose 2k+1}2^{2n-2k}(-1)^{k}E_{2k+1}=2^{2n+1}, $$ where $E_{2k+1}$ denote the tangent numbers. Interestingly, the latter identity can be applied to prove that $(n + 1)E_{2n+1}$ is divisible by $2^{2n}$ and the quotient is an odd number, a fact whose traditional proofs require significant calculations. Moreover, we find a natural $q$-analog of the latter identity with a combinatorial proof. This $q$-identity can be applied to prove Foata's divisibility property of the $q$-tangent numbers, which responds to a problem raised by Sch\"utzenberger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A digraph with self-loops $D_S$ with vertex set $\mathcal{V}$ is a simple digraph with a self-loop attached at every vertex in $S \subset \mathcal{V}.$ In this paper, we study the energy $E(D_S)$ of $D_S$ and its properties, which extend several classical results on simple directed graphs. If $D_1,...,D_k$ are the strong components of $D_S,$ we establish a necessary and sufficient conditions for $E(D_S) \leq \sum^k_{i=1} E(D_i),$ for which the strict inequality exists for $S\neq \emptyset.$ We also provide several bounds and characterizations for the energy and spectral radius of $D_S,$ including the McClelland type bound. Lastly, we propose a notion of the complement of $D_S$ and establish some formulae describing the relationship between the energy and spectrum of regular digraphs with their complement.</description>
