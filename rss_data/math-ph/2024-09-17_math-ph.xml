      <title>Neumann Series-based Neural Operator for Solving Inverse Medium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse medium problem, inherently ill-posed and nonlinear, presents significant computational challenges. This study introduces a novel approach by integrating a Neumann series structure within a neural network framework to effectively handle multiparameter inputs. Experiments demonstrate that our methodology not only accelerates computations but also significantly enhances generalization performance, even with varying scattering properties and noisy data. The robustness and adaptability of our framework provide crucial insights and methodologies, extending its applicability to a broad spectrum of scattering problems. These advancements mark a significant step forward in the field, offering a scalable solution to traditionally complex inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Bethe ansatz approach for the steady state of the asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymmetric simple exclusion process with non-diagonal boundary terms under a specific constraint. A symmetric chiral basis is constructed and a special string solution of the Bethe ansatz equations corresponding to the steady state is presented. Using the coordinate Bethe ansatz method, we derive a concise expression for the steady state. The current and density profile in the steady state are also studied.</description>

      <title>On the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the critical finite-size gap scaling for frustration-free Hamiltonians is of inverse-square type. The novelty of this note is that the result is proved on general graphs and for general finite-range interactions. Therefore, the inverse-square critical gap scaling is a robust, universal property of finite-range frustration-free Hamiltonians. This places further limits on their ability to produce conformal field theories in the continuum limit. Our proof refines the divide-and-conquer strategy of Kastoryano and the second author through the refined Detectability Lemma of Gosset--Huang.</description>

      <title>On the Novikov problem for superposition of periodic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Novikov problem, namely, the problem of describing the level lines of quasiperiodic functions on the plane, for a special class of potentials that have important applications in the physics of two-dimensional systems. Potentials of this type are given by a superposition of periodic potentials and represent quasiperiodic functions on a plane with four quasiperiods. Here we study an important special case when the periodic potentials have the same rotational symmetry. In the generic case, their superpositions have ``chaotic'' open level lines, which brings them close to random potentials. At the same time, the Novikov problem has interesting features also for ``magic'' rotation angles, which lead to the emergence of periodic superpositions.</description>

      <title>Quantized Kepler-Coulomb dynamical models on two-dimensional constant curvature spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is continuation of [6] where we have discussed some classical and quantization problems of rigid bodies of infinitesimal size moving in Riemannian spaces. Strictly speaking, we have considered oscillatory dynamical models on sphere and pseudosphere. Here we concentrate on Kepler-Coulomb potential models. We have used formulated in [6] the two-dimensional situation on the quantum level. The Sommerfeld polynomial method is used to perform the quantization of such problems. The quantization of two-dimensional problems may have something to do with the dynamics of graphens, fullerens and nanotubes. This problem is also nearly related to the so-called restricted problems of rigid body dynamic [1], [8].</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Universality for Circular Orthogonal Polynomial Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mesoscopic fluctuations of orthogonal polynomial ensembles on the unit circle. We show that asymptotics of such fluctuations are stable under decaying perturbations of the recurrence coefficients, where the appropriate decay rate depends on the scale considered. By directly proving Gaussian limits for certain constant coefficient ensembles, we obtain mesoscopic scale Gaussian limits for a large class of orthogonal polynomial ensembles on the unit circle.
  As a corollary we prove mesocopic central limit theorems (for all mesoscopic scales) for the $\beta=2$ circular Jacobi ensembles with real parameter $\delta&gt;-1/2$.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries of remarkable (1+2)-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an original method, we find the algebra of generalized symmetries of a remarkable (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the entire class of ultraparabolic linear second-order partial differential equations with three independent variables by its wonderful symmetry properties. It turns out that the essential part of this algebra is generated by the recursion operators associated with the nilradical of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the Kolmogorov equation, and the Casimir operator of the Levi factor of the latter algebra unexpectedly arises in the consideration.</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales, whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work, we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged Euler-Poincare (LAEP) theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of non-relativistic fermions in $\mathbb R^d$ interacting through a pair potential. Employing methods developed by Buchholz in the framework of resolvent algebras, we identify an extension of the CAR algebra where the dynamics acts as a group of *-automorphisms, which are continuous in time in all sectors for fixed particle numbers. In addition, we identify a suitable dense subalgebra where the time evolution is also strongly continuous. Finally, we briefly discuss how this framework could be used to construct KMS states in the future.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition of field operators and causal measurement in quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the spectral decomposition of field operators in bosonic quantum field theory as a limit of a strongly continuous family of POVM decompositions. The latter arise from integrals over families of bounded positive operators. Crucially, these operators have the same locality properties as the underlying field operators. We use the decompositions to construct families of quantum operations implementing measurements of the field observables. Again, the quantum operations have the same locality properties as the field operators. What is more, we show that these quantum operations do not lead to superluminal signaling and are possible measurements on quantum fields in the sense of Sorkin.</description>

      <title>Mathematically established chaos in fluid dynamics: recurrent patterns forecast statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse in the Taylor-Couette system, a canonical flow that has been studied extensively for over a century, a parameter regime exhibiting dynamics that can be approximated by a simple discrete map. The map has exceptionally neat mathematical properties, allowing to prove its chaotic nature as well as the existence of infinitely many unstable periodic orbits. Remarkably, the fluid system and the discrete map share a common catalog of unstable periodic solutions with the tent map, a clear indication of topological conjugacy. A sufficient number of these solutions enables the construction of a conjugacy homeomorphism, which can be used to predict the probability density function of direct numerical simulations. These results rekindle Hopf's aspiration of elucidating turbulence through the study of recurrent patterns.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic thermalization by unitary time-evolution in the weakly perturbed two-dimensional Ising model --- An application of the Roos-Teufel-Tumulka-Vogel theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To demonstrate the implication of the recent important theorem by Roos, Teufel, Tumulka, and Vogel [1] in a simple but nontrivial example, we study thermalization in the two-dimensional Ising model in the low-temperature phase. We consider the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_L$ of the standard ferromagnetic Ising model with the plus boundary conditions and perturb it with a small self-adjoint operator $\lambda\hat{V}$ drawn randomly from the space of self-adjoint operators on the whole Hilbert space. Suppose that the system is initially in a classical spin configuration with a specified energy that may be very far from thermal equilibrium. It is proved that, for most choices of the random perturbation, the unitary time evolution $e^{-i(\hat{H}_L+\lambda\hat{V})t}$ brings the initial state into thermal equilibrium after a sufficiently long and typical time $t$, in the sense that the measurement result of the magnetization density at time $t$ almost certainly coincides with the spontaneous magnetization expected in the corresponding equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the propagation of high frequency wave-beams in highly turbulent atmospheres. Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [Bal, G. and Nair, A., arXiv:2402.17107.]</description>

      <title>Memory-Augmented Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an effective method for predicting chaotic systems by using a high-dimensional dynamic reservoir with fixed internal weights, while keeping the learning phase linear, which simplifies training and reduces computational complexity compared to fully trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) uses the exponential growth of Hilbert spaces in quantum systems, allowing for greater information processing, memory capacity, and computational power. However, the original QRC proposal requires coherent injection of inputs multiple times, complicating practical implementation. We present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that implements memory through classical post-processing of quantum measurements. This approach avoids the need for multiple coherent input injections and is evaluated on benchmark tasks, including the chaotic Mackey-Glass time series prediction. We tested our model on two physical platforms: a fully connected Ising model and a Rydberg atom array. The optimized model demonstrates promising predictive capabilities, achieving a higher number of steps compared to previously reported approaches.</description>

      <title>The Weakly Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation in Higher Dimensions with Quasi-periodic Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, under the exponential/polynomial decay condition in Fourier space, we prove that the nonlinear solution to the quasi-periodic Cauchy problem for the weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in higher dimensions will asymptotically approach the associated linear solution within a specific time scale. The proof is based on a combinatorial analysis method. Our results and methods work for {\em arbitrary} space dimensions and focusing/defocusing {\em arbitrary} power-law nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>General relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A kinetic moment-closed model, derived from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation for homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space, is introduced as a general relaxation model. The closed form of this nonlinear model is presented by introducing a set new functions called R function and R integration. This model, based on the finitely distinguishable independent features hypothesis, allows for capturing the nature of equilibrium state. From this relaxation model, a general temperature relaxation model is derived and the general characteristic frequency of temperature relaxation when velocity space exhibits spherical symmetry is presented.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Lattice Resonances and Generalised Rayleigh--Bloch Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrigue of waves on periodic lattices and gratings has resonated with physicists and mathematicians alike for decades. In-depth analysis has been devoted to the seemingly simplest array system: a one-dimensionally periodic lattice of two-dimensional scatterers embedded in a dispersionless medium governed by the Helmholtz equation. We investigate such a system and experimentally confirm the existence of a new class of generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves that have been recently theorised to exist in classical wave regimes, without the need for resonant scatterers. Airborne acoustics serves as such a regime and here we experimentally observe the first generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves above the first cut-off, i.e., in the radiative regime. We consider radiative acoustic lattice resonances along a diffraction grating and connect them to generalised Rayleigh--Bloch waves by considering both short and long arrays of non-resonant 2D cylindrical Neumann scatterers embedded in air. On short arrays, we observe finite lattice resonances under continuous wave excitation, and on long arrays, we observe propagating Rayleigh--Bloch waves under pulsed excitation. We interpret their existence by considering multiple wave scattering theory and, in doing so, unify differing nomenclatures used to describe waves on infinite periodic and finite arrays and the interpretation of their dispersive properties.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Wave Localisation in Systems of Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of metamaterials composed of high-contrast subwavelength resonators and show the existence of localised modes in such a setting. A crucial assumption in this paper is time-modulated material parameters. We prove a so-called capacitance matrix approximation of the wave equation in the form of an ordinary differential equation. These formulas set the ground for the derivation of a first-principles characterisation of localised modes in terms of the generalised capacitance matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical results supporting our analytical results showing for the first time the phenomenon of space-time localised waves in a perturbed time-modulated metamaterial. Such spatio-temporal localisation is only possible in the presence of subwavelength resonances in the unperturbed structure. We introduce the time-dependent degree of localisation to quantitatively determine the localised modes and provide a variety of numerical experiments to illustrate our formulations and results.</description>

      <title>The power of the anomaly consistency condition for the Master Ward Identity: Conservation of the non-Abelian gauge current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending local gauge tansformations in a suitable way to Faddeev-Popov ghost fields, one obtains a symmetry of the total action, i.e., the Yang-Mills action plus a gauge fixing term (in a lambda-gauge) plus the ghost action. The anomalous Master Ward Identity (for this action and this extended, local gauge transformation) states that the pertinent Noether current -- the interacting ``gauge current'' -- is conserved up to anomalies.
  It is proved that, apart from terms being easily removable (by finite renormalization), all possible anomalies are excluded by the consistency condition for the anomaly of the Master Ward Identity, recently derived in refenrence [8].</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic limit in mean field neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last five decades, mean-field neural-networks have played a crucial role in modelling associative memories and, in particular, the Hopfield model has been extensively studied using tools borrowed from the statistical mechanics of spin glasses. However, achieving mathematical control of the infinite-volume limit of the model's free-energy has remained elusive, as the standard treatments developed for spin-glasses have proven unfeasible. Here we address this long-standing problem by proving that a measure-concentration assumption for the order parameters of the theory is sufficient for the existence of the asymptotic limit of the model's free energy. The proof leverages the equivalence between the free energy of the Hopfield model and a linear combination of the free energies of a hard and a soft spin-glass, whose thermodynamic limits are rigorously known. Our work focuses on the replica-symmetry level of description (for which we recover the explicit expression of the free-energy found in the eighties via heuristic methods), yet, our scheme is expected to work also under (at least) the first step of replica symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Markovianity via local quantum Fisher information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum systems arise when the system's evolution is influenced by its past interactions with the environment. Here, we present a novel metric for quantifying non-Markovianity based on local quantum Fisher information (LQFI). The proposed metric offers a distinct perspective compared to existing measures, providing a deeper understanding of information flow between the system and its environment. By comparing the LQFI-based measure to the LQU-based measure, we demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting non-Markovianity and its ability to capture the degree of non-Markovian behavior in various quantum channels. Furthermore, we show that a positive time derivative of LQFI signals the flow of information from the environment to the system, providing a clear interpretation of non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, the computational efficiency of the LQFI-based measure makes it a practical tool for characterizing non-Markovianity in diverse physical systems.</description>

      <title>Sharp decay rate for eigenfunctions of perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates uniqueness results for perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, we consider operators of the form $H = -\Delta + V + v$, where $\Delta$ is the discrete Laplacian, $V: \mathbb{Z}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a periodic potential, and $v: \mathbb{Z}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ represents a decaying impurity. We establish quantitative conditions under which the equation $-\Delta u + V u + v u = \lambda u$, for $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, admits only the trivial solution $u \equiv 0$. Key applications include the absence of embedded eigenvalues for operators with impurities decaying faster than any exponential function and the determination of sharp decay rates for eigenfunctions. Our findings extend previous works by providing precise decay conditions for impurities and analyzing different spectral regimes of $\lambda$.</description>

We also re-derive versions of the law of large numbers and the large deviation principle, obtain the standard central limit theorem from the local one, and establish a multi-point version of the local central limit theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a formalism that aims to describe the intricacies of quantum computation by establishing a connection with the mathematical foundations of tensor theory and multilinear maps. The focus is on providing a comprehensive representation of quantum states for multiple qubits and the quantum gates that manipulate them. The proposed formalism could contribute to a more intuitive representation of qubit states, and to a clear visualisation of the entanglement property. The main advantages of this formalism are that it preserves the fundamental structure of the Hilbert space to which quantum states belong, and also reduces the computational cost associated with classical prediction of the effect of quantum gates on multi-qubit states. A connection between the ability to generate entanglement and the quantum gate representation is also established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study wormhole spacetimes in the framework of the static spherically symmetric SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory coupled to a phantom scalar field. We show rigorously the existence of an infinite sequence of symmetric wormhole solutions, labelled by the number of zeros of the Yang-Mills potential. These solutions have previously been discovered numerically. Mathematically, the problem resembles the pure Einstein-Yang-Mills system for black hole initial conditions, which was well-studied in the 90s. The main difference in the present work is that the coupling to the phantom field adds a non-trivial degree of complexity to the analysis. After proving the existence of the symmetric wormhole solutions, we also present numerical evidence for the existence of asymmetric ones.</description>

Abstract: We draw connections between contact topology and Maxwell fields in vacuo on 3-dimensional closed Riemannian submanifolds in 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds. This is accomplished by showing that contact topological methods can be applied to reveal topological features of a class of solutions to Maxwell's equations. This class of Maxwell fields is such that electric fields are parallel to magnetic fields. In addition these electromagnetic fields are composed of the so-called Beltrami fields. We employ several theorems resolving the Weinstein conjecture on closed manifolds with contact structures and stable Hamiltonian structures, where this conjecture refers to the existence of periodic orbits of the Reeb vector fields. Here a contact form is a special case of a stable Hamiltonian structure. After showing how to relate Reeb vector fields with electromagnetic 1-forms, we apply a theorem regarding contact manifolds and an improved theorem regarding stable Hamiltonian structures. Then a closed field line is shown to exist, where field lines are generated by Maxwell fields. In addition, electromagnetic energies are shown to be conserved along the Reeb vector fields.</description>

Abstract: We prove the convergence of Araki-Haag detectors in any Haag-Kastler quantum field theory with an upper and lower mass gap. We cover the case of a single Araki-Haag detector on states of bounded energy, which are selected from the absolutely continuous part of the energy-momentum spectrum sufficiently close to the lower boundary of the multi-particle spectrum. These states essentially encompass those states in the multi-particle spectrum lying below the three-particle threshold. In our proof, we draw on insights from proofs of asymptotic completeness in quantum mechanics. Notably, we apply Mourre's conjugate operator method for the first time within the framework of Haag-Kastler quantum field theory. Furthermore, we discuss applications of our findings for the problem of asymptotic completeness in local relativistic quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: We compare the structures and methods in the theory of causal fermion systems with approaches to fundamental physics based on division algebras, in particular the octonions. We find that octonions and, more generally, tensor products of division algebras come up naturally to describe the symmetries of the vacuum configuration of a causal fermion system. This is achieved by associating the real and imaginary octonion basis elements with the neutrino and charged sectors of the vacuum fermionic projector, respectively. Conversely, causal fermion systems provide octonionic theories with spacetime structures and dynamical equations via the causal action principle. In this way, octonionic theories and causal fermion systems complement each other..</description>

The derivation invokes the Dirac-Frenkel principle.

More precisely, we prove the classical LT inequalities with the semi-classical constant for this family of operators in any dimension $d\geqslant 3$ and any $\gamma \geqslant 1$. We also prove that the semi-classical constant is never optimal for the Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum (CLR) inequalities for this family of operators in any dimension. In this case, we characterize the optimal constant as the minimum of a finite set and provide an asymptotic expansion as the dimension grows. Using the same method to prove the CLR inequalities for Coulomb, we obtain more information about the conjectured optimal constant in the CLR inequality for arbitrary potentials.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights defined by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, our loop equations are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). On a simple quiver this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out. The respective partition function boils down to an integral known as Gross-Witten-Wadia model; their solution confirms the solution bootstrapped by our loop equations.</description>

      <title>Invariants of links and 3-manifolds from graph configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.09929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this self-contained book, following Edward Witten, Maxim Kontsevich, Greg Kuperberg and Dylan Thurston, we define an invariant Z of framed links in rational homology 3-spheres, and we study its properties. The invariant Z, which is often called the perturbative expansion of the Chern-Simons theory, is valued in a graded space generated by Jacobi diagrams. It counts embeddings of this kind of unitrivalent graphs in the ambient manifold, in a sense that is explained in the book, using integrals over configuration spaces, or, in a dual way, algebraic intersections in the same configuration spaces. When the ambient manifold is the standard 3-sphere, the invariant Z is a universal Vassiliev link invariant studied by many authors including Guadagnini, Martellini and Mintchev, Bar-Natan, Bott and Taubes, Altsch\"uler and Freidel, Thurston and Poirier... This book contains a more flexible definition of this invariant. We extend Z to a functor on a category of framed tangles in rational homology cylinders and we describe the behaviour of this functor under various operations including some cabling operations. We also compute iterated derivatives of our extended invariant with respect to the discrete derivatives associated to the main theories of finite type invariants. Together with recent results of Massuyeau and Moussard, our computations imply that the restriction of Z to rational homology 3-spheres (equipped with empty links) contains the same information as the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki LMO invariant for these manifolds. They also imply that the degree one part of Z is the Casson-Walker invariant.</description>

Abstract: We study a generalization of the multi-marginal optimal transport problem, which has no fixed number of marginals $N$ and is inspired of statistical mechanics. It consists in optimizing a linear combination of the costs for all the possible $N$'s, while fixing a certain linear combination of the corresponding marginals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a wide class of random quantum channels with few Kraus operators, sampled as random matrices with some sparsity and moment assumptions, typically exhibit a large spectral gap, and are therefore optimal quantum expanders. In particular, our result provides a recipe to construct random quantum expanders from their classical (random or deterministic) counterparts. This considerably enlarges the list of known constructions of optimal quantum expanders, which was previously limited to few examples. Our proofs rely on recent progress in the study of the operator norm of random matrices with dependence and non-homogeneity, which we expect to have further applications in several areas of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Theta series for quantum loop algebras and Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a family of power series, which we call Theta series, whose coefficients are in the tensor square of a quantum loop algebra. They arise from a coproduct factorization of the T-series of Frenkel--Hernandez, which are leading terms of transfer matrices of certain infinite-dimensional irreducible modules over the upper Borel subalgebra in the category O of Hernandez--Jimbo. We prove that each weight component of a Theta series is polynomial. As applications, we establish a decomposition formula and a polynomiality result for R-matrices between an irreducible module and a finite-dimensional irreducible module in category O.
  We extend T-series and Theta series to Yangians by solving difference equations determined by the truncation series of Gerasimov--Kharchev--Lebedev--Oblezin. We prove polynomiality of Theta series by interpreting them as associators for triple tensor product modules over shifted Yangians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12905v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logic gates can be written in terms of complex differential operators, where the inputs and outputs are holomorphic functions with several variables. Using the polar representation of complex numbers, we arrive at an immediate connection between the oscillatory behavior of the system and logic gates. We discuss the universality of this formalism in a variety of computing systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent generalized symmetries in ordered phases and applications to quantum disordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05730v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the rich landscape of higher-form and non-invertible symmetries that emerge at low energies in generic ordered phases. Using that their charge is carried by homotopy defects (i.e., domain walls, vortices, hedgehogs, etc.), in the absence of domain walls we find that their symmetry defects in ${D}$-dimensional spacetime are described by ${(D-1)}$-representations of a ${(D-1)}$-group that depends only on the spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) pattern of the ordered phase. These emergent symmetries are not spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. We show that spontaneously breaking them induces a phase transition into a nontrivial disordered phase that can have symmetry-enriched (non-)abelian topological orders, photons, and even more emergent symmetries. This SSB transition is between two distinct SSB phases$\unicode{x2013}$an ordinary and a generalized one$\unicode{x2013}$making it a possible generalized deconfined quantum critical point. We also investigate the 't Hooft anomalies of these emergent symmetries and conjecture that there is always a mixed anomaly between them and the microscopic symmetry spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. One way this anomaly can manifest is through the fractionalization of the microscopic symmetry's quantum numbers. Our results demonstrate that even the most exotic generalized symmetries emerge in ordinary phases and provide a valuable framework for characterizing them and their transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Counterpart of Equipartition Theorem: A M\"obius Inversion Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equipartition theorem is crucial in classical statistical physics, and recent studies have revealed its quantum counterpart for specific systems. This raises the question: does a quantum counterpart of the equipartition theorem exist for any given system, and if so, what is its concrete form? In this Letter, we employ the M\"obius inversion approach to address these questions, providing a criterion to determine whether a system adheres to the quantum counterpart of the equipartition theorem. If it does, the corresponding distribution function can be readily derived. Furthermore, we construct the fermionic version of the criterion in a manner analogous to the bosonic case.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples and weak (1,1) estimates of wave operators for fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to investigating the $L^p$-bounds of wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ associated with fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators $H=\Delta^2+V$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$. We consider that real potentials satisfy $|V(x)|\lesssim \langle x\rangle^{-\mu}$ for some $\mu&gt;0$. A recent work by Goldberg and Green \cite{GoGr21} has demonstrated that wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ under the condition that $\mu&gt;9$, and zero is a regular point of $H$. In this paper, we aim to further establish endpoint estimates for $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ in two significant ways. First, we provide counterexamples that illustrate the unboundedness of $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ on the endpoint spaces $L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ and $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$, even for non-zero compactly supported potentials $V$. Second, we establish weak (1,1) estimates for the wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ and their dual operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)^*$ in the case where zero is a regular point and $\mu&gt;11$. These estimates depend critically on the singular integral theory of Calder\'on-Zygmund on a homogeneous space $(X,d\omega)$ with a doubling measure $d\omega$.</description>

Abstract: This is an introduction to calculus, and its applications to basic questions from physics. We first discuss the theory of functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, with the notion of continuity, and the construction of the derivative $f'(x)$ and of the integral $\int_a^bf(x)dx$. Then we investigate the case of the complex functions $f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$, and notably the holomorphic functions, and harmonic functions. Then, we discuss the multivariable functions, $f:\mathbb R^N\to\mathbb R^M$ or $f:\mathbb R^N\to\mathbb C^M$ or $f:\mathbb C^N\to\mathbb C^M$, with general theory, integration results, maximization questions, and basic applications to physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Airy$_1$ process, which is the limit process in KPZ growth models with flat and non-random initial conditions. We study the persistence probability, namely the probability that the process stays below a given threshold $c$ for a time span of length $L$. This is expected to decay as $e^{-\kappa(c) L}$. We determine an analytic expression for $\kappa(c)$ for all $c\geq 3/2$ starting with the continuum statistics formula for the persistence probability. As the formula is analytic only for $c&gt;0$, we determine an analytic continuation of $\kappa(c)$ and numerically verify the validity for $c&lt;0$ as well.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We will establish (paying particular attention to large, or small, ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansions terms as linear combinations, with rational polynomial coefficients, of higher order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$. With a proper parametrization, the expansions in the Gaussian cases can be understood, for given $n$, as the limit $p\to\infty$ of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focussing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with large sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <title>Stability of slow Hamiltonian dynamics from Lieb-Robinson bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a local spin system giving rise to a slow Hamiltonian dynamics is stable against generic, even time-dependent, local perturbations. The sum of these perturbations can cover a significant amount of the system's size. The stability of the slow dynamics follows from proving that the Lieb-Robinson bound for the dynamics of the total Hamiltonian is the sum of two contributions: the Lieb-Robinson bound of the unperturbed dynamics and an additional term coming from the Lieb-Robinson bound of the perturbations with respect to the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of the study of the stability of Many-Body-Localized systems, implying that if a so called ergodic region is present in the system, to spread across a certain distance it takes a time proportional to the exponential of such distance. The non-perturbative nature of our result allows us to develop a dual description of the dynamics of a system. As a consequence we are able to prove that the presence of a region of disorder in a ergodic system implies the slowing down of the dynamics in the vicinity of that region.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>

Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <title>Variational Prior Replacement in Bayesian Inference and Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many scientific investigations require that the values of a set of model parameters are estimated using recorded data. In Bayesian inference, information from both observed data and prior knowledge is combined to update model parameters probabilistically by calculating the posterior probability distribution function. Prior information is often described by a prior probability distribution. Situations arise in which we wish to change prior information during the course of a scientific project. However, estimating the solution to any single Bayesian inference problem is often computationally costly, as it typically requires many model samples to be drawn, and the data set that would have been recorded if each sample was true must be simulated. Recalculating the Bayesian inference solution every time prior information changes can therefore be extremely expensive. We develop a mathematical formulation that allows the prior information that is embedded within a solution, to be changed using variational methods, without recalculating the original Bayesian inference. In this method, existing prior information is removed from a previously obtained posterior distribution and is replaced by new prior information. We therefore call the methodology variational prior replacement (VPR). We demonstrate VPR using a 2D seismic full waveform inversion example, in which VPR provides similar posterior solutions to those obtained by solving independent inference problems using different prior distributions. The former can be completed within minutes on a laptop computer, whereas the latter requires days of computations using high-performance computing resources. We demonstrate the value of the method by comparing the posterior solutions obtained using three different types of prior information: uniform, smoothing and geological prior distributions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-preserving deformations of integrable spin chains with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The remaining parts of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for the ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This textbook for learning geometric mechanics is written in the format of lecture notes. These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>

      <title>Generating customized field concentration via virtue surface transmission resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.</description>
