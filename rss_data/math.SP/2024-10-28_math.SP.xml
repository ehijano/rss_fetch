      <title>Continuous empirical wavelets systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed empirical wavelet transform was based on a particular type of filter. In this paper, we aim to propose a general framework for the construction of empirical wavelet systems in the continuous case. We define a well-suited formalism and then investigate some general properties of empirical wavelet systems. In particular, we provide some sufficient conditions to the existence of a reconstruction formula. In the second part of the paper, we propose the construction of empirical wavelet systems based on some classic mother wavelets.</description>

      <title>The Empirical Watershed Wavelet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical wavelet transform is an adaptive multiresolution analysis tool based on the idea of building filters on a data-driven partition of the Fourier domain. However, existing 2D extensions are constrained by the shape of the detected partitioning. In this paper, we provide theoretical results that permits us to build 2D empirical wavelet filters based on an arbitrary partitioning of the frequency domain. We also propose an algorithm to detect such partitioning from an image spectrum by combining a scale-space representation to estimate the position of dominant harmonic modes and a watershed transform to find the boundaries of the different supports making the expected partition. This whole process allows us to define the empirical watershed wavelet transform. We illustrate the effectiveness and the advantages of such adaptive transform, first visually on toy images, and next on both unsupervised texture segmentation and image deconvolution applications.</description>

      <title>The graph $\infty$-Laplacian eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze various formulations of the $\infty$-Laplacian eigenvalue problem on graphs, comparing their properties and highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. First, we investigate the graph $\infty$-eigenpairs arising as limits of $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs, extending key results from the continuous setting to the discrete domain. We prove that every limit of $p$-Laplacian eigenpair, for $p$ going to $\infty$, satisfies a limit eigenvalue equation and establish that the corresponding eigenvalue can be bounded from below by the packing radius of the graph, indexed by the number of nodal domains induced by the eigenfunction. Additionally, we show that the limits, for $p$ going to $\infty$, of the variational $p$-Laplacian eigenvalues are bounded both from above and from below by the packing radii, achieving equality for the smallest two variational eigenvalues and corresponding packing radii of the graph. In the second part of the paper, we introduce generalized $\infty$-Laplacian eigenpairs as generalized critical points and values of the $\infty$-Rayleigh quotient. We prove that the generalized variational $\infty$-eigenvalues satisfy the same upper bounds in terms of packing radii as the limit of the variational eigenvalues, again with equality holding between the smallest two $\infty$-variational eigenvalues and the first and second packing radii of the graph. Moreover, we establish that any solution to the limit eigenvalue equation is also a generalized eigenpair, while any generalized eigenpair satisfies the limit eigenvalue equation on a suitable subgraph.</description>

      <title>Some open mathematical problems on fullerenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fullerenes are hollow carbon molecules where each atom is connected to exactly three other atoms, arranged in pentagonal and hexagonal rings. Mathematically, they can be combinatorially modeled as planar, 3-regular graphs with facets composed only of pentagons and hexagons. In this work, we outline a few of the many open questions about fullerenes, beginning with the problem of generating fullerenes randomly. We then introduce an infinite family of fullerenes on which the generalized Stone-Wales operation is inapplicable. Furthermore, we present numerical insights on a graph invariant, called \textit{character} of a fullerene, derived from its adjacency and degree matrices. This descriptor may lead to a new method for linear enumeration of all fullerenes.</description>

      <title>Zariski dense non-tempered subgroups in higher rank of nearly optimal growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first example of a Zariski dense discrete non-lattice subgroup $\Gamma_0$ of a higher rank simple Lie group $G$, which is non-tempered in the sense that the associated quasi-regular representation $L^2(\Gamma_0\backslash G)$ is non-tempered. In fact, let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic $n$-manifold with properly embedded totally geodesic hyperplane for $n\ge 3$. We prove that there exists a non-empty open subset $\cal O$ of $\rm{Hom}(\Gamma, \rm{SO}(n,2))$ such that for any $\sigma\in \mathcal O$, the image $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is a Zariski dense and non-tempered Anosov subgroup of $\rm{SO}(n,2)$. Moreover the growth indicator of $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is nearly optimal, that is, it almost realizes the supremum of growth indicators of all non-lattice discrete subgroups given by property $(T)$ of $\rm{SO}(n,2)$.</description>
