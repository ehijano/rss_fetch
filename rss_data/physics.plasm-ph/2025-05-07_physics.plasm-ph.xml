      <title>An Exact Turbulence Law For the Fluid Description of Fusion Edge Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding turbulence via simplified fluid models is crucial for optimizing magnetic confinement in tokamak devices. In this work, we propose a novel high-order turbulence law that describes the turbulent cascade at the edges of fusion plasmas, namely valid within the Scrape-off Layer (SOL), in the framework of the Braginskii fluid model. Using the Yaglom-Monin approach, we derive an exact relation characterizing density fluctuations in these strongly magnetized systems. We obtain a third-order von K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation in increment form for the case of electrostatic Braginskii model, applied to a decaying turbulence regime. The new Yaglom-Braginskii law is validated through direct numerical simulations within a reduced (two-dimensional) model. Our analysis reveals that the plasma dynamics obey the cross-scale balance, exhibiting a well-defined inertial range of turbulence. This third-order law can provide an accurate measure of the cascade rate of density fluctuations in the scrape-off layer of laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Numerical Stability of Physics Models to Equilibrium Variation through Database Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High fidelity kinetic equilibria are crucial for tokamak modeling and analysis. Manual workflows for constructing kinetic equilibria are time consuming and subject to user error, motivating development of several automated equilibrium reconstruction tools to provide accurate and consistent reconstructions for downstream physics analysis. These automated tools also provide access to kinetic equilibria at large database scales, which enables the quantification of general uncertainties with sufficient statistics arising from equilibrium reconstruction techniques. In this paper, we compare a large database of DIII-D kinetic equilibria generated manually by physics experts to equilibria from the CAKE and JAKE automated kinetic reconstruction tools, assessing the impact of reconstruction method on equilibrium parameters and resulting magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability calculations. We find good agreement among scalar parameters, whereas profile quantities, such as the bootstrap current, show substantial disagreement. We analyze ideal kink and classical tearing stability with DCON and STRIDE respectively, finding that the $\delta W$ calculation is generally more robust than $\Delta^\prime$. We find that in $90\%$ of cases, both $\delta W$ stability classifications are unchanged between the manual expert and CAKE equilibria.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Effects in Single-slit Diffraction of Light at Relativistic Intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation via single-slit diffraction of relativistic laser pulses is investigated. Using fully kinetic 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we show that interesting optical phenomena emerge, including the generation of harmonic beams that are anomalously polarized orthongal to the driver, harmonic spectrum variation depending on the incident laser polarization, and a deflection of transmitted lights that leads to a tilted harmonic intensity pattern. It is shown these anomalous effects are associated with complex peripheral electron dynamics on the plasma vacuum interface. To account for these effects, a new theoretical model is developed to calculate harmonic fields from arbitrary 2D electron motion within the diffraction plane, the results agree well with the simulations. Our model indicates that the optical properties of the harmonic beams are determined by the 2D in-plane electron motion, which can be leveraged to provide immense opportunities for manipulating light-matter interaction at relativistic intensities.</description>

      <title>High-Harmonic Generation and Optical Torque Interaction via Relativistic Diffraction of a Spatiotemporal Vortex Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction of a relativistically-strong light can produce high-order harmonics via the relativistic oscillating window mechanism. In this process, the characteristics of the 2D electron dynamics at the diffraction screen can be imprinted to the generated harmonics, which provides abundant opportunities for manipulating light-matter interaction. In this work, we study single-slit diffraction of a high-intensity spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) - a beam carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). We demonstrate that due to the spatiotemporal structure of the driver, it induces differential electron oscillations on the screen, which conveys the transverse OAM to the high-order harmonic STOV beams. As a result, the topological charges of the harmonic beams are $l = nl_0$, where $l_0$ is the topological charge of the fundamental driving light, and $n$ is the harmonic order. In addition, we show that by controlling the slit angle with respect to the driver' s transverse OAM, the STOV light can exert a torque on the plasma, thus providing a way to manipulate the transverse OAM orientation of the generated harmonics.</description>

      <title>High-order exponential solver method for particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outstanding advances in solid-state laser technology, employing the optical parametric chirped-pulse-amplification (OPCPA) technique, have led physicists to focus laser pulses to highly-relativistic intensities which led to novel schemes for charged-particle acceleration and radiation generation in laser-driven plasmas. Microscopic understanding of these highly nonlinear processes is possible via accurate modeling of the laser-plasma interaction using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Numerous codes are available and they rely on finite difference time domain methods on Yee-grids or on the analytical solution of the Maxwell-equations in spectral space. In this work, we present a solution bridging these two methods, which we call finite difference exponential time domain solution. This method could provide a very high accuracy even in 3D, but with improved locality, similar to the pseudospectral analytical methods without relying on transformation to special basis functions. We verified the accuracy and the convergence of the method in various benchmarks, including laser propagation in vacuum and in underdense plasma. We also simulated electron injection in a non-linear laser-plasma wakefield acceleration and surface high-harmonic generation in the overdense regime. The results are then compared with those obtained from standard PIC codes.</description>

      <title>Understanding large-scale dynamos in unstratified rotating shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.</description>

      <title>Solar Coronal Heating: Role of Kinetic and Inertial Alfv\'en Waves in Heating and Charged Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of solar coronal heating and charged particle acceleration remains one of the most critical challenges in space and astrophysical plasma physics. In this study, we explore the contribution of Alfv\'en waves, both in their kinetic (KAWs) and inertial (IAWs) regimes, to particle acceleration processes that ultimately lead to coronal heating. Using a kinetic plasma framework based on the generalized Vlasov-Maxwell model, we analyze the dynamics of these waves with a focus on the perpendicular components of the Poynting flux vectors and the net resonance speed of the particles.
  Our results show that both the magnitude and dissipation rate of the Poynting flux for KAWs and IAWs decrease with increasing electron-to-ion temperature ratio (T_e/T_i) and normalized perpendicular electron inertial length (c k_x / omega_pe). We evaluate the associated electric potentials and find that KAWs are significantly influenced in the high wavenumber (k_x rho_i) regime. IAWs, on the other hand, show a decrease in electric potential along the magnetic field and an increase across it when the perpendicular electric field (E_x) is enhanced. We also determine the net resonant speeds of particles in the perpendicular direction and show that these wave-particle interactions can efficiently heat the solar corona over large distances (R_Sun). Finally, we quantify the power transported by KAWs and IAWs through solar flux loop tubes, finding that both wave types deliver greater energy with increasing T_e/T_i and c k_x / omega_pe. These findings offer deeper insights into wave-driven heating and are relevant to solar wind and magnetospheric physics.</description>

      <title>Computation of Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibria with Voigt Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the first numerical investigation of using Voigt regularization as a method for obtaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria without the assumption of nested magnetic flux surfaces. Voigt regularization modifies the MHD dynamics by introducing additional terms that vanish in the infinite-time limit, allowing for magnetic reconnection and the formation of magnetic islands, which can overlap and produce field-line chaos. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through numerical solutions of two-dimensional ideal and resistive test problems. Our results show that Voigt regularization can significantly accelerate the convergence to solutions in resistive MHD problems, while also highlighting challenges in applying the method to ideal MHD systems. This research opens up new possibilities for developing more efficient and robust MHD equilibrium solvers, which could contribute to the design and optimization of future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional simulations of the magnetorotational instability in eccentric disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previously we demonstrated that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) grows vigorously in eccentric disks, much as it does in circular disks, and we investigated the nonlinear development of the eccentric MRI without vertical gravity. Here we explore how vertical gravity influences the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence stirred by the eccentric MRI. Similar to eccentric disks without vertical gravity, the ratio of Maxwell stress to pressure, or the Shakura--Sunyaev alpha parameter, remains ~0.01, and the local sign flip in the Maxwell stress persists. Vertical gravity also introduces two new effects. Strong vertical compression near pericenter amplifies reconnection and dissipation, weakening the magnetic field. Angular momentum transport by MHD stresses broadens the mass distribution over eccentricity at much faster rates than without vertical gravity; as a result, spatial distributions of mass and eccentricity can be substantially modified in just ~5 to 10 orbits. MHD stresses in the eccentric debris of tidal disruption events may power emission $\gtrsim$1 yr after disruption.</description>

      <title>Relativistically Magnetized Collisionless Shocks in Pair Plasma: I. Solitons, Chaos, and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the first in a series, we present a new theoretical model for the global structure and dissipation of relativistically magnetized collisionless shock waves. Quite remarkably, we find that in contrast to unmagnetized shocks, the leading energy dissipation channel does not involve collective plasma interactions. Rather, it is a consequence of nonlinear particle dynamics. We demonstrate that the kinetic-scale shock transition can be modeled as a stationary system consisting of a large set of cold beams coupled through the magnetic field. The fundamental mechanism governing shock dissipation relies on the onset of chaos in orbital dynamics within quasiperiodic solitonic structures. We discuss the impact of upstream temperature and magnetization on the shock profile, recovering the magnetic field compression, downstream velocities, and heating expected from the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions. We deduce a rate of entropy generation from the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents and discuss the thermalization of the beam distribution. Our model provides a general framework to study magnetized collisionless shock structures.</description>

      <title>The effect of turbulence on the angular momentum of the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer of a star's angular momentum to its atmosphere is a topic of considerable and wide-ranging interest in astrophysics. This letter considers the effect of kinetic and magnetic turbulence on the solar wind's angular momentum. The effects are quantified in a theoretical framework that employs Reynolds-averaged mean field magnetohydrodynamics, allowing for fluctuations of arbitrary amplitude. The model is restricted to the solar equatorial (\(r-\phi\)) plane with axial symmetry, which permits the effect of turbulence to be expressed in analytical form as a modification to the classic Weber &amp; Davis (1967) theory, dependent on the \(r,\phi\) shear component of the Reynolds stress tensor. A solar wind simulation with turbulence transport modeling and Parker Solar Probe observations at the Alfv\'en surface are employed to quantify this turbulent modification to the solar wind's angular momentum, which is found to be ~ 3% - 10% and tends to be negative. Implications for solar and stellar rotational evolution are discussed.</description>
