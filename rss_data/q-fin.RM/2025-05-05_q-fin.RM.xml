      <title>Stochastic dominance for linear combinations of infinite-mean risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sufficient condition to compare linear combinations of independent and identically distributed (iid) infinite-mean random variables under usual stochastic order. We introduce a new class of distributions that includes many commonly used heavy-tailed distributions and show that within this class, a linear combination of random variables is stochastically larger when its weight vector is smaller in the sense of majorization order. We proceed to study the case where each random variable is a compound Poisson sum and demonstrate that if the stochastic dominance relation holds, the summand of the compound Poisson sum belongs to our new class of distributions. Additional discussions are presented for stable distributions.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Models in Asset Pricing: An Empirical Study on Large-Cap US Stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, MLP models with dynamic structure are applied to factor models for asset pricing tasks. Concretely, the MLP pyramid model structure was employed on firm-characteristic-sorted portfolio factors for modelling the large-capital US stocks. It was further developed as a practicable factor investing strategy based on the predictions. The main findings in this chapter were evaluated from two angles: model performance and investing performance, which were compared from the periods with and without COVID-19. The empirical results indicated that with the restrictions of the data size, the MLP models no longer perform "deeper, better", while the proposed MLP models with two and three hidden layers have higher flexibility to model the factors in this case. This study also verified the idea of previous works that MLP models for factor investing have more meaning in the downside risk control than in pursuing the absolute annual returns.</description>

      <title>RiskLabs: Predicting Financial Risk Using Large Language Model based on Multimodal and Multi-Sources Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering, and stock movement prediction (binary classification), the application of LLMs to financial risk prediction remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce RiskLabs, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely integrates multimodal financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data to improve financial risk prediction. Empirical results demonstrate RiskLabs' effectiveness in forecasting both market volatility and variance. Through comparative experiments, we examine the contributions of different data sources to financial risk assessment and highlight the crucial role of LLMs in this process. We also discuss the challenges associated with using LLMs for financial risk prediction and explore the potential of combining them with multimodal data for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Beating the Correlation Breakdown: Robust Inference, Flexible Scenarios, and Stress Testing for Financial Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We live in a multivariate world, and effective modeling of financial portfolios, including their construction, allocation, forecasting, and risk analysis, simply is not possible without explicitly modeling the dependence structure of their assets. Dependence structure can drive portfolio results more than the combined effects of other parameters in investment and risk models, but the literature provides relatively little to define the finite-sample distributions of dependence measures in useable and useful ways under challenging, real-world financial data conditions. Yet this is exactly what is needed to make valid inferences about their estimates, and to use these inferences for essential purposes such as hypothesis testing, dynamic monitoring, realistic and granular scenario and reverse scenario analyses, and mitigating the effects of correlation breakdowns during market upheavals. This work develops a new and straightforward method, Nonparametric Angles-based Correlation (NAbC), for defining the finite-sample distributions of any dependence measure whose matrix of pairwise associations is positive definite (e.g. Pearsons, Kendalls, Spearmans, Tail Dependence Matrix, and others). The solution remains valid under marginal asset distributions characterized by notably different and varying degrees of serial correlation, non-stationarity, heavy-tailedness, and asymmetry. Importantly, NAbCs p-values and confidence intervals remain analytically consistent at both the matrix level and the pairwise cell level. Finally, NAbC maintains validity even when selected cells in the matrix are frozen for a given scenario or stress test, thus enabling flexible, granular, and realistic scenarios. NAbC stands alone in providing all of these capabilities simultaneously, and should prove to be a very useful means by which we can better understand and manage financial portfolios in our multivariate world.</description>
