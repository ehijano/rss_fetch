      <title>Sequential Payment Rules: Approximately Fair Budget Divisions via Simple Spending Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In approval-based budget division, a budget needs to be distributed to some candidates based on the voters' approval ballots over these candidates. In the pursuit of simple, well-behaved, and approximately fair rules for this setting, we introduce the class of sequential payment rules, where each voter controls a part of the budget and repeatedly spends his share on his approved candidates to determine the final distribution. We show that all sequential payment rules satisfy a demanding population consistency notion and we identify two particularly appealing rules within this class called the maximum payment rule (MP) and the $\frac{1}{3}$-multiplicative sequential payment rule ($\frac{1}{3}$-MP). More specifically, we prove that (i) MP is, apart from one other rule, the only monotonic sequential payment rule and gives a $2$-approximation to a fairness notion called average fair share, and (ii) $\frac{1}{3}$-MP gives a $\frac{3}{2}$-approximation to average fair share, which is optimal among sequential payment rules.</description>

      <title>Games Under Network Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03124v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine settings in which agents choose behaviors and care about their neighbors' behaviors, but have incomplete information about the network in which they are embedded. We develop a model in which agents use local knowledge of their direct (and in some cases indirect) connections to make inferences about the complementarity strength of their actions with other agents in the society. Consequently, an agent's position in the network and identity plays a crucial role in determining their strategic behavior in ways that we can quantify. Our main results characterize equilibrium behaviors under various beliefs. In particular, we analyze the role of heterogeneous network information among agents in detail. For instance, we show how having people update about the network can lead those with lower degree to systematically underestimate the complementarities in the society, while those with higher degree overestimate the complementarities. We also study the inferences that agents make and the resulting behaviors in several prominent families of network architectures.</description>

      <title>Anticomonotonicity for Preference Axioms: The Natural Counterpart to Comonotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comonotonicity (``same variation'') of random variables minimizes hedging possibilities and has been widely used, e.g., in Gilboa and Schmeidler's ambiguity models. This paper investigates anticomonotonicity (``opposite variation''; abbreviated ``AC''), the natural counterpart to comonotonicity. It minimizes leveraging rather than hedging possibilities. Surprisingly, AC restrictions of several traditional axioms do not give new models. Instead, they strengthen the foundations of existing classical models: (a) linear functionals through Cauchy's equation; (b) Anscombe-Aumann expected utility; (c) as-if-risk-neutral pricing through no-arbitrage; (d) de Finetti's bookmaking foundation of Bayesianism using subjective probabilities; (e) risk aversion in Savage's subjective expected utility. In each case, our generalizations show where the critical tests of classical axioms lie: in the AC cases (maximal hedges). We next present examples where AC restrictions do essentially weaken existing axioms, and do provide new properties and new models.</description>

      <title>Matching Design with Sufficiency and Applications to Child Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many local foster care systems across the United States, child welfare practitioners struggle to effectively match children in need of a home to foster families. We tackle this problem while navigating a key sensitivity in this domain: in foster care systems, individual caseworkers must assent to any proposed matching. We codify this constraint in one-sided matching markets as the problem of matching design with sufficiency. We design a mechanism that guarantees outcome sufficiency, a form of welfare-maximizing Pareto efficiency ensuring that no caseworker can ex-post gain from any child-family placement reassignment and that the foster care authority's objective preferences for child-family placements are maximally satisfied. Our work subsequently evaluates this mechanism's strategic properties. Finally, we plan to conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment to elicit real-world caseworkers' preferences and estimate the child welfare gains our algorithm produces. Current simulation-based results show dramatic improvements to welfare. Designing sufficient matching systems is an example of mechanism-reform because replacing existing systems without regard for existing agents' preferences and wishes has previously resulted in failure.</description>
