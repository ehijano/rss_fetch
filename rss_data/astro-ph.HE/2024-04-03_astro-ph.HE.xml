      <title>Black Hole-Disk Interactions in Magnetically Arrested Active Galactic Nuclei: General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations Using A Time-Dependent, Binary Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturber objects interacting with supermassive black hole accretion disks are often invoked to explain observed quasi-periodic behavior in active galactic nuclei (AGN). We present global, 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of black holes on inclined orbits colliding with magnetically arrested thick AGN disks using a binary black hole spacetime with mass ratio $0.1$. We do this by implementing an approximate time-dependent binary black hole metric into the GRMHD code Athena++. The secondary enhances the unbound mass outflow rate 2-4 times above that provided by the disk in quasi-periodic outbursts, eventually merging into a more continuous outflow at larger distances. We present a simple analytic model that qualitatively agrees well with this result and can be used to extrapolate to unexplored regions of parameter space. We show self-consistently for the first time that spin-orbit coupling between the primary black hole spin and the binary orbital angular momentum causes the accretion disk and jet directions to precess significantly (by 60$^\circ$-80$^\circ$) on long time-scales (e.g., $\sim$ 20 times the binary orbital period). Because this effect may be the only way for thick AGN disks to consistently precess, it could provide strong evidence of a secondary black hole companion if observed in such a system. Besides this new phenomenology, the time-average properties of the disk and accretion rates onto the primary are only marginally altered by the presence of the secondary, consistent with our estimate for a perturbed thick disk. This situation might drastically change in cooled thin disks.</description>

      <title>On the association of GW190425 with its potential electromagnetic counterpart FRB 20190425A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Moroianu et al. (2022) has suggested that the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW190425 might have a potential fast radio burst (FRB) counterpart association, FRB 20190425A, at the 2.8$\sigma$ level of confidence with a likely host galaxy association, namely UGC10667. The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a long-lived hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that formed promptly after the BNS merger and was stable for approximately 2.5 hours before promptly collapsing into a black hole. The HMNS remnant is required to be a highly spinning magnetar, and due to its imminent collapse, its ejected magnetosphere potentially led to the observed FRB emission. Recently, Bhardwaj et al. (2023) conclusively associated FRB 20190425A with UGC10667, potentially providing a direct host galaxy candidate for GW190425. In this work, we examine the multi-messenger association based on the space-time localization overlaps between GW190425 and the FRB host galaxy UGC10667 and find that the odds for a coincident association are $\mathcal{O}(10)$. We validate this estimate by using a Gaussian Process (GP) density estimator. Assuming that the association is indeed real, we then perform Bayesian parameter estimation on GW190425 assuming that the BNS event took place in \GAL. We find that the viewing angle of GW190425 excludes an on-axis system at $p(\theta_v&gt;30^o)\approx99.99$\%, highly favouring an off-axis system similar to GRB 170817A. We also find a slightly higher source frame total mass for the binary, namely, $m_{\rm{total}} = 3.42^{+0.34}_{-0.11} M_{\odot}$, leading to an increase on the probability of prompt collapse into a black hole and therefore disfavors the long-lived HMNS formation scenario.</description>

      <title>Detached Circumstellar Matter as an Explanation for Slowly-Rising Interacting Type Ibc Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) supernovae (SNe) are known to have massive circumstellar matter (CSM) that are well detached from the star. Using the open-source code CHIPS, we construct a grid of models of SN Ibc interacting with detached CSM. We find that interaction with detached CSM can produce a slowly rising phase in the light curve seen in some interacting SN Ibc, which is difficult to reproduce by interaction with CSM of a density profile motivated from wind or eruptions that are continuous down to the star. We also show that SNe having double peaks in their light curves with timescales of months (e.g., SN 2022xxf) can be explained by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co, followed by interaction with detached CSM.</description>

      <title>Possible X-ray Cocoon Emission from GRB 050709</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) 050709 by the HETE-2 satellite opened a new window into understanding the nature of SGRBs, offering clues about their emission mechanism and progenitors, with the crucial aid of optical follow-up observations. Here, we revisit the prompt emission of GRB 050709. Our analysis reveals an initial hard spike ~200 ms long, followed by a subsequent soft tail emission lasting ~300 ms. These components could be common among other SGRBs originating from binary neutron merger events, such as GW/GRB 170817A. Detailed temporal and spectral analyses indicate that the soft tail emission might be attributed to the cocoon formed by the relativistic jet depositing energy into the surrounding material. We find the necessary cocoon parameters at the breakout, as consistent with numerical simulation results. We compared the physical parameters of this cocoon with those of other SGRBs. The relatively higher cocoon pressure and temperature in GRB 050709 may indicate a more on-axis jet compared to GRB 170817A and GRB 150101B.</description>

      <title>AstroSat View of the Neutron Star Low-mass X-Ray Binary GX 5-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectral and timing study of the bright NS-LMXB GX 5-1 using \textit{\textit{AstroSat}/LAXPC} and \textit{SXT} observations conducted in the year 2018. During the observation, the source traces out the complete HB and NB of the Z-track in the HID. Understanding the spectral and temporal evolution of the source along the 'Z' track can probe the accretion process in the vicinity of a neutron star. Spectral analysis was performed in the 0.7-20 keV energy range for different segments in the HID using a multi-temperature disc black body with an average temperature, $kT_{in} \sim$0.46 and a thermal Comptonization model. It is found that the optical depth of the corona drops from $\sim$6.68 in HB to $\sim$2.74 in NB. The Timing analysis using the LAXPC instrument indicates the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations in HB, NB, and the hard apex of the Z-track. The observed QPO frequencies are similar to the characteristic frequencies of horizontal branch and normal branch oscillations. The HBO frequency increase from $\sim$12-46 Hz towards the hard apex. The timing studies conducted in soft and hard band indicate the association of HBO and NBO origin with the non-thermal component. Further research could explore the implications of this relationship for understanding the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Numerical relativity simulations of black hole and relativistic jet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate impacts of stellar rotation and magnetic fields on black hole (BH) formation and its subsequent explosive activities, by conducting axisymmetric radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of gravitational collapse of a 70 $M_\odot$ star with two-moment multi energy neutrino transport in numerical relativity. Due to its dense stellar structure, all models cannot avoid the eventual BH formation even though a strongly magnetized model experiences the so-called magnetorotational explosion prior to the BH formation. One intriguing phenomenon observed in the strongly magnetized model is the formation of a relativistic jet in the post-BH formation. The relativistic jet is the outcome of a combination of strong magnetic fields and low-density materials above the BH. The jet further enhances the explosion energy beyond $\sim10^{52}$ erg, which is well exceeding the gravitational overburden ahead of the shock. Our self-consistent supernova models demonstrate that rotating magnetized massive stars at the high-mass end of supernova progenitors could be a potential candidate of hypernova and long gamma-ray burst progenitors.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction in weakly magnetized black holes: can the tail term be ignored in the strong field regime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study radiation from charged particles in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an asymptotically uniform magnetic field. In curved space, the radiation reaction force is described by the DeWitt-Brehme equation, which includes a complicated, non-local tail term. We show that, contrary to some claims in the literature, this term cannot, in general, be neglected. We account for self-force effects directly by calculating the electromagnetic energy flux at infinity and on the horizon. The radiative field is obtained using black hole perturbation theory. We solve the relevant equations analytically, in the low-frequency and slow-motion approximation, as well as numerically in the general case. Our results show that great care must be taken when neglecting the tail term, which is often fundamental to capture the dynamics of the particle: in fact, it only seems to be negligible when the magnetic force greatly dominates the gravitational force, so that the motion is well described by the Abraham--Lorentz--Dirac equation. We also report a curious "horizon dominance effect" that occurs for a radiating particle in a circular orbit around a black hole (emitting either scalar, electromagnetic or gravitational waves): for fixed orbital radius, the fraction of energy that is absorbed by the black hole can be made arbitrarily large by decreasing the particle velocity.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Cosmic Neutrino Background from NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use recent evidence of TeV neutrino events from NGC 1068, detected by the IceCube experiment, to constrain the overdensity of relic neutrinos locally and globally. Since these high-energy neutrinos have travelled long distances through a sea of relic neutrinos, they could have undergone scattering, altering their observed flux on Earth. Considering only Standard Model interactions, we constrain the relic overdensity to be $\eta\leq 3.85 \times 10^8 (5.39 \times 10^{11})$ at the 95$\%$ confidence level for overdensities with a radius of 14 Mpc (10 kpc), assuming the sum of neutrino masses saturates the cosmological bound, $\sum_i m_i = 0.13$ eV. We demonstrate that this limit improves with larger neutrino masses and how it depends on the scale of the overdensity region.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive X-ray analysis of the massive O-type binary HD93250 over two decades</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive star winds are known to be responsible for X-ray emission arising from wind plasma heated by the strong shocks up to the temperature of 10$^6$--10$^7$ K in case of colliding wind binaries. We have investigated thermal and non-thermal X-ray emission from the massive O-type star HD93250 to unveil its binary orbital parameters independently. To meet our goal, X-ray data obtained with XMM-Newton has been analyzed, spanning over $\sim$19 years. Additionally, we analyzed NuSTAR observations of HD93250 taken at various epochs. We determined the variability time-scale of the X-ray emission to be 193.8$\pm$1.3\,d, in full agreement with the 194.3$\pm$0.4\,d period derived from the astrometric orbit. The X-ray spectrum of HD93250 is well explained by a three-temperature thermal plasma emission model with temperatures of 0.26, 1.0, and 3.3 keV. The resulting X-ray flux varies in compliance with the typical colliding wind emission from eccentric massive binaries where it enhances near periastron passage and decreases gradually close to apastron, proportionally with the inverse of the binary separation. The periastron-to-apastron X-ray emission ratio points to an eccentricity range of 0.20-0.25, once again in agreement with the previously determined astrometric orbit. Finally, we did not detect any hard X-ray emission attributable to non-thermal emission above 10 keV. Given the derived plasma temperature, the strong phase-locked variability and the significant over-luminosity in X-rays, we establish that the X-ray emission from HD93250 is dominated by the colliding-wind region. Our results lend support to the idea that X-ray time analysis of massive stars constitutes a relevant tool to investigate their multiplicity and extract relevant information on their basic orbital parameters, such as the period and the eccentricity, independently of any orbital solution derived from usual techniques.</description>

      <title>Radio Scrutiny of the X-ray-Weak Tail of Low-Mass Active Galactic Nuclei: A Novel Signature of High-Eddington Accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6}$$-$$10^{10}~M_\odot$) that power luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs), i.e., quasars, generally show a correlation between thermal disk emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and coronal emission in hard X-rays. In contrast, some "massive" black holes (mBHs; $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}$$-$$10^{6}~M_\odot$) in low-mass galaxies present curious X-ray properties with coronal radiative output up to 100$\times$ weaker than expected. To examine this issue, we present new and archival 10 GHz Very Large Array observations of a sample of high-accretion-rate (Eddington ratios $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} &gt; 0.1$), mBH-powered AGNs with Chandra X-ray coverage. Empirical correlations previously revealed in samples of radio-quiet, high-Eddington AGNs indicate that the radio$-$X-ray luminosity ratio, $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$, is approximately constant. Through multiwavelength analysis, we instead find that the X-ray-weaker mBHs in our sample tend toward larger values of $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ even though they remain radio-quiet per their optical$-$UV properties. This trend results in a tentative but highly intriguing correlation between $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ and X-ray weakness, which we argue is consistent with a scenario in which X-rays may be preferentially obscured from our line of sight by a "slim" accretion disk. We compare this observation to weak emission-line quasars (AGNs with exceptionally weak broad-line emission and a significant X-ray-weak fraction) and conclude by suggesting that our results may offer a new observational signature for finding high-accretion-rate AGNs.</description>

      <title>Fast marginalization algorithm for optimizing gravitational wave detection, parameter estimation and sky localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to marginalize the likelihood for a gravitational wave signal from a quasi-circular binary merger over its extrinsic parameters, accounting for the effects of higher harmonics and spin-induced precession. The algorithm takes as input the matched-filtering time series of individual waveform harmonics against the data in all operational detectors, and the covariances of the harmonics. The outputs are the Gaussian likelihood marginalized over extrinsic parameters describing the merger time, location and orientation, along with samples from the conditional posterior of these parameters. Our algorithm exploits the waveform's known analytical dependence on extrinsic parameters to efficiently marginalize over them using a single waveform evaluation. Our current implementation achieves a 10% precision on the marginalized likelihood within $\approx 50$ ms on a single CPU core and is publicly available through the package `cogwheel`. We discuss applications of this tool for gravitational wave searches involving higher modes or precession, efficient and robust parameter estimation, and generation of sky localization maps in low latency for electromagnetic followup of gravitational-wave alerts. The inclusion of higher modes can improve the distance measurement, providing an advantage over existing low-latency localization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, an increasing number of datasets have revealed a consistent discrepancy between the number of muons measured in ultra-high-energy extensive air showers (EAS) and the numbers predicted by simulations. This gap persists despite incorporating Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data into the tuning of current hadronic interaction models, leading to the phenomenon often termed the ''muon puzzle''. To gain a deeper understanding of the potential origins of this muon puzzle, we have developed Sibyll$^{\bigstar}$, a series of phenomenologically modified versions of Sibyll 2.3d. In these models, we have increased muon production by altering $\rho^0$, baryon-antibaryon pair, or kaon production in hadronic multiparticle production processes. These variants remain within bounds from provided by accelerator measurements, including those from the LHC and fixed-target experiments, notably NA49 and NA61, showing a level of consistency comparable to Sibyll 2.3d. Our findings show that these modifications can increase the muon count in EAS by up to 35%, while minimally affecting the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm max}$) and other shower variables. Additionally, we assess the impact of these modifications on various observables, including inclusive muon and neutrino fluxes and the multiplicities of muon bundles in deep underground and water/ice Cherenkov detectors. We aim for at least one of these model variants to offer a more accurate representation of EAS data at the highest energies, thereby enhancing the quality of Monte Carlo predictions used in training neural networks. This improvement is crucial for achieving more reliable data analyses and interpretations.</description>

      <title>A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions probed by DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming neutrino experiments will soon search for new neutrino interactions more thoroughly than ever before, boosting the prospects of extending the Standard Model. In anticipation of this, we forecast the capability of two of the leading long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE and T2HK, to look for new flavor-dependent neutrino interactions with electrons, protons, and neutrons that could affect the transitions between different flavors. We interpret their sensitivity in the context of long-range neutrino interactions, mediated by a new neutral boson lighter than $10^{-10}$ eV, and sourced by the vast amount of nearby and distant matter in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and beyond. For the first time, we explore the sensitivity of DUNE and T2HK to a wide variety of $U(1)^\prime$ symmetries, built from combinations of lepton and baryon numbers, each of which induces new interactions that affect oscillations differently. We find ample sensitivity: in all cases, DUNE and T2HK may constrain the existence of the new interaction even if it is supremely feeble, may discover it, and, in some cases, may identify the symmetry responsible for it.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations hinted towards the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency band. Still, the nature of the SGWB signal cannot be confidently inferred from current data, and the leading explanation invokes mergers of supermassive black holes. If confirmed, such discovery would not only represent a turning point in our understanding of astrophysics, but it may severely limit the capability of searching for additional cosmological sources in the nHz frequency range. In this work, we build a simple framework to forecast the sensitivity of future PTA configurations and assess the parameter estimation of SGWB, which could consist of several contributions. We release the python code fastPTA implementing this framework and ready to use.</description>

      <title>Establishing accretion flares from massive black holes as a source of high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of cosmic high-energy neutrinos remains largely unexplained. For high-energy neutrino alerts from IceCube, a coincidence with time-variable emission has been seen for three different types of accreting black holes: (1) a gamma-ray flare from a blazar (TXS 0506+056), (2) an optical transient following a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE; AT2019dsg), and (3) an optical outburst from an active galactic nucleus (AGN; AT2019fdr). For the latter two sources, infrared follow-up observations revealed a powerful reverberation signal due to dust heated by the flare. This discovery motivates a systematic study of neutrino emission from all supermassive black hole with similar dust echoes. Because dust reprocessing is agnostic to the origin of the outburst, our work unifies TDEs and high-amplitude flares from AGN into a population that we dub accretion flares. Besides the two known events, we uncover a third flare that is coincident with a PeV-scale neutrino (AT2019aalc). Based solely on the optical and infrared properties, we estimate a significance of 3.6$\sigma$ for this association of high-energy neutrinos with three accretion flares. Our results imply that at least ~10% of the IceCube high-energy neutrino alerts could be due to accretion flares. This is surprising because the sum of the fluence of these flares is at least three orders of magnitude lower compared to the total fluence of normal AGN. It thus appears that the efficiency of high-energy neutrino production in accretion flares is increased compared to non-flaring AGN. We speculate that this can be explained by the high Eddington ratio of the flares.</description>

      <title>On the cusp of cusps: a universal model for extreme scattering events in the ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering structures in the ISM responsible for so-called ``extreme scattering events" (ESEs), observed in quasars and pulsars, remain enigmatic. Current models struggle to explain the high-frequency light curves of ESEs, and a recent analysis of a double lensing event in PSR\,B0834+06 reveals features of ESEs that may also be challenging to accommodate via existing models. We propose that these features arise naturally when the lens has a cusp-like profile, described by the elementary $A_3$ cusp catastrophe. This is an extension of previous work describing pulsar scintillation as arising from $A_2$ fold catastrophes in thin, corrugated plasma sheets along the line of sight. We call this framework of describing the lens potentials via elementary catastrophes ``doubly catastrophic lensing", as catastrophes (e.g. folds and cusps) have long been used to describe universal features in the light curves of lensing events that generically manifest, regardless of the precise details of the lens. Here, we argue that the lenses themselves may be described by these same elementary structures. If correct, the doubly catastrophic lensing framework would provide a unified description of scintillation and ESEs, where the lenses responsible for these scattering phenomena are universal and can be fully described by a small number of unfolding parameters. This could enable their application as giant cosmic lenses for precision measurements of coherent sources, including FRBs and pulsars.</description>

      <title>Multiple Peaks and a Long Precursor in the Type IIn Supernova 2021qqp: An Energetic Explosion in a Complex Circumstellar Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2021qqp. Its unusual light curve is marked by a long precursor for $\approx300$ days, a rapid increase in brightness for $\approx60$ days, and then a sharp increase of $\approx1.6$ mag in only a few days to a first peak of $M_r \approx -19.5$ mag. The light curve then declines rapidly until it re-brightens to a second distinct peak of $M_r \approx -17.3$ mag centered at $\approx335$ days after the first peak. The spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with a complex morphology, including a narrow component with a width of $\approx 1300$ km s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx 2500$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we associate with the circumstellar medium (CSM) and a P Cygni component with an absorption velocity of $\approx 8500$ km s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx 5600$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we associate with the SN-CSM interaction shell. Using the luminosity and velocity evolution, we construct a flexible analytical model, finding two significant mass-loss episodes with peak mass loss rates of $\approx 10$ and $\approx 5\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ about $0.8$ and $2$ yr before explosion, respectively, with a total CSM mass of $\approx 2-4\,M_{\odot}$. We show that the most recent mass-loss episode could explain the precursor for the year preceding the explosion. The SN ejecta mass is constrained to be $\approx 5-30\,M_{\odot}$ for an explosion energy of $\approx (3-10)\times10^{51}$ erg. We discuss eruptive massive stars (luminous blue variable, pulsational pair instability) and an extreme stellar merger with a compact object as possible progenitor channels.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Lepton Fluxes via Two-Dimensional Matrix Cascade Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atmospheric lepton fluxes play a crucial role in many particle and astroparticle physics experiments, e.g. in establishing the neutrino signal and the muon background for neutrino oscillation measurements, or the atmospheric background for astrophysical neutrino searches. The Matrix Cascade Equations (MCEq) code is a numerical tool used to model the atmospheric lepton fluxes by solving a system of coupled differential equations for particle production, interaction, and decay at extremely low computational costs. Previously, the MCEq framework only accommodated longitudinal development of air showers, an approximation that works well for neutrino and muon fluxes at high energies (O(10 GeV) and above). However, for accurate calculations of atmospheric lepton angular distributions at lower energies, the lateral component of hadronic cascades becomes significant, necessitating three-dimensional calculation schemes. We introduce "2D MCEq", an efficient numerical approach for combined longitudinal and angular evolution of air showers that retains the low computational complexity. The accuracy of the "2D MCEq" is affirmed by its benchmark comparison with the standard Monte Carlo code CORSIKA. This study paves the way for efficient three-dimensional calculations of atmospheric neutrino fluxes.</description>

      <title>The expansion of the GRB 221009A afterglow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) 221009A using Very Long Baseline Interferomety (VLBI) with the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), over a period spanning from 40 to 262 days after the initial GRB. The high angular resolution ($\sim$mas) of our observations allowed us, for the second time ever, after GRB 030329, to measure the projected size, $s$, of the relativistic shock caused by the expansion of the GRB ejecta into the surrounding medium. Our observations support the expansion of the shock with a $&gt;4\sigma$-equivalent significance, and confirm its relativistic nature by revealing an apparently superluminal expansion rate. Fitting a power law expansion model, $s\propto t^a$, to the observed size evolution, we find a slope $a=1.3_{-0.4}^{+0.2}$, which is steeper than expected from either a forward shock (FS) or reverse shock (RS) model, implying an apparent acceleration of the expansion. Fitting the data at each frequency separately, we find different expansion rates, pointing to a frequency-dependent behaviour. We show that the observed size evolution can be reconciled with a RS plus FS in the case of a wind-like circum-burst medium, provided that the two shocks dominate the emission at different frequencies and, possibly, at different times.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Photon Mass with Ultrawide Bandwidth Pulsar Timing Data and Dedispersed Pulses of Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring the concept of a massive photon has been an important area in astronomy and physics. If photons have mass, their propagation in nonvacuum space would be affected by both the nonzero mass $m_{\gamma}$ and the presence of a plasma medium. This would lead to a delay time proportional to $m_{\gamma}^2\nu^{-4}$, which deviates from the classical dispersion relation (proportional to $\nu^{-2}$). For the first time, we have derived the dispersion relation of a photon with a nonzero mass propagating in plasma. To reduce the impact of variations in the dispersion measure (DM), we employed the high-precision timing data to constrain the upper bound of the photon mass. Specifically, the DM/time of arrival (TOA) uncertainties derived from ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) observations conducted by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) are used. The dedispersed pulses from fast radio bursts (FRBs) with minimal scattering effects are also used to constrain the upper bound of photon mass. The stringent limit on the photon mass is determined by uncertainties of the TOA of pulsars, with an optimum value of $9.52\times 10^{-46} \, \rm kg \,\,(5.34 \times 10^{-10}\, \rm eV/c^2$). In the future, it is essential to investigate the photon mass, as pulsar timing data are collected by PTA and UWB receivers, or FRBs with wideband spectra are detected by UWB receivers.</description>

      <title>PTOLEMY's test of generalized neutrino interactions: unveiling challenges and constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unanswered questions surrounding neutrinos have motivated investigations into physics beyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics. In particular, generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) provide a broader framework for studying these effects compared to the commonly studied non-standard neutrino interactions. These interactions are described by higher dimensional operators while maintaining the gauge symmetries of the SM. Furthermore, the cosmic neutrino background, a predicted component of the SM and standard cosmology, has yet to be directly detected. To shed light on this elusive phenomenon, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relevant GNI, specifically focusing on their implications for the proposed cosmic neutrino detector PTOLEMY. We make an attempt to see the capabilities and the limitations of PTOLEMY in sensing GNI while remaining optimistic regarding PTOLEMY's experimental resolution. These interactions play a significant role in modifying the electron spectrum resulting from the capture of cosmic neutrinos on radioactive tritium. This work also explores how the presence of these interactions influences the differential electron spectrum, taking into account factors such as finite experimental resolution, the mass of the lightest neutrino eigenstate, the strength of the interactions, and the ordering of neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Forbidden Dark Matter under a Cannibally Co-Decaying Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a usual dark matter (DM) model without a huge mass difference between the DM and lighter mediator, using the coupling strength suitable for having the correct relic density, the resulting self-interaction becomes several orders of magnitude smaller than that required to interpret the small scale structures. We present a framework that can offer a solution for this point. We consider a model that contains the vector DM and a heavier but unstable Higgs-like scalar in the hidden sector. When the temperature drops below $\sim m_{\rm DM}$, the hidden sector, which is thermally decoupled from the visible sector, enters a cannibal phase, during which the DM density is depleted with the out-of-equilibrium decay of the scalar. The favored parameter region, giving the correct relic density and the proper size of self-interactions, shows the scalar-to-DM mass ratio $\in [1.1,1.33]$ and the scalar mass $\in[9,114]\,{\rm MeV}$. A sizable parameter space still survives the most current constraints and can be further probed by the near future NA62 beam dump experiment.</description>

      <title>Windows on the Universe: Establishing the Infrastructure for a Collaborative Multi-messenger Ecosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this White Paper, we present recommendations for the scientific community and funding agencies to foster the infrastructure for a collaborative multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy (MMA/TDA) ecosystem. MMA/TDA is poised for breakthrough discoveries in the coming decade. In much the same way that expanding beyond the optical bandpass revealed entirely new and unexpected discoveries, cosmic messengers beyond light (i.e., gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays) open entirely new windows to answer some of the most fundamental questions in (astro)physics: heavy element synthesis, equation of state of dense matter, particle acceleration, etc. This field was prioritized as a frontier scientific pursuit in the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics via its "New Windows on the Dynamic Universe" theme. MMA/TDA science presents technical challenges distinct from those experienced in other disciplines. Successful observations require coordination across myriad boundaries -- different cosmic messengers, ground vs. space, international borders, etc. -- all for sources that may not be well localized, and whose brightness may be changing rapidly with time. Add that all of this work is undertaken by real human beings, with distinct backgrounds, experiences, cultures, and expectations, that often conflict. To address these challenges and help MMA/TDA realize its full scientific potential in the coming decade (and beyond), the second in a series of community workshops sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA titled "Windows on the Universe: Establishing the Infrastructure for a Collaborative Multi-Messenger Ecosystem" was held on October 16-18, 2023 in Tucson, AZ. Here we present the primary recommendations from this workshop focused on three key topics -- hardware, software, and people and policy. [abridged]</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ a Galactic Low Energy Cosmic Rays tracer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Investigating the diagnostic power of H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ Charge-Exchange (CE) emission as Low-Energy Galactic Cosmic Rays(LECRs) tracer in diffuse regions. Aims. In this work, we define and test a spectroscopic indicator of CE reactions between LECRs protons and neutral hydrogen atoms of the diffuse medium. This indicator can be used for mapping LECRs density in diffuse clouds and can lead to the identification of new LECRs sources as we expect density variations caused by the distance between an observed cloud and the nearest site of particle acceleration. We also lay the foundations for the definition of a photometric indicator to be used in the next full-sky photometric surveys such as the Vera Rubin 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Methods. Based on literature cross-sections, we calculate H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line profile ratio in the case of CE and compare it with the recombination ratio. We then test our results on the Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 and we explore how the spectroscopic constraints can turn into a photometric indicator based on colour indices. Results. We find that, in shocked environments, CE between LECRS and neutral hydrogen become the dominant process for Balmer lines emission. The hydrogen spectroscopic emission is expected to be modified, with respect to the recombination Balmer decrement,to result in double the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ with respect to a similar but quiescent region. The test on the known Balmer-dominated filaments of the SNR RCW 86 confirm the efficiency of our spectroscopic indicator. Therefore we explore possible conversions of the spectroscopic indicator into colour indices combinations. This is the first step toward the definition and test of a photometric indicator for tracing LECRs to be applied in the LSST pipelines to photometrically identify new LECRs accelerators in the whole Galaxy.</description>
