      <title>Electric and magnetic waveguides in graphene: quantum and classical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic waveguides are considered in planar Dirac materials like graphene as well as their classical version for relativistic particles of zero mass and electric charge. In order to solve the Dirac-Weyl equation analytically, we have assumed the displacement symmetry of the system along a direction. In these conditions we have examined the rest of symmetries relevant each type, magnetic or electric system, which will determine their similarities and differences. We have worked out waveguides with square profile in detail to show up some of the most interesting features also in quantum and classical complementary contexts. All the results have been visualized along a series of representative graphics showing explicitly the main properties for both types of waveguides.</description>

      <title>A complex geometric perspective on a,c anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In four-dimensional conformal field theory, the numbers a and c are defined as coefficients of particular terms in the operator product expansion (OPE) of the energy-momentum tensor. With supersymmetry there are relations between these coefficients and mixed R-symmetry and gravitational anomalies. In this paper we prove a relationship between these coefficients and anomalies to holomorphic reparametrization symmetry at the level of the holomorphic twist.</description>

      <title>An Analog of the Rothe Method for Some Ill-Posed Problems for Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical method of Rothe proves existence and uniqueness theorems for initial boundary value problems for parabolic equations using the explicit finite difference scheme with respect to time. In this method, an elliptic boundary value problem is investigated on each time step. On the other hand, time dependent experimental data are always collected on discrete time grids, and the grid step size cannot be arranged to be infinitely small. The same is true for numerical studies. Therefore, it makes an applied sense to consider both unique continuation problems and coefficient inverse problems for parabolic equations, which are written in the form of finite differences with respect to time and without allowing the grid step size to tend to zero. This leads to a boundary value problem for a coupled system of elliptic equations with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary data, which is somewhat similar to the Rothe's method. Dissimilarities are named as well. Two long standing open questions are addressed within this framework. A specific applied example of monitoring epidemics is discussed. In particular, a numerical method for this problem is constructed and its global convergence analysis is provided.</description>

      <title>Isometric Spectral Subtriples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the notion of subsystem in the framework of spectral triple as a generalized notion of noncommutative submanifold. In the case of manifolds, we consider several conditions on Dirac operators which turn embedded submanifolds into isometric submanifolds. We then suggest a definition of spectral subtriple based on the notion of submanifold algebra and the already existing notions of Riemannian, isometric, and totally geodesic morphisms. We have shown that our definitions work at least in some relevant almost commutative examples.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering for repulsive potential and strong singular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work of 2014 on a quantum system governed by the repulsive Hamiltonian, the author proved uniqueness for short-range interactions described by a scattering operator consisting of regular and singular parts. In this paper, the singular part is assumed to have much stronger singularities and the same uniqueness theorem is proved. By applying the time-dependent method invented by Enss and Weder in 1995, the high-velocity limit for a wider class of the scattering operator with stronger singularities also uniquely determines uniquely the interactions of a multi-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Anomalous random flights and time-fractional run-and-tumble equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random flights (also called run-and-tumble walks or transport processes) represent finite velocity random motions changing direction at any Poissonian time. These models in d-dimension, can be studied giving a general formulation of the problem valid at any spatial dimension. The aim of this paper is to extend this general analysis to time-fractional processes arising from a non-local generalization of the kinetic equations. The probabilistic interpretation of the solution of the time-fractional equations leads to a time-changed version of the original transport processes. The obtained results provides a clear picture of the role played by the time-fractional derivatives in this kind of random motions. They displayed an anomalous behavior and are useful to describe several complex systems arising in statistical physics and biology. In particular, we focus on the one-dimensional random flight, called telegraph process, studying the time-fractional version of the classical telegraph equation and providing a suitable interpretation of its stochastic solutions.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: We classify connected \'etale algebras $A$'s in multiplicity-free modular fusion categories $\mathcal B$'s with $\text{rank}(\mathcal B)\le9$. We also identify categories $\mathcal B_A$'s of right $A$-modules. The results have physical applications in constraining renormalization group flows. As demonstration, we study massive renormalization group flows from non-unitary minimal models to predict ground state degeneracies and prove spontaneous $\mathcal B$-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Performant near-term quantum combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems with linear-depth circuits. Our algorithm uses an ansatz composed of Hamiltonian generators designed to control each term in the target combinatorial function, along with parameter updates following a modified version of quantum imaginary time evolution. We evaluate this ansatz in numerical simulations that target solutions to the MAXCUT problem. The state evolution is shown to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, and its optimal-solution convergence is further improved using adaptive transformations of the classical Hamiltonian spectrum, while resources are minimized by pruning optimized gates that are close to the identity. With these innovations, the algorithm consistently converges to optimal solutions, with interesting highly-entangled dynamics along the way. This performant and resource-minimal approach is a promising candidate for potential quantum computational advantages on near-term quantum computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Multiple operator integrals, pseudodifferential calculus, and asymptotic expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We push the definition of multiple operator integrals (MOIs) into the realm of unbounded operators, using the pseudodifferential calculus from the works of Connes and Moscovici, Higson, and Guillemin. This in particular provides a natural language for operator integrals in noncommutative geometry. For this purpose, we develop a functional calculus for these pseudodifferential operators. To illustrate the power of this framework, we provide a pertubative expansion of the spectral action for regular $s$-summable spectral triples $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, D)$, and an asymptotic expansion of $\mathrm{Tr}(P e^{-t(D+V)^2})$ as $t \downarrow 0$, where $P$ and $V$ belong to the algebra generated by $\mathcal{A}$ and $D$, and $V$ is bounded and self-adjoint.</description>

      <title>Counting $U(N)^{\otimes r}\otimes O(N)^{\otimes q}$ invariants and tensor model observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $U(N)^{\otimes r} \otimes O(N)^{\otimes q}$ invariants are constructed by contractions of complex tensors of order $r+q$, also denoted $(r,q)$. These tensors transform under $r$ fundamental representations of the unitary group $U(N)$ and $q$ fundamental representations of the orthogonal group $O(N)$. Therefore, $U(N)^{\otimes r} \otimes O(N)^{\otimes q}$ invariants are tensor model observables endowed with a tensor field of order $(r,q)$. We enumerate these observables using group theoretic formulae, for arbitrary tensor fields of order $(r,q)$. Inspecting lower-order cases reveals that, at order $(1,1)$, the number of invariants corresponds to a number of 2- or 4-ary necklaces that exhibit pattern avoidance, offering insights into enumerative combinatorics. For a general order $(r,q)$, the counting can be interpreted as the partition function of a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) with the symmetric group serving as gauge group. We identify the 2-complex pertaining to the enumeration of the invariants, which in turn defines the TQFT, and establish a correspondence with countings associated with covers of diverse topologies. For $r&gt;1$, the number of invariants matches the number of ($q$-dependent) weighted equivalence classes of branched covers of the 2-sphere with $r$ branched points. At $r=1$, the counting maps to the enumeration of branched covers of the 2-sphere with $q+3$ branched points. The formalism unveils a wide array of novel integer sequences that have not been previously documented. We also provide various codes for running computational experiments.</description>

      <title>A quantitative theory for heterogeneous combustion of nonvolatile metal particles in the diffusion-limited regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents an analytical theory quantitatively describing the heterogeneous combustion of nonvolatile (metal) particles in the diffusion-limited regime. It is assumed that the particle is suspended in an unconfined, isobaric, quiescent gaseous mixture and the chemisorption of the oxygen takes place evenly on the particle surface. The exact solution of the particle burn time is derived from the conservation equations of the gas-phase described in a spherical coordinate system with the utilization of constant thermophysical properties, evaluated at a reference film layer. This solution inherently takes the Stefan flow into account. The approximate expression of the time-dependent particle temperature is solved from the conservation of the particle enthalpy by neglecting the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the product of the transient particle density and diameter squared. Coupling the solutions for the burn time and time-dependent particle temperature provides quantitative results when initial and boundary conditions are specified. The theory is employed to predict the burn time and temperature of micro-sized iron particles, which are then compared with measurements, as the first validation case. The theoretical burn time agrees with the experiments almost perfectly at both low and high oxygen levels. The calculated particle temperature matches the measurements fairly well at relatively low oxygen mole fractions, whereas the theory overpredict the particle peak temperature due to the neglect of evaporation and the possible transition of the combustion regime.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a recent work of Dubrovin [7], for each simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we introduce an infinite family of pairwise commuting ODEs and define their $\tau$-functions. We show that these $\tau$-functions can be identified with the $\tau$-functions for the Drinfeld--Sokolov hierarchy of $\mathfrak{g}$-type. Explicit examples for $\mathfrak{g}=A_1$ and $A_2$ are provided, which are connected to the KdV hierarchy and the Boussinesq hierarchy respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over fourty years ago, the physicist Polyakov proposed a bold framework for string theory, in which the problem was reduced to the study of certain "random surfaces". He further made the tantalising suggestion that this theory could be explicitly solved. Recent breakthroughs from the last fifteen years have not only given a concrete mathematical basis for this theory but also verified some of its most striking predictions, as well as Polyakov's original vision. This theory, now known in the mathematics literature either as Liouville quantum gravity or Liouville conformal field theory, is based on a remarkable combination of ideas coming from different fields, above all probability and geometry. This book is intended to be an introduction to these developments assuming as few prerequisites as possible.</description>

      <title>Efficient unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries from permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we give an efficient construction of unitary $k$-designs using $\tilde{O}(k\cdot poly(n))$ quantum gates, as well as an efficient construction of a parallel-secure pseudorandom unitary (PRU). Both results are obtained by giving an efficient quantum algorithm that lifts random permutations over $S(N)$ to random unitaries over $U(N)$ for $N=2^n$. In particular, we show that products of exponentiated sums of $S(N)$ permutations with random phases approximately match the first $2^{\Omega(n)}$ moments of the Haar measure. By substituting either $\tilde{O}(k)$-wise independent permutations, or quantum-secure pseudorandom permutations (PRPs) in place of the random permutations, we obtain the above results. The heart of our proof is a conceptual connection between the large dimension (large-$N$) expansion in random matrix theory and the polynomial method, which allows us to prove query lower bounds at finite-$N$ by interpolating from the much simpler large-$N$ limit. The key technical step is to exhibit an orthonormal basis for irreducible representations of the partition algebra that has a low-degree large-$N$ expansion. This allows us to show that the distinguishing probability is a low-degree rational polynomial of the dimension $N$.</description>

      <title>Rapid thermalization of dissipative many-body dynamics of commuting Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems typically reach thermal equilibrium rather quickly when coupled to a thermal environment. The usual way of bounding the speed of this process is by estimating the spectral gap of the dissipative generator. However the gap, by itself, does not always yield a reasonable estimate for the thermalization time in many-body systems: without further structure, a uniform lower bound on it only constrains the thermalization time to grow polynomially with system size.
  Here, instead, we show that for a large class of geometrically-2-local models of Davies generators with commuting Hamiltonians, the thermalization time is much shorter than one would na\"ively estimate from the gap: at most logarithmic in the system size. This yields the so-called rapid mixing of dissipative dynamics. The result is particularly relevant for 1D systems, for which we prove rapid thermalization with a system size independent decay rate only from a positive gap in the generator. We also prove that systems in hypercubic lattices of any dimension, and exponential graphs, such as trees, have rapid mixing at high enough temperatures. We do this by introducing a novel notion of clustering which we call "strong local indistinguishability" based on a max-relative entropy, and then proving that it implies a lower bound on the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality (MLSI) for nearest neighbour commuting models.
  This has consequences for the rate of thermalization towards Gibbs states, and also for their relevant Wasserstein distances and transportation cost inequalities. Along the way, we show that several measures of decay of correlations on Gibbs states of commuting Hamiltonians are equivalent, a result of independent interest. At the technical level, we also show a direct relation between properties of Davies and Schmidt dynamics, that allows to transfer results of thermalization between both.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten Invariants and Mirror Symmetry for Non-Fano Varieties Using Scattering Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gromov-Witten invariants arise in the topological A-model as counts of worldsheet instantons. On the A-side, these invariants can be computed for a Fano or semi-Fano toric variety using generating functions associated to the toric divisors. On the B-side, the same invariants can be computed from the periods of the mirror. We utilize scattering diagrams (aka wall structures) in the Gross-Siebert mirror symmetry program to extend the calculation of Gromov-Witten invariants to non-Fano toric varieties. Following the work of Carl-Pumperla-Siebert, we compute corrected mirror superpotentials $\vartheta_1(\mathbb{F}_m)$ and their periods for the Hirzebruch surfaces $\mathbb{F}_m$ with $m \ge 2$.</description>

Abstract: Different from the usual harmonic oscillator, the time-decaying harmonic oscillator accelerates particles and generates scattering states. We study one of the multidimensional inverse scatterings in this two-body quantum system perturbed by short-range interaction potentials that have a bounded part and a locally singular part. Applying the Enss--Weder time-dependent method, we prove that the scattering operator determines the interaction potentials uniquely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, it has been shown that discrete and continuous media can support topologically nontrivial modes. Recently, it was shown that the same is true of the vacuum, namely, right (R) and left (L) circularly polarized photons are topologically nontrivial. Here, we study the topology of another class of massless particles, namely the gravitons. Working in the transverse-traceless gauge and the limit of weak gravity, we show that the collection of all gravitons forms a rank-two vector bundle over the lightcone. We prove the graviton bundle is topologically trivial, allowing us to discover a globally smooth basis for gravitons. It has often been assumed that there exists such a global basis consisting of linear polarized gravitons. We prove that this stronger assumption is false -- the graviton bundle has no linearly polarized subbundles. While the total graviton bundle can be decomposed into trivial line bundles, it also has a natural geometric splitting into two topologically nontrivial subbundles, consisting of the R and L gravitons. Unlike the bundles in the trivial decomposition, the R and L gravitons are unitary irreducible bundle representations of the Poincar\'{e} group, and are thus elementary particles. The nontrivial topologies of the R and L gravitons are fully characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 4$. These topologies differ from those of the R and L photons, which are characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 2$. This nontrivial topology obstructs the splitting of graviton angular momentum into spin and orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Stability and chaos in dynamical last passage percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.05837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many complex statistical mechanical models have intricate energy landscapes. The ground state, or lowest energy state, lies at the base of the deepest valley. In examples such as spin glasses and Gaussian polymers, there are many valleys; the abundance of near-ground states (at the base of valleys) indicates the phenomenon of chaos, under which the ground state alters profoundly when the model's disorder is slightly perturbed. In this article, we compute the critical exponent that governs the onset of chaos in a dynamic manifestation of a canonical model in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang [KPZ] universality class, Brownian last passage percolation [LPP]. In this model in its static form, semi-discrete polymers advance through Brownian noise, their energy given by the integral of the white noise encountered along their journey. A ground state is a geodesic, of extremal energy given its endpoints. We perturb Brownian LPP by evolving the disorder under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flow. We prove that, for polymers of length $n$, a sharp phase transition marking the onset of chaos is witnessed at the critical time $n^{-1/3}$. Indeed, the overlap between the geodesics at times zero and $t &gt; 0$ that travel a given distance of order $n$ will be shown to be of order $n$ when $t\ll n^{-1/3}$; and to be of smaller order when $t\gg n^{-1/3}$. We expect this exponent to be shared among many interface models. The present work thus sheds light on the dynamical aspect of the KPZ class; it builds on several recent advances. These include Chatterjee's harmonic analytic theory [Cha14] of equivalence of superconcentration and chaos in Gaussian spaces; a refined understanding of the static landscape geometry of Brownian LPP developed in the companion paper [GH20]; and, underlying the latter, strong comparison estimates of the geodesic energy profile to Brownian motion in [CHH19].</description>

      <title>Amoeba Formulation of Non-Bloch Band Theory in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory, in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a reduced complex space of pure dimension. We consider divergent integrals of certain forms on $X$ that are singular along a subvariety defined by the zero set of a holomorphic section of some holomorphic vector bundle $E \rightarrow X$. Given a choice of Hermitian metric on $E$ we define a finite part of the divergent integral. Our main result is an explicit formula for the dependence on the choice of metric of the finite part.</description>

      <title>A generic quantum Wielandt's inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Wielandt's inequality gives an optimal upper bound on the minimal length $k$ such that length-$k$ products of elements in a generating system span $M_n(\mathbb{C})$. It is conjectured that $k$ should be of order $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in general. In this paper, we give an overview of how the question has been studied in the literature so far and its relation to a classical question in linear algebra, namely the length of the algebra $M_n(\mathbb{C})$. We provide a generic version of quantum Wielandt's inequality, which gives the optimal length with probability one. More specifically, we prove based on [KS16] that $k$ generically is of order $\Theta(\log n)$, as opposed to the general case, in which the best bound to date is $\mathcal O(n^2 \log n)$. Our result implies a new bound on the primitivity index of a random quantum channel. Furthermore, we shed new light on a long-standing open problem for Projected Entangled Pair State, by concluding that almost any translation-invariant PEPS (in particular, Matrix Product State) with periodic boundary conditions on a grid with side length of order $\Omega( \log n )$ is the unique ground state of a local Hamiltonian. We observe similar characteristics for matrix Lie algebras and provide numerical results for random Lie-generating systems.</description>

      <title>Relaxations and Exact Solutions to Quantum Max Cut via the Algebraic Structure of Swap Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Max Cut (QMC) problem has emerged as a test-problem for designing approximation algorithms for local Hamiltonian problems. In this paper we attack this problem using the algebraic structure of QMC, in particular the relationship between the quantum max cut Hamiltonian and the representation theory of the symmetric group.
  The first major contribution of this paper is an extension of non-commutative Sum of Squares (ncSoS) optimization techniques to give a new hierarchy of relaxations to Quantum Max Cut. The hierarchy we present is based on optimizations over polynomials in the qubit swap operators. This is in contrast to the "standard" quantum Lasserre Hierarchy, which is based on polynomials expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices. To prove correctness of this hierarchy, we exploit a finite presentation of the algebra generated by the qubit swap operators. This presentation allows for the use of computer algebraic techniques to manipulate and simplify polynomials written in terms of the swap operators, and may be of independent interest. Surprisingly, we find that level-2 of this new hierarchy is numerically exact (up to tolerance 10^(-7)) on all QMC instances with uniform edge weights on graphs with at most 8 vertices.
  The second major contribution of this paper is a polynomial-time algorithm that computes (in exact arithmetic) the maximum eigenvalue of the QMC Hamiltonian for certain graphs, including graphs that can be "decomposed" as a signed combination of cliques. A special case of the latter are complete bipartite graphs with uniform edge-weights, for which exact solutions are known from the work of Lieb and Mattis. Our methods, which use representation theory of the symmetric group, can be seen as a generalization of the Lieb-Mattis result.</description>

      <title>Cut-and-paste for impulsive gravitational waves with $\Lambda$: The mathematical analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Impulsive gravitational waves are theoretical models of short but violent bursts of gravitational radiation. They are commonly described by two distinct spacetime metrics, one of local Lipschitz regularity, the other one even distributional. These two metrics are thought to be `physically equivalent' since they can be formally related by a `discontinuous coordinate transformation'. In this paper we provide a mathematical analysis of this issue for the entire class of nonexpanding impulsive gravitational waves propagating in a background spacetime of constant curvature. We devise a natural geometric regularisation procedure to show that the notorious change of variables arises as the distributional limit of a family of smooth coordinate transformations. In other words, we establish that both spacetimes arise as distributional limits of a smooth sandwich wave taken in different coordinate systems which are diffeomorphically related.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation for the isometric embedding of a Riemannian manifold $(M^n,g)$ into Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^q$. Given $\alpha \in ]\tfrac{1}{2},1]$, we show that a $C^{1,\alpha}$ embedding $u: M \to \mathbb{R}^q$ is isometric if and only if the intrinsic and extrinsic constructions of Brownian motion on $u(M)\subset \mathbb{R}^q$ yield processes with the same law. The equivalence is first established for smooth embeddings; this is followed by a renormalization procedure for $C^{1,\alpha}$ embeddings. In particular, we also construct extrinsic Brownian motion when $g \in C^2$ and $u$ is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ isometric embedding.
  This formulation is based on a gedanken experiment that relates the intrinsic and extrinsic constructions of Brownian motion on an embedded manifold to the measurement of geodesic distance by observers in distinct frames of reference. This viewpoint provides a thermodynamic formalism for the isometric embedding problem that is suited to applications in geometric deep learning, stochastic optimization and turbulence.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and ground-state entanglement spectrum of a fermionic extension of the Swanson oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the structure of the Swanson oscillator, which is a well-known example of a non-hermitian quantum system consisting of a general representation of a quadratic Hamiltonian, we propose a fermionic extension of such a scheme which incorporates two fermionic oscillators, together with bilinear-coupling terms that do not conserve particle number. We determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and expose the appearance of exceptional points where two of the eigenstates coalesce with the corresponding eigenvectors exhibiting the self-orthogonality relation. We compute the entanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy of the ground state in two different ways, with one of them being via the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction. In addition to the approach involving the usual bi-normalization of the eigenvectors of the non-hermitian Hamiltonian, we also discuss the case where the eigenvectors are normalized with respect to the Dirac norms. It is found that the model exhibits a quantum phase transition due to the presence of a ground-state crossing.</description>

      <title>Axial Anomalies of Maximally Supersymmetric Tensor Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit anomalies of $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ maximally supersymmetric tensor theories in $d=6$. A $(4,0)$ on-shell tensor multiplet descends to that of the $d=5$ maximal supergravity upon a dimensional reduction, hypothesized to offer a strong-coupled UV completion of the latter in the same sense of $(2,0)$ theories as the UV completion of $d=5$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ pure Yang-Mills. The gravitational anomalies, found to be nonvanishing, had been computed, although its relevance in the absence of the $d=6$ metric is not obvious. We perform a comprehensive anomaly computation for $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ tensor supermultiplets, respectively, for $Sp(4)$ and $Sp(3)\times Sp(1)$ $R$-symmetry anomalies and the mixed $R$-gravitational anomaly thereof, and find that anomalies involving $R$-symmetries cancel out identically. We close with questions on how to address the anomaly in this class of theories with no general covariance.</description>
