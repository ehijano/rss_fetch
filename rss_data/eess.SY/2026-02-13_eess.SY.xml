      <title>Sample-Free Safety Assessment of Neural Network Controllers via Taylor Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, artificial neural networks have been increasingly studied as feedback controllers for guidance problems. While effective in complex scenarios, they lack the verification guarantees found in classical guidance policies. Their black-box nature creates significant concerns regarding trustworthiness, limiting their adoption in safety-critical spaceflight applications. This work addresses this gap by developing a method to assess the safety of a trained neural network feedback controller via automatic domain splitting and polynomial bounding. The methodology involves embedding the trained neural network into the system's dynamical equations, rendering the closed-loop system autonomous. The system flow is then approximated by high-order Taylor polynomials, which are subsequently manipulated to construct polynomial maps that project state uncertainties onto an event manifold. Automatic domain splitting ensures the polynomials are accurate over their relevant subdomains, whilst also allowing an extensive state-space to be analysed efficiently. Utilising polynomial bounding techniques, the resulting event values may be rigorously constrained and analysed within individual subdomains, thereby establishing bounds on the range of possible closed-loop outcomes from using such neural network controllers and supporting safety assessment and informed operational decision-making in real-world missions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Estimation--Guidance Framework Based on Bayesian Decision Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Bayesian decision theory, we modify the perfect-information, differential game-based guidance law (DGL1) to address the inevitable estimation error occurring when driving this guidance law with a separately-designed state estimator. This yields a stochastic guidance law complying with the generalized separation theorem, as opposed to the common approach, that implicitly, but unjustifiably, assumes the validity of the regular separation theorem. The required posterior probability density function of the game's state is derived from the available noisy measurements using an interacting multiple model particle filter. When the resulting optimal decision turns out to be nonunique, this feature is harnessed to appropriately shape the trajectory of the pursuer so as to enhance its estimator's performance. In addition, certain properties of the particle-based computation of the Bayesian cost are exploited to render the algorithm amenable to real-time implementation. The performance of the entire estimation-decision-guidance scheme is demonstrated using an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study.</description>

      <title>Chemo Hydrodynamic Transceivers for the Internet of Bio-Nano Things, Modeling the Joint Propulsion Transmission trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) requires mobile nanomachines that navigate complex fluids while exchanging molecular signals under external supervision. We introduce the chemo-hydrodynamic transceiver, a unified model for catalytic Janus particles in which an external optical control simultaneously drives molecular emission and active self-propulsion. Unlike common abstractions that decouple mobility and communication, we derive a stochastic channel model that captures their physicochemical coupling and shows that actuation-induced distance jitter can dominate the received-signal variance, yielding a fundamental trade-off: stronger actuation increases emission but can sharply reduce reliability through motion-induced fading. Numerical results reveal a unimodal reliability profile with a critical actuation level beyond which the signal-to-noise ratio collapses, and an optimal control level that scales approximately linearly with link distance. Compared with Brownian-mobility baselines, the model exposes a pronounced estimation gap: neglecting active motility noise can underestimate the bit error probability by orders of magnitude. These findings provide physical-layer guidelines for mobility-aware IoBNT protocol design and closed-loop control of nanorobotic swarms.</description>

      <title>Power Margin Ratio -- A Large-Signal System Strength Metric for Inverter-Based Resources-Dominated Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the growing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) in modern power systems, the system strength is decreasing. Due to the inherent difference in short-circuit capacity contributions of synchronous generators and inverters, the short-circuit ratio is not a one-size-fit-all metric to assess the system strength. Following the distinct dynamic behavior of the IBR in small- and large-signal disturbance, the system strength is separated accordingly. To address the large-signal system strength assessment, a control type-dependent metric, Power Margin Ratio (PMR), is proposed in this paper. PMR is defined as the ratio between the maximum power that can be injected to the system without causing any instability and the nominal power of the IBR. It can be obtained via power flow calculation with a modified algorithm. The theoretical foundation of PMR is established from the viewpoint of dynamical systems. PMR is identical to SCR for the single-plant-infinite-bus system, while presents advancement for multi-infeed power systems. Comprehensive case studies and discussions have validated that PMR reveals the large-signal system strength from a static perspective.</description>

      <title>Non-Trivial Consensus on Directed Matrix-Weighted Networks with Cooperative and Antagonistic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the non-trivial consensus problem on directed signed matrix-weighted networks\textemdash a novel convergence state that has remained largely unexplored despite prior studies on bipartite consensus and trivial consensus. Notably, we first prove that for directed signed matrix-weighted networks, every eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacians has positive real part under certain conditions. This key finding ensures the global asymptotic convergence of systems states to the null spaces of signed matrix-weighted Laplacians, providing a foundational tool for analyzing dynamics on rooted signed matrix-weighted networks. To achieve non-trivial consensus, we propose a systematic approach involving the strategic selection of informed agents, careful design of external signals, and precise determination of coupling terms. Crucially, we derive the lower bounds of the coupling coefficients. Our consensus algorithm operates under milder connectivity conditions, and does not impose restrictions on whether the network is structurally balanced or unbalanced. Moreover, the non-trivial consensus state can be preset arbitrarily as needed. We also carry out the above analysis for undirected networks, with more relaxed conditions on the coupling coefficients comparing to the directed case. This paper further studies non-trivial consensus with switching topologies, and propose the necessary condition for the convergence of switching networks. The work in this paper demonstrates that groups with both cooperative and antagonistic multi-dimensional interactions can achieve consensus, which was previously deemed exclusive to fully cooperative groups.</description>

      <title>A day-ahead market model for power systems: benchmarking and security implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system security assessments, e.g. via cascading outage models, often use operational set-points based on optimal power flow (OPF) dispatch. However, driven by cost minimization, OPF provides an ideal, albeit unrealistic, clearing of the generating units, disregarding the complex interactions among market participants. The security of the system, therefore, may be overestimated. To address this gap, we introduce a market model with a social-welfare-based day-ahead market clearing mechanism. The security implications are analyzed via Cascades, a cascading outage analysis framework. We apply this framework to the IEEE-118 bus system with three independent control zones. The results show that market dispatch leads to an increase in demand not served of up to 80% higher than OPF, highlighting a security overestimation. Operators can use this information to properly allocate reserves and perform efficient expansion planning strategies.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Based Adaptive Prediction and Control for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates gradient-based adaptive prediction and control for nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems under a weak convexity condition on the prediction-based loss. This condition accommodates a broad range of nonlinear models in control and machine learning such as saturation functions, sigmoid, ReLU and tanh activation functions, and standard classification models. Without requiring any persistent excitation of the data, we establish global convergence of the proposed adaptive predictor and derive explicit rates for its asymptotic performance. Furthermore, under a classical nonlinear minimum-phase condition and with a linear growth bound on the nonlinearities, we establish the convergence rate of the resulting closed-loop control error. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive prediction algorithm on a real-world judicial sentencing dataset. The adaptive control performance will also be evaluated via a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Behavioral Predictive Control: State-Free Regulation Without Hankel Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents adaptive behavioral predictive control (ABPC), an indirect adaptive predictive control framework operating on streaming data. An LPV--ARX predictor is identified online via kernel--recursive least squares and used to compute closed-form predictive control sequences over a finite horizon, avoiding batch Hankel constructions and iterative optimization. Nonlinear kernel dictionaries extend model expressiveness within a behavioral formulation. Numerical studies on Hammerstein and NARX systems demonstrate effective performance when the dictionary aligns with the plant class and highlight conditioning and feature-selection effects. The paper emphasizes numerical simulation, computational feasibility, and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Circuit Modeling of Grid-Forming Inverters in (Sub)-Transient Time-Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely accepted definition of grid-forming (GFM) inverter states that it should behave as a (nearly) constant voltage source behind an impedance by maintaining a (nearly) constant internal voltage phasor in the sub-transient to transient time frame. Some system operators further mandate permissible ranges for this effective impedance. However, these specifications do not clearly define the location of the internal voltage source, and no systematic method exists to quantify its effective impedance for a black-box GFM model. To address this, we first compare the transient responses of an ideal voltage source and a GFM to show that an idealistic GFM maintains a (nearly) constant voltage across the filter capacitor, rather than at the inverter switches. Then we propose a systematic method to quantify the effective impedance of a GFM from its black-box model using frequency-domain admittance plots. Using standard PSCAD GFM models developed by NREL, we demonstrate that the GFM's equivalent impedance model captures the sub-transient response and static voltage stability limit reasonably accurately.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Error Accumulation in Continuous Navigation via Memory-Augmented Kalman Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous navigation in complex environments is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). However, the existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) models follow the dead-reckoning, which iteratively updates its position for the next waypoint prediction, and subsequently construct the complete trajectory. Then, such stepwise manner will inevitably lead to accumulated errors of position over time, resulting in misalignment between internal belief and objective coordinates, which is known as "state drift" and ultimately compromises the full trajectory prediction. Drawing inspiration from classical control theory, we propose to correct for errors by formulating such sequential prediction as a recursive Bayesian state estimation problem. In this paper, we design NeuroKalman, a novel framework that decouples navigation into two complementary processes: a Prior Prediction, based on motion dynamics and a Likelihood Correction, from historical observation. We first mathematically associate Kernel Density Estimation of the measurement likelihood with the attention-based retrieval mechanism, which then allows the system to rectify the latent representation using retrieved historical anchors without gradient updates. Comprehensive experiments on TravelUAV benchmark demonstrate that, with only 10% of the training data fine-tuning, our method clearly outperforms strong baselines and regulates drift accumulation.</description>

      <title>GHOST: Unmasking Phantom States in Mamba2 via Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection &amp; Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/mamba2_ghost-7BCB/.</description>

      <title>EM-Aware Physical Synthesis: Neural Inductor Modeling and Intelligent Placement &amp; Routing for RF Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an ML-driven framework for automated RF physical synthesis that transforms circuit netlists into manufacturable GDSII layouts. While recent ML approaches demonstrate success in topology selection and parameter optimization, they fail to produce manufacturable layouts due to oversimplified component models and lack of routing capabilities. Our framework addresses these limitations through three key innovations: (1) a neural network framework trained on 18,210 inductor geometries with frequency sweeps from 1-100 GHz, generating 7.5 million training samples, that predicts inductor Q-factor with less than 2% error and enables fast gradient-based layout optimization with a 93.77% success rate in producing high-Q layouts; (2) an intelligent P-Cell optimizer that reduces layout area while maintaining design-rule-check (DRC) compliance; and (3) a complete placement and routing engine with frequency-dependent EM spacing rules and DRC-aware synthesis. The neural inductor model demonstrates superior accuracy across 1-100 GHz, enabling EM-accurate component synthesis with real-time inference. The framework successfully generates DRC-aware GDSII layouts for RF circuits, representing a significant step toward automated RF physical design.</description>

      <title>Defining causal mechanism in dual process theory and two types of feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental events are considered to supervene on physical events. A supervenient event does not change without a corresponding change in the underlying subvenient physical events. Since wholes and their parts exhibit the same supervenience-subvenience relations, inter-level causation has been expected to serve as a model for mental causation. We proposed an inter-level causation mechanism to construct a model of consciousness and an agent's self-determination. However, a significant gap exists between this mechanism and cognitive functions. Here, we demonstrate how to integrate the inter-level causation mechanism with the widely known dual-process theories. We assume that the supervenience level is composed of multiple supervenient functions (i.e., neural networks), and we argue that inter-level causation can be achieved by controlling the feedback error defined through changing algebraic expressions combining these functions. Using inter-level causation allows for a dual laws model in which each level possesses its own distinct dynamics. In this framework, the feedback error is determined independently by two processes: (1) the selection of equations combining supervenient functions, and (2) the negative feedback error reduction to satisfy the equations through adjustments of neurons and synapses. We interpret these two independent feedback controls as Type 1 and Type 2 processes in the dual process theories. As a result, theories of consciousness, agency, and dual process theory are unified into a single framework, and the characteristic features of Type 1 and Type 2 processes are naturally derived.</description>

      <title>CL API: Real-Time Closed-Loop Interactions with Biological Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological neural networks (BNNs) are increasingly explored for their rich dynamics, parallelism, and adaptive behavior. Beyond understanding their function as a scientific endeavour, a key focus has been using these biological systems as a novel computing substrate. However, BNNs can only function as reliable information-processing systems if inputs are delivered in a temporally and structurally consistent manner. In practice, this requires stimulation with precisely controlled structure, microsecond-scale timing, multi-channel synchronization, and the ability to observe and respond to neural activity in real-time. Existing approaches to interacting with BNNs face a fundamental trade-off: they either depend on low-level hardware mechanisms, imposing prohibitive complexity for rapid iteration, or they sacrifice temporal and structural control, undermining consistency and reproducibility - particularly in closed-loop experiments. The Cortical Labs Application Programming Interface (CL API) enables real-time, sub-millisecond closed-loop interactions with BNNs. Taking a contract-based API design approach, the CL API provides users with precise stimulation semantics, transactional admission, deterministic ordering, and explicit synchronization guarantees. This contract is presented through a declarative Python interface, enabling non-expert programmers to express complex stimulation and closed-loop behavior without managing low-level scheduling or hardware details. Ultimately, the CL API provides an accessible and reproducible foundation for real-time experimentation with BNNs, supporting both fundamental biological research and emerging neurocomputing applications.</description>

      <title>Solving the Post-Quantum Control Plane Bottleneck: Energy-Aware Cryptographic Scheduling in Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) offers flexibility and innovation but introduces unique security vulnerabilities, particularly from cryptographically relevant quantum computers. While Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is the primary scalable defence, its computationally intensive handshakes create a significant bottleneck for the RAN control plane, posing sustainability challenges. This paper proposes an energy-aware framework to solve this PQC bottleneck, ensuring quantum resilience without sacrificing operational energy efficiency. The system employs an O-RAN aligned split: a Crypto Policy rApp residing in the Non-Real-Time (Non-RT) RIC defines the strategic security envelope (including PQC suites), while a Security Operations Scheduling (SOS) xApp in the Near-RT RIC converts these into tactical timing and placement intents. Cryptographic enforcement remains at standards-compliant endpoints: the Open Fronthaul utilizes Media Access Control Security (MACsec) at the O-DU/O-RU, while the xhaul (midhaul and backhaul) utilizes IP Security (IPsec) at tunnel terminators. The SOS xApp reduces PQC overhead by batching non-urgent handshakes, prioritizing session resumption, and selecting parameters that meet slice SLAs while minimizing joules per secure connection. We evaluate the architecture via a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) using 3GPP-aligned traffic profiles and verified hardware benchmarks from literature. Results show that intelligent scheduling can reduce per-handshake energy by approximately 60 percent without violating slice latency targets.</description>

      <title>Safety Beyond the Training Data: Robust Out-of-Distribution MPC via Conformalized System Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for robust out-of-distribution planning and control using conformal prediction (CP) and system level synthesis (SLS), addressing the challenge of ensuring safety and robustness when using learned dynamics models beyond the training data distribution. We first derive high-confidence model error bounds using weighted CP with a learned, state-control-dependent covariance model. These bounds are integrated into an SLS-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation, which performs constraint tightening over the prediction horizon via volume-optimized forward reachable sets. We provide theoretical guarantees on coverage and robustness under distributional drift, and analyze the impact of data density and trajectory tube size on prediction coverage. Empirically, we demonstrate our method on nonlinear systems of increasing complexity, including a 4D car and a {12D} quadcopter, improving safety and robustness compared to fixed-bound and non-robust baselines, especially outside of the data distribution.</description>

      <title>Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We first characterize the test-time scaling law for embodied instruction following and demonstrate that jointly scaling the number of rephrased instructions and generated actions greatly increases test-time sample diversity, often recovering correct actions more efficiently than scaling each dimension independently. To capitalize on these scaling laws, we present CoVer, a contrastive verifier for vision-language-action alignment, and show that our architecture scales gracefully with additional computational resources and data. We then introduce "boot-time compute" and a hierarchical verification inference pipeline for VLAs. At deployment, our framework precomputes a diverse set of rephrased instructions from a Vision-Language-Model (VLM), repeatedly generates action candidates for each instruction, and then uses a verifier to select the optimal high-level prompt and low-level action chunks. Compared to scaling policy pre-training on the same data, our verification approach yields 22% gains in-distribution and 13% out-of-distribution on the SIMPLER benchmark, with a further 45% improvement in real-world experiments. On the PolaRiS benchmark, CoVer achieves 14% gains in task progress and 9% in success rate.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Holistic Optimization in UAV-Assisted Fog Computing: Attitude, Trajectory, Task Assignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significantly enhanced fog computing by acting as both flexible computation platforms and communication mobile relays. In this paper, we consider four important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and task assignment, and propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. We first establish a fuzzy-enhanced adaptive reinforcement proportional-integral-derivative control model to control the attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in another, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing mainstream approaches.</description>

      <title>Impact Assessment of Cyberattacks in Inverter-Based Microgrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the evolution of modern power grids has been driven by the growing integration of remotely controlled grid assets. Although Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) enhance operational efficiency, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. The remote accessibility of such critical grid components creates entry points for attacks that adversaries could exploit, posing threats to the stability of the system. To evaluate the resilience of energy systems under such threats, this study employs real-time simulation and a modified version of the IEEE 39-bus system that incorporates a Microgrid (MG) with solar-based IBR. The study assesses the impact of remote attacks impacting the MG stability under different levels of IBR penetration through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. Namely, we analyze voltage, current, and frequency profiles before, during, and after cyberattack-induced disruptions. The results demonstrate that real-time HIL testing is a practical approach to uncover potential risks and develop robust mitigation strategies for resilient MG operations.</description>

      <title>Model-based controller assisted domain randomization for transient vibration suppression of nonlinear powertrain system with parametric uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex mechanical systems such as vehicle powertrains are inherently subject to multiple nonlinearities and uncertainties arising from parametric variations. Modeling errors are therefore unavoidable, making the transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a critical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling certain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical approach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints. This study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain randomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic networks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the latent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled system subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an environment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness of the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases training difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control system; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based controller based on a physics-based system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based controls, the proposed approach is smarter in that we can achieve a high level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network architecture and a smaller amount of training data. The controller is verified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain system with nonlinearities and parametric variations. Comparative tests demonstrate the high robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Regularized Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In model predictive control (MPC), the choice of cost-weighting matrices and designing the Hessian matrix directly affects the trade-off between rapid state regulation and minimizing the control effort. However, traditional MPC in quadratic programming relies on fixed design matrices across the entire horizon, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This study presents a Riccati equation-based method for adjusting the design matrix within the MPC framework, which enhances real-time performance. We employ a penalized least-squares (PLS) approach to derive a quadratic cost function for a discrete-time linear system over a finite prediction horizon. Using the method of weighting and enforcing the equality constraint by introducing a large penalty parameter, we solve the constrained optimization problem and generate control inputs for forward-shifted horizons. This process yields a recursive PLS-based Riccati equation that updates the design matrix as a regularization term in each shift, forming the foundation of the regularized MPC (Re-MPC) algorithm. To accomplish this, we provide a convergence and stability analysis of the developed algorithm. Numerical analysis demonstrates its superiority over traditional methods by allowing Riccati equation-based adjustments.</description>

      <title>Foundational Correction of Z-Transform Theory: Restoring Mathematical Completeness in Sampled-Data Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23242v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation. This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t = 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform, aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Guided Policy Search for Non-Cooperative Dynamic Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24226v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives. However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training. Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more stable learning than existing MARL methods.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose an event-triggered moving horizon estimation (ET-MHE) scheme for the remote state estimation of general nonlinear systems. In the presented method, whenever an event is triggered, a single measurement is transmitted and the nonlinear MHE optimization problem is subsequently solved. If no event is triggered, the current state estimate is updated using an open-loop prediction based on the system dynamics. Moreover, we introduce a novel event-triggering rule under which we demonstrate robust global exponential stability of the ET-MHE scheme, assuming a suitable detectability condition is met. In addition, we show that with the adoption of a varying horizon length, a tighter bound on the estimation error can be achieved. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through two illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>A Control Allocation Algorithm for Hypersonic Glide Vehicles with Input Limitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) operate in challenging flight regimes characterized by strong nonlinearities in actuation and stringent physical constraints. These include state-dependent actuator limitations, asymmetric control bounds, and thermal loads that vary with maneuvering conditions. This paper introduces an iterative control allocation method to address these challenges in real time. The proposed algorithm searches for control inputs that achieve the desired moment commands while respecting constraints on input magnitude and rate. For slender HGV configurations, thermal loads and drag generation are strongly correlated-lower drag typically results in reduced surface heating. By embedding drag-sensitive soft constraints, the method improves energy efficiency and implicitly reduces surface temperatures, lowering the vehicle's infrared signature. These features are particularly advantageous for long-range military operations that require low observability. The approach is demonstrated using the DLR's Generic Hypersonic Glide Vehicle 2 (GHGV-2) simulation model. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in maintaining control authority under realistic, constrained flight conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sample-based moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme for general nonlinear systems to estimate the current system state using irregularly and/or infrequently available measurements. The cost function of the MHE optimization problem is suitably designed to accommodate these irregular output sequences. We also establish that, under a suitable sample-based detectability condition known as sample-based incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS), the proposed sample-based MHE achieves robust global exponential stability (RGES). Additionally, for the case of linear systems, we draw connections between sample-based observability and sample-based i-IOSS. This demonstrates that previously established conditions for linear systems to be sample-based observable can be utilized to verify or design sampling strategies that satisfy the conditions to guarantee RGES of the sample-based MHE. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sample-based MHE is illustrated through a simulation example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition towards clean energy and the introduction of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) are leading to the formation of Microgrids (MGs) and Networks of MGs (NMGs). MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded mode, which requires Grid-Forming (GFM) IBRs that can perform black start, synchronization, restoration and regulation. However, such IBRs can face synchronization instability issues, which might be worsened by inadequate secondary level frequency and voltage regulation. Accordingly, we propose an autonomous and distributed synchronization and restoration scheme using Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control. To validate the proposed method, we model and simulate a high-fidelity islanded and modified IEEE 123 bus system, modeled as an NMG consisting of 7 MGs. The MATLAB/Simulink simulation results demonstrate an effective autonomous soft-start, synchronization, connection and regulation procedure using DAPI control and distributed breaker operation logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracking maneuvering targets requires estimators that are both responsive and robust. Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filters are a standard tracking approach, but fusing models via Gaussian mixtures can lag during maneuvers. Recent winnertakes-all (WTA) approaches react quickly but may produce discontinuities. We propose SAFE-IMM, a lightweight IMM variant for tracking on mobile and resource-limited platforms with a safe covariance-aware gate that permits WTA only when the implied jump from the mixture to the winner is provably bounded. In simulations and on nuScenes front-radar data, SAFE-IMM achieves high accuracy at real-time rates, reducing ID switches while maintaining competitive performance. The method is simple to integrate, numerically stable, and clutter-robust, offering a practical balance between responsiveness and smoothness.</description>

Abstract: Walking is a key movement of interest in biomechanics, yet gold-standard data collection methods are time- and cost-expensive. This paper presents a real-time, multimodal, high sample rate lower-limb motion capture framework, based on wireless wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms. Random Forests are used to estimate joint angles from IMU data, and ground reaction force (GRF) is predicted from instrumented insoles, while joint moments are predicted from angles and GRF using deep learning based on the ResNet-16 architecture. All three models achieve good accuracy compared to literature, and the predictions are logged at 1 kHz with a minimal delay of 23 ms for 20s worth of input data. The present work fully relies on wearable sensors, covers all five major lower limb joints, and provides multimodal comprehensive estimations of GRF, joint angles, and moments with minimal delay suitable for biofeedback applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Omniscient Observers for Multi-Agent Systems: Design and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes distributed omniscient observers for both heterogeneous and homogeneous linear multi-agent systems, such that each agent can correctly estimate the states of all agents. The observer design is based on local input-output information available to each agent, and knowledge of the global communication graph among agents is not necessarily required. The proposed observers can contribute to distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in multi-player games and the emergence of self-organized social behaviors in artificial swarms. Simulation results demonstrate that artificial swarms can emulate animal social behaviors, including sheepdog herding and honeybee dance-based navigation.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network-Enhanced Frequency-Constrained Optimal Power Flow with Multi-Governor Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To ensure frequency security in power systems, both the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and the frequency nadir (FN) must be explicitly accounted for in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF). However, accurately modeling sys-tem frequency dynamics through analytical formulations is chal-lenging due to their inherent nonlinearity and complexity. To address this issue, deep neural networks (DNNs) are utilized to capture the nonlinear mapping between system operating condi-tions and key frequency performance metrics. In this paper, a DNN-based frequency prediction model is developed and trained using the high-fidelity time-domain simulation data generated in PSCAD/EMTDC. The trained DNN is subsequently transformed into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) form and embedded into the FCOPF problem as additional con-straints to explicitly enforce frequency security, leading to the proposed DNN-FCOPF formulation. For benchmarking, two alternative models are considered: a conventional optimal power flow without frequency constraints and a linearized FCOPF in-corporating system-level RoCoF and FN constraints. The effec-tiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the solutions of these three models through extensive PSCAD/EMTDC time-domain simulations under various loading scenarios.</description>

      <title>Controlling Dynamical Systems into Unseen Target States Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, model-free, and data-driven methodology for controlling complex dynamical systems into previously unseen target states, including those with significantly different and complex dynamics. Leveraging a parameter-aware realization of next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC), our approach accurately predicts system behavior in unobserved parameter regimes, enabling control over transitions to arbitrary target states utilizing a new prediction evaluation and selection scheme. Crucially, this includes states with dynamics that differ fundamentally from known regimes, such as shifts from periodic to intermittent or chaotic behavior. The method's parameter awareness facilitates non-stationary control with which control scenarios are generated and evaluated on the basis of predefined control objective. In addition to proving the method for transient-free control to extrapolated chaotic target states over transition times, we demonstrate the method's effectiveness on a nonlinear power system model. Our method successfully navigates transitions even in scenarios where system collapse is observed frequently, while ensuring fast transitions and avoiding prolonged transient behavior. By extending the applicability of machine learning-based control mechanisms to previously inaccessible target dynamics, the methodology opens the door to new control applications while maintaining exceptional efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Dynamic Quadrupedal Gaits: A Symmetry-Guided RL Hierarchy Enables Free Gait Transitions at Varying Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal, morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.</description>

      <title>ETHOS: A Robotic Encountered-Type Haptic Display for Social Interaction in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social Interaction), a dynamic encountered-type haptic display (ETHD) that enables natural physical contact in virtual reality (VR) during social interactions such as handovers, fist bumps, and high-fives. The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21 ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual environments.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control via Probabilistic Inference: A Tutorial and Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial and survey on probabilistic inference-based model predictive control (PI-MPC) for robotics. PI-MPC reformulates finite-horizon optimal control as inference over an optimal control distribution expressed as a Boltzmann distribution weighted by a control prior, and generates actions through variational inference. In the tutorial part, we derive this formulation and explain action generation via variational inference, highlighting Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control as a representative algorithm with a closed-form sampling update. In the survey part, we organize existing PI-MPC research around key design dimensions, including prior design, multi-modality, constraint handling, scalability, hardware acceleration, and theoretical analysis. This paper provides a unified conceptual perspective on PI-MPC and a practical entry point for robotics researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>CONSENT: A Negotiation Framework for Leveraging User Flexibility in Vehicle-to-Building Charging under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) creates a conflict in vehicle-to-building (V2B) settings between building operators, who face high energy costs from uncoordinated charging, and drivers, who prioritize convenience and a full charge. To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.</description>
