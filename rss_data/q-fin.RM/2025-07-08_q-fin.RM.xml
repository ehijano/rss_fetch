      <title>Behavioral Probability Weighting and Portfolio Optimization under Semi-Heavy Tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework that integrates behavioral distortions into rational portfolio optimization by extracting implied probability weighting functions (PWFs) from optimal portfolios modeled under Gaussian and Normal-Inverse-Gaussian (NIG) return distributions. Using DJIA constituents, we construct mean-CVaR99 frontiers, alongwith Sharpe- and CVaR-maximizing portfolios, and estimate PWFs that capture nonlinear beliefs consistent with fear and greed. We show that increasing tail fatness amplifies these distortions and that shifts in the term structure of risk-free rates alter their curvature. The results highlight the importance of jointly modeling return asymmetry and belief distortions in portfolio risk management and capital allocation under extreme-risk environments.</description>

      <title>The connection of the stability of the binary choice model with its discriminatory power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The key indicators of model stability are the population stability index (PSI), which uses the difference in population distribution, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (KS) between two distributions. When deriving a binary choice model, the question arises about the real Gini index for any new model. The paper shows that when the Gini changes, the real Gini index should be less than the obtained Gini index. This type is included in the equation using a formula, and the PSI formula in KS is also included based on the scoring indicator. The error in calculating the Gini index of the equation is unavoidable, so it is necessary to always rely on the calculation formula. This type of research is suitable for a wide range of tasks where it is necessary to consider the error in scoring the indicator at any length.</description>

      <title>Performance-based variable premium scheme and reinsurance design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature, insurance and reinsurance pricing is typically determined by a premium principle, characterized by a risk measure that reflects the policy seller's risk attitude. Building on the work of Meyers (1980) and Chen et al. (2016), we propose a new performance-based variable premium scheme for reinsurance policies, where the premium depends on both the distribution of the ceded loss and the actual realized loss. Under this scheme, the insurer and the reinsurer face a random premium at the beginning of the policy period. Based on the realized loss, the premium is adjusted into either a ''reward'' or ''penalty'' scenario, resulting in a discount or surcharge at the end of the policy period. We characterize the optimal reinsurance policy from the insurer's perspective under this new variable premium scheme. In addition, we formulate a Bowley optimization problem between the insurer and the monopoly reinsurer. Numerical examples demonstrate that, compared to the expected-value premium principle, the reinsurer prefers the variable premium scheme as it reduces the reinsurer's total risk exposure.</description>
