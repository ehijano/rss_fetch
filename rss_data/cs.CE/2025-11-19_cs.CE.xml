      <title>Variational multiscale enrichment method for dynamic response of hyperelastic materials at finite deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we extend the variational multiscale enrichment (VME) method to model the dynamic response of hyperelastic materials undergoing large deformations. This approach enables the simulation of wave propagation under scale-inseparable conditions, including short-wavelength regimes, while accounting for material and geometric nonlinearities that lead to wave steepening or flattening. By employing an additive decomposition of the displacement field, we derive multiscale governing equations for the coarse- and fine-scale problems, which naturally incorporate micro-inertial effects. The framework allows the discretization of each unit cell with a patch of coarse-scale elements, which is essential to accurately capture wave propagation in short-wavelength regimes. An operator-split procedure is used to iteratively solve the semi-discrete equations at both scales until convergence is achieved. The coarse-scale problem is integrated explicitly, while the fine-scale problem is solved using either explicit or implicit time integration schemes, including both dissipative and non-dissipative methods. Numerical examples demonstrate that multiscale dissipative schemes effectively suppress spurious oscillations. The multiscale framework was applied to investigate how material and geometric nonlinearities, along with elastic stiffness contrast in heterogeneous microstructures, influence key wave characteristics such as dispersion, attenuation, and steepening. This multiscale computational framework provides a foundation for studying the dynamic response of architected materials.</description>

      <title>PGD-TO: A Scalable Alternative to MMA Using Projected Gradient Descent for Multi-Constraint Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) methods offer a simple and scalable approach to topology optimization (TO), yet they often struggle with nonlinear and multi-constraint problems due to the complexity of active-set detection. This paper introduces PGD-TO, a framework that reformulates the projection step into a regularized convex quadratic problem, eliminating the need for active-set search and ensuring well-posedness even when constraints are infeasible. The framework employs a semismooth Newton solver for general multi-constraint cases and a binary search projection for single or independent constraints, achieving fast and reliable convergence. It further integrates spectral step-size adaptation and nonlinear conjugate-gradient directions for improved stability and efficiency. We evaluate PGD-TO on four benchmark families representing the breadth of TO problems: (i) minimum compliance with a linear volume constraint, (ii) minimum volume under a nonlinear compliance constraint, (iii) multi-material minimum compliance with four independent volume constraints, and (iv) minimum compliance with coupled volume and center-of-mass constraints. Across these single- and multi-constraint, linear and nonlinear cases, PGD-TO achieves convergence and final compliance comparable to the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) and Optimality Criteria (OC), while reducing per-iteration computation time by 10-43x on general problems and 115-312x when constraints are independent. Overall, PGD-TO establishes a fast, robust, and scalable alternative to MMA, advancing topology optimization toward practical large-scale, multi-constraint, and nonlinear design problems.

      <title>MoMoE: A Mixture of Expert Agent Model for Financial Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach called Mixture of Mixture of Expert (MoMoE) that combines the strengths of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures with collaborative multi-agent frameworks. By modifying the LLaMA 3.1 8B architecture to incorporate MoE layers in each agent of a layered collaborative structure, we create an ensemble of specialized expert agents that iteratively refine their outputs. Each agent leverages an MoE layer in its final attention block, enabling efficient task decomposition while maintaining computational feasibility. This hybrid approach creates specialized pathways through both the model architecture and the agent collaboration layers. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements across multiple language understanding and generation benchmarks, highlighting the synergistic benefits of combining expert routing at both the neural and agent levels.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cyber-Resilience in Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems:A Methodical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) are becoming increasingly prevalent across sectors such as Industry 4.0 and smart homes, where they play a critical role in enabling intelligent, interconnected functionality. Addressing the challenges and resilience requirements of these complex environments, we propose a modified Cyber-Resilience Life-Cycle as a practical framework for sustainable risk mitigation. Our approach enhances the adaptability of CPSoS and supports resilience against evolving system complexities and potential disruptions. We conclude by outlining application scenarios for the modified life-cycle and highlighting its relevance in fostering cyber-resilience in operational systems.</description>

      <title>A Disentangled Low-Rank RNN Framework for Uncovering Neural Connectivity and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank recurrent neural networks (lrRNNs) are a class of models that uncover low-dimensional latent dynamics underlying neural population activity. Although their functional connectivity is low-rank, it lacks disentanglement interpretations, making it difficult to assign distinct computational roles to different latent dimensions. To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions. Experiments on synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data show that DisRNN consistently improves the disentanglement and interpretability of learned neural latent trajectories in low-dimensional space and low-rank connectivity over baseline lrRNNs that do not encourage partial disentanglement.</description>

      <title>Making Evidence Actionable in Adaptive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Prompt-Refined In-Context System Modelling for Financial Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid systems are increasingly used in critical applications such as medical devices, infrastructure systems, and autonomous vehicles. Lince is an academic tool for specifying and simulating such systems using a C-like language with differential equations. This paper presents recent experiments that enhance Lince with mechanisms for executing multiple simulation variants and generating histograms that quantify the frequency with which a given property holds. We illustrate our extended Lince using variations of an adaptive cruise control system.</description>

      <title>SparseST: Exploiting Data Sparsity in Spatiotemporal Modeling and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Automatic Differentiation of Agent-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape; and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.</description>

      <title>Retrosynthesis Planning via Worst-path Policy Optimisation in Tree-structured MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available building blocks, forming a synthetic tree where each internal node represents an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this formulation admits a unique optimal solution and provides monotonic improvement guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results - solving 100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by 4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data.</description>

      <title>MedBuild AI: An Agent-Based Hybrid Intelligence Framework for Reshaping Agency in Healthcare Infrastructure Planning through Generative Design for Medical Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globally, disparities in healthcare infrastructure remain stark, leaving countless communities without access to even basic services. Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.</description>
