      <title>The Rapid Arrival of Josiah Willard Gibbs's Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics in European University Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note offers an overview of how Josiah Willard Gibbs's Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics, published simultaneously in London and New York in 1902, spread through European university libraries. Contrary to the received idea that the circulation of this text was slow, information gathered through direct contacts with numerous academic libraries, together with an examination of Yale University's archives, reveals an unexpectedly rapid material diffusion beginning on 15 March 1902. This early propagation can be explained by several channels: presentation copies sent by Yale University to leading universities, personal mailings by Gibbs himself to prominent scientists, and the distribution of copies by the American publisher to major scientific journals.</description>

      <title>How are Scientific Concepts Birthed? Typing Rules of Concept Formation in Theoretical Physics Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to formalize some of the ways scientific concepts are formed in the process of theoretical physics discovery. Since this may at first seem like a task beyond the scope of the exact sciences (natural and formal sciences), we begin by presenting arguments for why scientific concept formation can be formalized. Then, we introduce type theory as a natural and well-suited framework for this formalization. We formalize what we call "ways of discovering new concepts" including concept distinction, property preservation, and concept change, as cognitive typing rules. Next, we apply these cognitive typing rules to two case studies of conceptual discovery in the history of physics: Einstein's reasoning leading to the impossibility of frozen waves, and his conceptual path to the relativity of time. In these historical episodes, we recast what a physicist might informally call "ways of discovering new scientific concepts" as compositional typing rules built from cognitive typing rules - thus formalizing them as scientific discovery mechanisms. Lastly, we computationally model the type-theoretic reconstruction of Einstein's conceptual path to the relativity of time as a program synthesis task.</description>

      <title>A Realist Approach to Quantum Individuality: Against the "Received" and "Alternative" Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we address the contemporary debate about quantum individuality expressed as an opposition between those who, like D\'ecio Krause, defend the reference of the theory to "non-individual particles", and those like Dennis Dieks, who propose instead to preserve the notion of "classical particle" as commonly applied by contemporary physicists. We will argue that these viewpoints rather than truly opposed share a common methodology which has helped to reinforce the doctrine of classical concepts that was imposed by Bohr and Dirac within the "standard" formulation --which remains the orthodox physical account of the theory of quanta. We will also discuss a recently proposed relativist yet objective relational account of quantum individuality [25] which, going back to Einstein's methodological approach, opens the doors to a completely new, truly realist understanding of quantum individuality.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics: a Modern Discipline with a Newtonian origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.</description>

      <title>Do animals share space? An explanation to Zeno's paradox (of motion)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a solution to Zeno's paradox of motion was offered and a possible, based on observations and empirical viewpoint, interpretation. A gedanken experiment was proposed in accordance to our empirical and experimental paradigm, offering solutions from pendular energy and geometric gravity theory, the standard view, and classical physics, as a reply to Zeno's paradox (of motion), departing from the logical and overly mathematical frameworks, which either offered a solution detached from experiment and observations, the former, and a solution with neither explanation nor interpretation, the latter. It takes on the problem of unmeasurable regions, Zeno's paradoxes (measure and motion), and infinitesimals, offering some insights that could be found interesting for both, metaphysical and foundations of physics fields.</description>
