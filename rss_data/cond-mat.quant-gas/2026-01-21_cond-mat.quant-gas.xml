      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional soliton in a self-repulsive spin-orbit-coupled dipolar spin-half and spin-one condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of solitons in a uniform quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) spin-orbit (SO) coupled self-repulsive pseudo spin-half and spin-one dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The dipolar atoms are taken to be polarized along the quasi-1D $x$ direction. In the pseudo spin-half case, for small SO-coupling, one can have dark-bright and bright-bright solitons. For large SO coupling, the dark-bright and bright-bright solitons may acquire a spatially-periodic modulation in density; for certain values of contact interaction paramerers there is only the normal bright-bright soliton without spatially-periodic modulation in density. In the spin-one anti-ferromagnetic case, for small SO coupling, one can have bright-bright-bright, dark-bright-dark, and bright-dark-bright solitons; and for large SO coupling, the dark-bright-dark and bright-dark-bright solitons are found to have spatially-periodic modulation in density. In the spin-one ferromagnetic case, for both small and large SO coupling, we find only bright-bright-bright solitons. All these solitons, specially those with a dark-soliton component, are dynamically stable as demonstrated by real-time propagation using the converged stationary solution obtained by imaginary-time propagation as the initial state.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets in a resonant Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the canonical problem of a Fermi gas interacting with a weakly repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. To explore the quantum phases across the full range of boson-fermion interactions, we construct a versatile variational ansatz that incorporates pair correlations and correctly captures the different polaron limits. Remarkably, we find that self-bound quantum droplets can exist in the strongly interacting regime, preempting the formation of boson-fermion dimers, when the Fermi pressure is balanced by the resonant boson-fermion attraction. This scenario can be achieved in experimentally available Bose-Fermi mixtures for a range of boson-fermion mass ratios in the vicinity of equal masses. We furthermore show that a larger fermion density instead yields phase separation between a Bose-Fermi mixture and excess fermions, as well as behavior reminiscent of a liquid-gas critical point. Our results suggest that first-order quantum phase transitions play a crucial role in the phase diagram of Bose-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of magnetically insensitive transitions in ultracold Fermi gas of $^{40}$K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of microwave single-photon transitions that are magnetic-field-insensitive in degenerate Fermi gases of $^{40}$K. This contrasts with microwave single-photon clock transitions for 0-0 magnetic-field-insensitive states and two-photon clock transitions for non 0-0 magnetic-field-insensitive states in bosonic alkali metal atoms. We show that there are two sets of special transitions between two different hyperfine ground states ($|F$=9/2, $m_{F}$=1/2$\rangle$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, -1/2$\rangle$ and $|$9/2, -1/2$\rangle$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, 1/2$\rangle$), whose microwave single-photon transition frequency is insensitive to low magnetic fields, as the first-order Zeeman shift is almost completely canceled. By using the microwave spectrum and Ramsey interference fringes, we demonstrate the long-time stability of the coherent transition under magnetic field fluctuations. These magnetic-field-insensitive microwave hyperfine transitions in ultracold $^{40}$K Fermi gases offer promising applications in quantum information and precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Collective Excitations of Bose Gases in Modified Newtonian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective excitations are fundamental in quantum many-body physics, yet their spectra have traditionally been studied within Newtonian dynamics. In this Letter, we investigate collective excitations in Bose gases under Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive an anisotropic excitation spectrum in the MOND regime. This anisotropy arises directly from the intrinsic nonlinear structure of the MOND Poisson equation, forming a distinctive signature of the modified gravitational response. We then analyze the Jeans instability, obtaining analytic expressions for the direction-dependent critical wavelength and mass. These results advance our understanding of collective behavior in quantum systems under modified dynamics and establish clear theoretical signatures for testing MOND-like effects in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and localization in a disorder-free atomic mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of random walk, in which particles or waves undergo multiple collisions with the microscopic constituents of a surrounding medium, is central to understanding diffusive transport across many research areas. However, this paradigm may break down in complex systems, where quantum interference and memory effects render the particle propagation anomalous, often fostering localization. Here we report on the observation of such anomalous dynamics in a minimal setting: an ultracold mass-imbalanced mixture of two fermionic gases in three dimensions. We release light impurities into a gas of heavier atoms and follow their evolution across different collisional regimes. Under strong interspecies interactions, by lowering the temperature we unveil a crossover from normal diffusion to subdiffusion. Simultaneously, a localized fraction of the light gas emerges, displaying no discernible dynamics over hundreds of collisions. Our findings, incompatible with the conventional Fermi-liquid picture, are instead captured by a model of an atom propagating through a (quasi-)static disordered landscape of point-like scatterers. These results highlight the key role of quantum interference in our mixture, which emerges as a versatile platform for exploring disorder-free localization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Inferring rotations using a bosonic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation and quantum tunneling are fundamental concepts in physics, and their interplay in the ultracold atomic systems is of particular interest. In this theoretical work, we explore how tunneling dynamics in a bosonic Josephson junction are modified when the system is placed in a rotating, non-inertial frame. We show that the tunneling dynamics of ultracold bosons in a two-dimensional double-well potential offer an alternative pathway for inferring the rotation frequency. Using the mean-field and many-body analyses, we demonstrate that rotation strongly modifies the tunneling time period as well as the momentum and angular momentum dynamics. When the rotation axis passes through the center of the double well, the observables show distinct dynamical responses with increasing rotation frequency, enabling the rotation frequency to be assessed from changes in the tunneling dynamics. When the potential is displaced from the rotation axis, the rotation induces asymmetric tunneling and partial self-trapping, allowing both the rotation frequency and the displacement to be inferred. We further show that for an off-centered double well, the tunneling dynamics exhibit a pronounced orientation dependence, enabling the orientation of the double well to be inferred from the observed dynamics. The many-body analysis further shows that the depletion dynamics are strongly influenced by rotation, providing an additional tool for assessing the rotation frequency. Finally, we study the effect of time-dependent rotation in which the double well is gradually set into motion in the laboratory frame and identify distinct dynamical signatures that depend sensitively on the switching time. Together, these results establish a comprehensive framework for inferring the rotation frequency, radial displacement, and orientation directly from the tunneling dynamics.</description>

      <title>Influence of intraspecies interactions on the diversity of the wetting phase diagram in dilute ternary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of intraspecies interactions on the structure and diversity of the wetting phase diagram in a dilute ternary Bose-Einstein condensates. Within the GP formalism, we employ the double-parabola approximation to describe the interfacial properties of the system in the limit of strong segregation between two of the components. Our analysis focuses on the static behavior near degenerate points where distinct phase boundaries intersect in the parameter space defined by the healing-length ratios. We demonstrate that the first-order and critical wetting transition lines, along with the nucleation line intersect at a unique degenerate point. This finding contrasts with previous studies in the interspecies interaction space, where two degenerate points were observed. These results provide new insights into the interfacial phase behavior of multicomponent quantum gases and offer theoretical guidance for experimental explorations of wetting phenomena in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature effect on a kicked Tonks-Girardeau gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely recognized that finite temperatures degrade quantum coherence and can induce thermalization. Here, we study the effect of finite temperature on a kicked Tonks--Girardeau gas, which is known to exhibit many--body dynamical localization and delocalization under periodic and quasiperiodic kicks, respectively. We find that many--body dynamical localization persists at finite--and even high--temperatures, although the coherence of the localized state is further degraded. In particular, we demonstrate a modified effective thermalization of the localized state by considering the initial temperature. Moreover, we show many--body dynamical localization transition at intermediate temperature. Our work extends the study of many--body dynamical localization and delocalization to the finite--temperature regime, providing comprehensive guidance for cold--atom experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</description>

      <title>Correlation lengths of flat-band superconductivity from quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band superconductors provide a regime in which kinetic energy is quenched, so that pairing is governed primarily by interactions and quantum geometry. We investigate characteristic superconducting length scales in all-flat-band systems under the assumptions of time-reversal symmetry and spatially-uniform pairing, focusing on the size of the lowest-lying two-body bound state, the average Cooper-pair size, and the zero-temperature coherence length in two-band Hubbard models. Using the Creutz ladder and the $\chi$ lattice as representative examples, we show that both the two-body bound-state size and the many-body Cooper-pair size remain finite and small in the weak-coupling limit, being controlled by the quantum metric of the flat bands. By contrast, the coherence length exhibits qualitatively distinct behavior, diverging in the dilute limit and in the vicinity of insulating regimes. These results demonstrate that, in flat-band superconductors, the pair size and the coherence length are fundamentally distinct physical quantities and highlight the central role of band geometry in shaping superconducting length scales when kinetic energy is quenched.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson insulator and reentrant topological transitions in a mosaic trimer lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic-potential-modulated mosaic trimer lattice. To begin with, we first investigate the topological properties of the model in the clean limit free of quasiperiodic disorder based on analytical derivation and numerical calculations of the Zak phase $Z$ and the polarization $P$. Two nontrivial topological phases corresponding to the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling, respectively, are revealed. Then we incorporate the mosaic modulation and investigate the influence of quasiperiodic disorder on the two existing topological phases. Interestingly, it turns out that quasiperiodic disorder gives rise to multiple distinct effects for different fillings. At $2/3$ filling, the topological phase is significantly enhanced by the quasiperiodic disorder and topological Anderson insulator emerges. Based on the calculations of polarization and energy gap, we explicitly present corresponding topological phase diagram in the $\lambda-J$ plane. While for the $1/3$ filling case, % the topological phase is dramatically suppressed by the same quasiperiodic disorder. the quasiperiodic disorder dramatically compresses the topological phase, and strikingly, further induces the emergence of reentrant topological phase transitions instead. Furthermore, we verify the topological phase diagrams by computing the many-body ground state fidelity susceptibility for both the $1/3$ filling and $2/3$ filling cases. Our work exemplifies the diverse roles of quasiperiodic disorder in the modulation of topological properties, and will further inspire more research on the competitive and cooperative interplay between topological properties and quasiperiodic disorder.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of quartet superfluid state: Quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and generalized Nambu-Gor'kov formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a quartet superfluid state in fermionic matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) variational theory and the Green's function method. We demonstrate that the quartet BCS theory with the multiple-infinite-product ansatz successfully reproduces an exact four-body result in a one-dimensional four-component Fermi gas at the dilute limit, in contrast to the single-infinite-product ansatz. To see the validity of the quartet BCS state, we derive the self-consistent equation for the quartet superfluid order parameter within the generalized imaginary-time Nambu-Gor'kov formalism, which is found to be consistent with the quartet BCS variational equation. Moreover, by numerically computing the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function in a one-dimensional system, we discuss how the single-particle spectra evolve with increasing the strength of the four-body cluster formation. We show that a coherent BCS-like quasiparticle branch on the weak-coupling side evolves into a strongly damped, continuum-dominated spectrum in the strong-coupling side, while nonzero quartet superfluid order parameter persists throughout the crossover regime. Our results would be useful for understanding beyond-BCS pairing effects and four-body cluster formations in fermionic systems in an interdisciplinary way.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transitions in one-dimensional correlated Fermi gases with cavity-induced umklapp scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superradiant phase transitions of one-dimensional correlated Fermi gases in a transversely driven optical cavity, under the umklapp condition that the cavity wave number is equal to two times the Fermi wave number, are studied with bosonization and renormalization group techniques. The bosonization of Fermi fields gives rise to an all-to-all sine-Gordon (SG) model due to the cavity-assisted nonlocal interactions, where the Bose fields at any two spatial points are coupled. The superradiant phase transition is then mapped to the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition of the all-to-all SG model. The nesting effect, in which the superradiant phase transition can be triggered by an infinitely small atom-cavity coupling strength, is shown to be preserved for any nonattractive local interactions. For attractive local interactions, the phase transition occurs at a finite critical coupling strength. Nevertheless, the analysis of the scaling dimension indicates that the perturbation of the nonlocal cosine term is indeed relevant (irrelevant) when the scaling dimension is lower (higher) than the critical dimension, similar to the case of an ordinary local SG model. Our work provides an analytical framework for understanding the superradiant phase transitions in low-dimensional correlated intracavity Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced chiral-transport inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the chiral dynamics of locally interacting bosons in a two-leg flux ladder, where on-site interactions, despite being fully isotropic, counterintuitively reverse the flux-induced chiral transport of density distribution. For a Bose-Einstein condensate (in the mean-field regime), this reversal arises from an interactiondriven dynamical band-occupation inversion, which selectively populates single-particle states of the opposing chirality. Strikingly, the chiral-transport inversion has a few-body, hence beyond-mean-field, origin, as the formation of two-body bound states with reversed chirality dominates the few-body dynamics. This dual pathway, that is, occupation inversion and bound-state formation, underlies the chiral-transport inversion, which challenges the conventional wisdom that isotropic interactions cannot bias density transport. Our work reveals the interplay between interactions and chirality and highlights how correlations engineer exotic quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Topological phases protected by projective space-time inversion symmetry in alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important aspect in categorizing topological phases is whether the system is spinless or spinful, given that these classes exhibit distinct symmetry algebras, leading to disparate topological classifications. By utilizing the projective presentation strategy, the topological phases of spinless (or spinful) systems can be emulated using spinful (or spinless) systems augmented with gauge fields. In this study, we propose to implement the topological phases safeguarded by the unique projective space-time inversion symmetry inherent to spinful models, using synthetic spinless alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms. Employing the separation of orbital and nuclear-spin degrees of freedom, the model is configured as a rectangular tube penetrated by a uniform magnetic flux through each plaquette, which simulates a spinless ladder endowed with projective space-time inversion symmetry satisfying the algebraic properties of a spinful model. For interacting topological phases with interorbital spin-exchange interactions, which also adhere to space-time inversion symmetry, the four-fold degeneracy of edge modes is split into two pairs of edge modes with two-fold degeneracy.We map the complete phase diagram in the end and discover that these interacting topological phases ultimately evolve into distinct charge-density-wave phases via spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature entanglement and coherence in asymmetric bosonic Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature properties of a bosonic Josephson junction composed of N interacting atoms confined by a quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric double-well potential, modeled by the two-site Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We compute numerically the spectral decomposition of the statistical ensemble of states, the thermodynamic and entanglement entropies, the population imbalance, the quantum Fisher information, and the coherence visibility. We analyze their dependence on the system parameters, showing in particular how finite temperature and on-site energy asymmetry affect the entanglement and coherence properties of the system. Moreover, starting from a quantum phase model which accurately describes the system over a wide range of interactions, we develop a reliable description of the strong tunneling regime, where thermal averages may be computed analytically using a modified Boltzmann weight involving an effective temperature. We discuss the possibility of applying this effective description to other models in suitable regimes.</description>

      <title>Variational Approach to the Snake Instability of a Bose-Einstein Condensate Soliton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solitons are striking manifestations of nonlinearity, encountered in diverse physical systems such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In BECs, dark solitons emerge as exact stationary solutions of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. While they can be long-lived in elongated traps, their stability is compromised in higher dimensions due to the snake instability, which leads to the decay of the soliton into vortex structures among other excitations. We investigate the dynamics of a dark soliton in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an anisotropic harmonic trap. Using a variational ansatz that incorporates both the transverse bending of the soliton plane and the emergence of vortices along the nodal line, we derive equations of motion governing the soliton's evolution. This approach allows us to identify stable oscillation modes as well as the growth rates of the unstable perturbations. In particular, we determine the critical trap anisotropy required to suppress the snake instability. Our analytical predictions are in good agreement with full numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of moire quasicrystal patterns in Bose gasses confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the total density wave amplitude exhibit the stage for the emergence of moire quasicrystal patterns, where the pattern formation is closely associated with the momenta of collective modes excited by the weak periodic drive. Through analyzing the radial and angular density wave amplitude, we find that these new collective modes are only coupled radially and cannot be decoupled eventually. The symmetry of quasicrystal patterns can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moire quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Single impurity atom embedded in a dipolar two-soliton molecule as a qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a single impurity atom trapped in a double well (DW) potential created by a dipolar two-soliton molecule in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. By solving the eigenvalue problem for the impurity atom in the DW potential, we find that its ground and first excited states are well separated from higher excited states. This allows it to be approximated by a desirable two-level quantum system. Numerical simulations of the Schr\"odinger equation, governing impurity atom, demonstrate periodic oscillations in the probability of finding the impurity confined either to the ``left" or to the ``right" side of the DW potential. An analytic expression for the coherent oscillations of the population imbalance between the two wells of the DW potential has been derived using the two-mode approximation. Theoretical predictions of the mathematical model are in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations. Potential usage of the developed setup as a physical realization of ``qubit" has been discussed.</description>

Abstract: In these notes, we elucidate some subtle aspects of coherent-state path integrals, focusing on their application to the equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-particle systems. These subtleties emerge when evaluating path integrals in the continuum, either in imaginary time or in Matsubara-frequency space. Our central message is that, when handled with due care, the path integral yields results identical to those obtained from the canonical Hamiltonian approach. We illustrate this through a pedagogical treatment of several paradigmatic systems: the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillators, the single-site Bose-Hubbard and Hubbard models, the weakly-interacting Bose gas with finite-range interactions, and the BCS superconductor with finite-range interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly interacting many-body systems exhibit collective properties that emerge from complex correlations among microscopic degrees of freedom. These cooperative phenomena govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, with relevance ranging from condensed matter physics to quantum field theories describing fundamental aspects of our universe. Understanding such emergent dynamics from first principles remains one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation dynamics following quenches in 2D ferromagnetic quantum Ising systems implemented in an atomic Rydberg array. Our experiments reveal two distinct regimes: In the confined regime, we observe an energy-dependent cluster size, revealing large collective clusters exceeding ten spins. In contrast, the deconfined regime is characterized by kinetically constrained, avalanche-like nucleation dynamics involving the entire system. Our findings establish a new frontier for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays, enabling controlled exploration of non-equilibrium phenomena previously out of reach. Beyond advancing experimental capabilities, they provide fundamental insights into highly correlated processes with implications that reach from quantum magnetism and glassy dynamics to cosmological models of the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04681v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules has long remained a hot topic in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. However, most prior research has focused on diatomic molecules, with relatively scarce exploration of polyatomic molecules. Here we propose a two-step strategy for the formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules. We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetratomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetratomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Localization and Multifractality in Spiral quasiperiodic chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic Aubry Andre lattice arranged along a spiral curve. In this setup, the changing angle of the spiral naturally stretches and compresses the distances between neighboring sites, which in turn modulates the hopping amplitudes.
  The onsite potential itself remains the familiar AA form, but this geometry induced variation in the hopping dramatically changes how the system behaves both in its energy spectrum and in how its states localize.Using inverse participation ratios together with a full multifractal analysis, we find that curvature makes the system localize much more easily, even at relatively small quasiperiodic strengths. It also produces clear windows where the eigenstates become strongly multifractal. This shows that quasiperiodicity and geometry do not act independently rather, they reinforce one another in shaping the wavefunctions. Overall, we observe a smooth evolution of the states from extended, to multifractal, and finally to strongly localized. Our results pave the way for creating tunable quasiperiodic and geometry-driven localization effects in photonic waveguide arrays, ultracold atoms, mechanical metamaterials, and nanoscale platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of solitons in a uniform quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) spin-orbit (SO) coupled self-repulsive binary dipolar and nondipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For a weak SO coupling, in a nondipolar BEC, one can have three types of degenerate solitons: a multi-ring soliton with intrinsic vorticity of angular momentum projection $+1$ or $-1$ in one component and 0 in the other, a circularly-asymmetric soliton and a stripe soliton with stripes in the density. For an intermediate SO couplings, the multi-ring soliton ceases to exist and there appears a square-lattice soliton with a spatially-periodic pattern in density on a square lattice, in addition to the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons. In the presence of a dipolar interaction, with the polarization direction aligned in the quasi-2D plane, only the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons appear.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically characterize the dynamical evolution of time-parity (PT )-symmetric two-level systems with spin-dependent dissipations. If the control parameters of the gap are linearly tuned with time, the dynamical evolution can be characterized with parabolic cylinder equations which can be analytically solved. We find that the asymptotic behaviors of particle probability on the two levels show initial-state-independent redistribution in the slow-tuning-speed limit as long as the system is nonadiabatically driven across exceptional points. Equal distributions appear when the nondissipative Hamiltonian shows gap closing. So long as the nondissipative Hamiltonian displays level anticrossing, the final distribution becomes unbalanced. The ratios between the occupation probabilities are given analytically. These results are confirmed with numerical simulations. The predicted equal distribution phenomenon may be used to identify the closing of the energy gap from anti-crossing between two energy bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed that a soliton resulting from nonlinearity can be pumped across an integer or fractional number of unit cells as a system parameter is slowly varied over a pump period. Nonlinear Thouless pumping is now understood as the flow of instantaneous Wannier functions, ruling out the possibility of pumping a soliton across a nonzero number of unit cells over one cycle when a corresponding Wannier function does not exhibit any flow, i.e., when the corresponding Bloch band that the soliton bifurcates from is topologically trivial. Here we surprisingly find an anomalous nonlinear Thouless pump where the displacement of a soliton over one cycle differs from the Chern number of the Bloch band from which the soliton comes. We develop a general theory showing that this anomalous behavior arises from a transition of a soliton between different Wannier functions by passing through an intersite-soliton (or dipole-soliton) state. Furthermore, we find a nonlinearity-induced integer quantized Thouless pump of a soliton, allowing a soliton to travel across one unit cell during a pump period, even when the corresponding band is topologically trivial. Our results open the door to studying nonlinearity-induced Thouless pumping of solitons.</description>

      <title>Maximal Entanglement and Frozen Information: A Unified Framework for Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are temporal singularities marked by zeros of the Loschmidt echo, yet their underlying quantum-information structure remains elusive. Here, we introduce a momentum-resolved entanglement entropy as a direct probe of DQPTs in translation-invariant free systems. We analytically establish that every critical momentum mode $k^{*}$ associated with a DQPT saturates its entanglement to the maximal value $\ln{2}$, coinciding with the vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. Crucially, we demonstrate that this maximal entanglement universally suppresses information scrambling: a momentum-resolved out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) vanishes identically for all times at $k^{*}$. These three signatures -- Fisher zeros, maximal entanglement, and vanished OTOC -- are proved to be equivalent in both the transverse-field Ising and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models, despite their distinct bipartitions (momentum-pair vs. sublattice). Our results establish a unified, information-theoretic framework for DQPTs, revealing them a points where quantum correlations saturate and information flow halts. This work elevates entanglement and scrambling to central dynamical order parameters, offering a universal perspective on nonequilibrium quantum critically.</description>

      <title>Construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states in the SU($N$) Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.</description>

Abstract: We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $\nu$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.</description>
