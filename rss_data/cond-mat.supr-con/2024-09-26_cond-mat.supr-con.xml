      <title>Charge modulation in the background of depleted superconductivity inside vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BDG) formalism to undertake a microscopic investigation of a vortex lattice in a strongly correlated, type-II, d-wave superconductor (SC) treating strong correlation within Gutzwiller formalism. We demonstrate that in the underdoped region, the vortex core changes from metallic-type to insulating-type in the presence of subdominant charge and bond order, in contrast to Mott-type, when these orders are absent. We have investigated that such subdominant order changes the structure and spectrum of the d-wave vortex in the underdoped region. We have demonstrated the formation of charge and bond modulation at the vortex center by decreasing the doping and reaching an underdoped zone.</description>

      <title>Fundamental nature of the self-field critical current in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to conduct electric current without dissipating energy is a property of superconductors that is used in magnetic systems utilized in healthcare, natural sciences, and ongoing global projects in nuclear fusion and aviation. The highest dissipation-less current is named the critical current, and this is one of the prime practical properties of superconductors (together with the critical current density, Jc). Recently, Goyal et al reported a record high Jc~190 MA/cm2 at 4.2 K in (RE)BCO films, exceeding the highest Jc in the best commercial (RE)BCO wires by a factor of five. Based on the huge potential practical impact of this high Jc, we examined the raw experimental data and found that this high value originates from an error in the conversion of units. The real Jc is 10 times smaller than the reported Jc, consistent with values currently achieved by many manufacturers.</description>

      <title>Tunneling spectra of unconventional quasi-two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluid condensation can fundamentally be different from that predicted by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. In a broad class of low-carrier-density superconductors, such as granular aluminum, doped nitrides, and high-Tc cuprates, tunneling experiments reveal strong rather than weak coupling, as well as a conductance that does not return to that of the normal state upon approaching the critical temperature Tc. Here, we show that this behavior is in quantitative agreement with a tunneling theory that takes into account the large pairing-fluctuation effects that occur in the crossover region from weak-coupling BCS to strong-coupling Bose-Einstein condensation, provided the coherence energy scale rather than the single-particle energy gap is used to evaluate the coupling ratio. We also propose that the tendency toward strong coupling is a generic property of quasi-2D low-carrier-density superconductors.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear diode effect and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in purely two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase diagrams and electronic transport properties of the helical states in purely two-dimensional (2D) Rashba superconductors coupled with in-plane Zeeman fields are studied. The continuum XY action is derived microscopically by integrating out the Gaussian amplitude fluctuation from the effective action. We show that the superfluid stiffness obtained from this procedure is exactly equivalent to the second-order derivative of the mean-field free energy density with respect to Cooper pair momentum, indicating an essential role of the amplitude fluctuation. The vortex core energy is also included in this work, and its effects on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition line are discussed. The theory of nonlinear V-I characteristics in purely 2D superconductors is also revised to incorporate recent developments in the theory of the superconducting diode effect. The main results are as follows. We find that the nonlinear V-I characteristics of the system become nonreciprocal in finite in-plane Zeeman fields. This is reminiscent of the superconducting diode effect in 2D systems, although the critical current is zero in purely 2D superconductors. Furthermore, we find that the bare effective superfluid stiffness along the BKT transition line has a local minimum at a certain temperature, and the nonreciprocity of the V-I characteristics is strongly enhanced around this temperature.</description>

      <title>Non-collapsing electric readout of arbitrary Andreev qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nondemolition protocols use ancilla qubits to identify the fragile quantum state of a qubit without destroying its encoded information, thus playing a crucial role in nondestructive quantum measurements particularly relevant for quantum error correction. However, the multitude of ancilla preparations, information transfers, and ancilla measurements in these protocols create an intrinsic overhead for information processing. Here we consider an Andreev qubit defined in a quantum-dot Josephson junction and show that the intrinsic time-dependent oscillatory supercurrent arising from the quantum interference of the many-body eigenstates of the Andreev qubit, can be used to probe the qubit itself nondestructively and \textit{without} collapsing its quantum state. This nondestructive and non-collapsing readout of arbitrary superposition states of Andreev qubits avoids ancilla qubits altogether and significantly reduces experimental overhead as no repetitive qubit resetting is needed. Our findings should have an unprecedented impact on advancing research and applications involving Andreev dots, thus positioning them as promising qubit contenders for quantum processing and technologies.</description>

      <title>Computational electron-phonon superconductivity: from theoretical physics to material science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for room-temperature superconductors is a major challenge in modern physics. The discovery of copper-oxide superconductors in 1986 brought hope but also revealed complex mechanisms that are difficult to analyze and compute. In contrast, the traditional electron-phonon coupling (EPC) mechanism facilitated the practical realization of superconductivity in metallic hydrogen. Since 2015, the discovery of new hydrogen compounds has shown that EPC can enable room-temperature superconductivity under high pressures, driving extensive research. Advances in computational capabilities, especially exascale computing, now allow for the exploration of millions of materials. This paper reviews newly predicted superconducting systems in 2023-2024, focusing on hydrides, boron-carbon systems, and compounds with nitrogen, carbon, and pure metals. Although many computationally predicted high-Tc superconductors were not experimentally confirmed, some low-temperature superconductors were successfully synthesized. This paper provides a review of these developments and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Mirror-protected Majorana zero modes in $f$-wave multilayer graphene superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental discoveries of superconductivity in chirally-stacked and twisted multilayer graphene, we study models of $f$-wave superconductivity on the honeycomb lattice with arbitrary numbers of layers. These models respect a mirror symmetry that allows classification of the bands by a mirror-projected winding number $\nu_\pm$. For odd numbers of layers, the systems are topologically nontrivial with $\nu_\pm = \pm 1$. Along each mirror-preserving edge in armchair nanoribbons, there are two protected Majorana zero modes. These modes are present even if the sample is finite in both directions, such as in rectangular and hexagonal flakes. Crucially, zero modes can also be confined to vortex cores, which can be created by a magnetic field or localized magnetic impurities and accessed by local scanning probes. Finally, we apply these models to twisted bilayer and trilayer systems, which also feature boundary-projected and vortex-confined zero modes. Since vortices are experimentally accessible, our study suggests that superconducting multilayer graphene systems are promising platforms to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films modulated by e-beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. The observed resistance modifications likely stem from photoreduction induced by X-ray and/or UV radiation emitted during electron beam interactions with the film and substrate.</description>

      <title>Coherence length and quantum geometry in a dilute flat-band superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To explore the influence of quantum-geometric effects on the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor, we adopt a BCS-BEC crossover approach to the multiband pyrochlore-Hubbard model near the critical temperature for superconductivity. Our self-consistent formulation for this three-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called zero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the coherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally, we show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper pairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in the dilute flat-band limit.</description>
