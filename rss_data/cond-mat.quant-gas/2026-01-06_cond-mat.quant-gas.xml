      <title>Tunable chiral spiral phases in a non-Hermitian Ising-Gamma spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of dissipation on the Ising-Gamma model. Through observables such as ground-state energy, order parameters, entanglement entropy, etc., we identify each phase region and provide the global phase diagram of the system. The results show that the region of the spiral phase will continuously expand with the increase of dissipation, gradually squeezing the original paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase regions. Remarkably, unlike the conservative system, the introduction of dissipation will cause two spiral phases with opposite chiralities to emerge simultaneously in the system, which provides a possibility for the manipulation of spiral chirality in cold atomic experiments. Moreover, we reveal the mechanism of the dependence of the transformation between these two spiral phases with distinct chirality on the strength of the relative coefficient of off-diagonal Gamma interactions in the Ising-Gamma model. Since both the relevant order parameters and dissipation can be well controlled within a detectable range, these phenomena can be observed in ultracold atomic experiments.</description>

      <title>Ground State and Collective Modes of Bose-Einstein Condensates in Newtonian and MOND-inspired gravitational potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically study the ground state and collective dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in two traps: a Newtonian potential and a logarithmic potential inspired by Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). In the ground state, the MOND potential supports bound states only in the deep-MOND regime, where the condensate becomes significantly larger than its Newtonian counterpart. The size increases with repulsive coupling parameter $\beta$ in both potentials. A clear scaling law of the size with $\beta^{1/3}$ emerges in the MOND case and is confirmed numerically over a wide parameter range, while for the Newtonian potential no simple scaling law exists as the Thomas-Fermi approximation ceases to be valid. For the dynamics, we derive and solve equations for the monopole collective mode. The larger MOND-bound condensate oscillates at a lower frequency, which scales as $\beta^{-1/3}$ in the strong-interaction limit. These scaling laws provide insights for quantum-simulation experiments aiming to probe modified-gravity scenarios with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Accelerating evaporative cooling of a strongly interacting Fermi gas by tilting the optical trap with a magnetic field gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rapid evaporative cooling scheme for a strongly interacting $^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ Fermi gas in an optical dipole trap. The method uses a magnetic-field-gradient--induced tilt of the trapping potential to accelerate cooling in the unitarity-limited regime. In evaporation based only on lowering the optical trap depth, the unitarity-limited scattering cross section can support runaway cooling; however, the cooling rate slows around $T/T_F \simeq 0.5$, and the runaway behavior is no longer maintained. We improve on this approach by applying a magnetic-field gradient when the gas temperature reaches about half the Fermi temperature. The induced tilt opens an escape channel for energetic atoms while keeping the trap frequencies nearly unchanged. This modification increases the cooling speed and cools the gas below the superfluid transition temperature, reaching $T/T_F = 0.16$ on a timescale of $\sim 25\,\mathrm{ms}$. Our results provide a simple and robust route for rapidly cooling a strongly interacting Fermi gas into the superfluid regime, facilitating studies of the physics of unitary Fermi superfluids.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topological superfluid in a three dimensional optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental advances in realizing artificial spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and non-Hermitian potentials in ultracold atomic system open a new avenue for exploring their significant roles in quantum many-body physics. Here, we investigate a non-Hermitian, two-component Fermi system in a cubic lattice with Rashba SOC and complex-valued interaction arising from two-body loss. We adopt the non-Hermitian mean field theory and map out the phase diagram at zero temperature. The interplay of dissipation and on-site interaction drives a dissipation-induced phase transition from superfluid (SF) to normal phase (N). Notably, for weak interaction strengths, this leads to a reentrance of the superfluid state. The presence of SOC significantly expands the parameter regime for both the normal phase and the metastable superfluid phase(MSF). Whereas, the Zeeman field can drive the system from a conventional superfluid into a topological superfluid phase(TSF), characterized by a nontrivial topological invariant. These results enrich our knowledge of pairing superfluidity in Fermi systems.</description>

      <title>Pair distribution functions of a superfluid spin-1/2 Fermi gas with contact interactions in the linearized time-dependent BCS theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the minimal mean-field theory to use for calculating the pair distribution functions $g_{\sigma\sigma'}(\vec{r},\vec{r}\,')$ of a spatially homogeneous, unpolarized spin-1/2 superfluid Fermi gas is not the ordinary static BCS theory, but the linearized time-dependent BCS theory implemented via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Indeed, the former completely ignores the acoustic excitation branch - the phonons - of the superfluid, while the latter explicitly takes it into account, as well as the quantum fluctuations induced by the broken-pair continuum. Unlike the first, the second theory (i) reflects the effect of these collective excitations on the system's equation of state, including at zero temperature, (ii) allows the function $g_{\uparrow\downarrow}(\vec{r},\vec{r}\,')$ to go at sufficiently large distances strictly below its asymptotic value $(\rho/2)^2$ where $\rho$ is the gas density, as expected according to the quantum hydrodynamics of Landau and Khalatnikov at low temperatures, and (iii) predicts in the function $g_{\uparrow\uparrow}(\vec{r},\vec{r}\,')$ at short distances subdominant contributions $|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|^2\ln|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|$ in 3D and $|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|^2\ln(-\ln|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|)$ in 2D, alongside the dominant contributions $|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|$ in 3D and $|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|^2\ln|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|$ in 2D already present in static BCS theory but with a lower coefficient. This discussion is relevant to the recent theoretical work of Obeso-Jureidini and Romero-Rochin, and to the ongoing experiments on cold atomic gases at ENS and MIT.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation with Rydberg ions in a Penning trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of interacting many-body spin systems is routinely performed with cold trapped ions, and systems with hundreds of spins have been studied in one and two dimensions. In the most common realizations of these platforms, spin degrees of freedom are encoded in low-lying electronic levels, and interactions among the spins are mediated through crystal vibrations. Here we propose a new approach which enables the quantum simulation of two-dimensional spin systems with interaction strengths that are increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems. Our platform makes use of the strong dipolar interactions among electronic Rydberg states and planar confinement provided by a Penning trap. We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions. As a brief illustration of the capabilities of this quantum simulator, we study the entanglement in a frustrated spin system realized by three ions.</description>

      <title>Onsager vortex clusters on a sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Onsager vortex clustered states in a shell-shaped superfluid containing a large number of quantum vortices. In the incompressible limit and at low temperatures, the relevant problem can be boiled down to the statistical mechanics of neutral point vortices confined on a sphere. We analyze rotation free vortex clustered states within the mean field theory in the microcanonical ensemble. We find that the sandwich state, which involves the separating of vortices with opposite circulation and the clustering of vortices with the same circulation around the poles and the equator, is the maximum entropy vortex distribution, subject to zero angular momentum constraint. The dipole momentum vanishes for the sandwich state and the quadrupole tensor serves as an order parameter to characterize the vortex cluster structure. For given finite angular momentum, the equilibrium vortex distribution forms a dipole structure, i.e., vortices with opposite sign are separated and are accumulated around the south and north pole, respectively. The conditions for the onset of clustering, and the exponents associated with the quadrupole moment and the dipole moment as functions of energy, are obtained within the mean field theory. At large energies,
  we obtain asymptotically exact vortex density distributions using the stereographic projection method, giving rise to the parameter bounds for the vortex clustered states. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Impurity immersed in a two-component few-fermion mixture in a one-dimensional harmonic trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional three-component few-fermion mixture confined in a parabolic external trap, where one component contains a single particle acting as an impurity. Focusing on the many-body ground state, we analyze how the interactions between the impurity and the other components influence the system's structure. For fixed interaction strengths within the mixture, we identify a critical interaction strength with the impurity for which the system undergoes a structural transition characterized by a substantial change in its spatial features. We explore this transition from the point of view of correlations and ground-state susceptibility. We remarkably find that this transition exhibits unique universality features not previously observed in other systems, highlighting novel many-body properties existing in multi-component fermionic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quantized vortices under quasi-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is widely used for vortex dynamics, but finite domains with hard walls or confining potentials distort bulk behavior through vortex-image effects or induced flows. Periodic boundaries reduce wall artifacts yet cannot realize finite net vorticity because of topological obstruction, so bulk simulations with non-zero circulation are typically unavailable. Hence, we impose quasi-periodic boundary conditions that keep the superfluid's density periodic while enforcing phase windings consistent with a net prescribed total vorticity. This setting conserves the net number of vortices and enables long-time tracking of vortex trajectories in settings that finite containers cannot capture. This allows us to study vortex depinning and nucleation leading to the creation of K\'arm\'an vortex streets and perfectly periodic vortex arrays. The framework also provides a toy model for studying vortex dynamics in the bulk of neutron stars, free of possible limitations induced by confining potentials.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nesting in Driven Two-Dimensional Quantum Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring the instability of nested Fermi surfaces in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$ and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable many-body systems.</description>
