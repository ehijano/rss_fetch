      <title>Autonomy in the Real-World: Autonomous Trajectory Planning for Asteroid Reconnaissance via Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of an optimization-based autonomous trajectory planning algorithm for the asteroid reconnaissance phase of a deep-space exploration mission. The reconnaissance phase is a low-altitude flyby to collect detailed information around a potential landing site. Although such autonomous deep-space exploration missions have garnered considerable interest recently, state-of-the-practice in trajectory design involves a time-intensive ground-based open-loop process that forward propagates multiple trajectories with a range of initial conditions and parameters to account for uncertainties in spacecraft knowledge and actuation. In this work, we introduce a stochastic trajectory optimization-based approach to generate trajectories that satisfy both the mission and spacecraft safety constraints during the reconnaissance phase of the Deep-space Autonomous Robotic Explorer (DARE) mission concept, which seeks to travel to and explore a near-Earth object autonomously, with minimal ground intervention. We first use the Multi-Spacecraft Concept and Autonomy Tool (MuSCAT) simulation framework to rigorously validate the underlying modeling assumptions for our trajectory planner and then propose a method to transform this stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic one tailored for use with an off-the-shelf nonlinear solver. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithmic approach through extensive numerical experiments and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-practice benchmark used for representative missions.</description>

      <title>An instrument to link global positioning to the Universe -- Observing GNSS satellites with the Australian VLBI array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>

      <title>Torsional Alfven Oscillation in the Regime of Firehose Instability as a Mechanism of Plasma Stratification in a Laboratory Experiment on Modeling a Coronal Arch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compact laboratory stand ``Solar Wind'' (Inst. Appl. Phys. of Russ. Acad. Sci.) forms an arch structure of the coronal loop type, in which the plasma pressure varies from zero to values of the order of and above the magnetic pressure. The arc discharge in each of the bases of the magnetic tube creates a plasma that is characterized by a significantly higher ion temperature along the magnetic field line than across the latter one. In the stationary state (when the ion pressure is below the threshold value for rupture of the system at the top of the loop), the plasma is found to be stratified in the form of a cylindrical layer along the outer wall of the tube or possibly two belts along the upper and lower vaults of the arch. The paper discusses the excitation of a torsional Alfven oscillation in the loop in the regime of firehose instability. In the case of rapid growth (with an increment of the order of an ion cyclotron period), the unstable Alfven oscillation essentially reallocates the particles between the central axis and the tube wall, which manifests itself in the form of the observed cylindrical layer.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Simulation of the 2013 April 11 SEP Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) can pose hazardous radiation risks to both humans in space and spacecraft electronics. Numerical modeling based on first principles offers valuable insights into SEPs, providing synthetic observables for SEPs at any time and location in space. In this work, we present a high-resolution scheme based on integral relations for Poisson brackets to solve the kinetic equation for particle acceleration and transport processes. We implement this scheme within the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), developed at the University of Michigan, to conduct a comprehensive study of solar energetic protons during the 2013 April 11 SEP event. In addition, a shock capturing tool is developed to study the coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock starting from the low solar corona. Multi-point spacecraft observations, including SOHO/ERNE, SDO/AIA, GOES and ACE at Earth, and STEREO-A/B, are used for model-data comparison and validation. New synthetic observables such as white-light images, shock geometry and properties, as well as SEP intensity-time profiles and spectra provide insights for SEP studies. The influences of the mean free path on SEP intensity-time profiles and spectra are also discussed. The results demonstrate: (1) the successful implementation of the Poisson bracket scheme with a self-consistent particle tracker within the SWMF, (2) the capability of capturing the time-evolving shock surface in the SWMF, and (3) the complexity of the mean free path impacts on SEPs. Overall, this study contributes to both scientific research and operational objectives by advancing our understanding of particle behaviors and showing the readiness for more accurate SEP predictions.</description>
