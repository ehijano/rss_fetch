      <title>Modeling Iodine Deficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a four-unit, four-component mathematical model of iodine metabolism and its impact on thyroid hormone levels in the body. We focus on the relationships between iodine (I-), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) through the mixer, thyroid, sensor (pituitary gland), and metabolism. Iodine plays a fundamental role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, as it is essential for the synthesis of T3 and T4, which regulate weight, energy, and other physiological functions. Iodine deficiency, which is one of the most common nutrient deficiencies in the world, can lead to hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by fatigue, weight gain, and cognitive impairments [1].
  Our model tracks the movement of iodine through dietary intake, thyroid absorption, hormone synthesis, feedback regulation via TSH, and deiodization in metabolism. By evaluating different forms of the accounting equation governing these processes, we have concluded three key results. 1) Iodide availability directly impacts levels of T3 and T4 production, with both component flow rates declining at day 70 in a mildly diseased state, and day 60 in a severely diseased state. 2) TSH is an early diagnostic indicator of thyroid issues, with TSH levels rising to magnitudes of 25x in just ten days, nearly six times quicker than other biological indicators. 3) There is a 5 day difference in iodine storage depletion between mild and severe iodide deficiency. Understanding these results quantitatively provides insights into thyroid disorders and informs strategies for managing iodine deficiency on both individual and public health levels.</description>

      <title>Controlling tissue size by active fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03126</link>

Abstract: Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We develop a framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.</description>

      <title>A model for boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tissue deformations during morphogenesis can be active, driven by internal processes, or passive, resulting from stresses applied at their boundaries. Here, we introduce the Drosophila hindgut primordium as a model for studying boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis. We characterize its deformations and show that its complex shape changes can be a passive consequence of the deformations of the active regions of the embryo that surround it. First, we find an intermediate characteristic triangular shape in the 3D deformations of the hindgut. We construct a minimal model of the hindgut primordium as an elastic ring deformed by active midgut invagination and germ band extension on an ellipsoidal surface, which robustly captures the symmetry-breaking into this triangular shape. We then quantify the 3D kinematics of the tissue by a set of contours and discover that the hindgut deforms in two stages: an initial translation on the curved embryo surface followed by a rapid breaking of shape symmetry. We extend our model to show that the contour kinematics in both stages are consistent with our passive picture. Our results suggest that the role of in-plane deformations during hindgut morphogenesis is to translate the tissue to a region with anisotropic embryonic curvature and show that uniform boundary conditions are sufficient to generate the observed nonuniform shape change. Our work thus provides a possible explanation for the various characteristic shapes of blastopore-equivalents in different organisms and a framework for the mechanical emergence of global morphologies in complex developmental systems.</description>
