      <title>Double Traversals in Optimal Picker Routes for Warehouses with Multiple Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Picker Routing Problem is a variation of the Rectilinear Traveling Salesman Problem that involves finding the optimal tour of a warehouse that collects all the required items on a given pick list. It has been proven that for a rectangular warehouse with only two cross-aisles, traversing an aisle twice is not required for an optimal tour; however, instances exist where this is needed for warehouses with more than two cross-aisles. In this paper, we define categories of double traversals in the Rectilinear Traveling Salesman Problem and prove that some of these are not required in a minimal tour. This is then applied to the Picker Routing Problem for generalized rectangular warehouses of any size. These results are then used to show that some vertices can be ignored when constructing a tour subgraph, and two out of the six vertical edge configurations considered in existing algorithms are not required. Finally, it is demonstrated that the horizontal edges of a minimal tour subgraph determine the vertical edge configurations, a result that could lead to practical improvement to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning to Price with Resource Constraints: From Full Information to Machine-Learned Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing problem with knapsack, addressing the challenge of balancing exploration and exploitation under resource constraints. We introduce three algorithms tailored to different informational settings: a Boundary Attracted Re-solve Method for full information, an online learning algorithm for scenarios with no prior information, and an estimate-then-select re-solve algorithm that leverages machine-learned informed prices with known upper bound of estimation errors. The Boundary Attracted Re-solve Method achieves logarithmic regret without requiring the non-degeneracy condition, while the online learning algorithm attains an optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our estimate-then-select approach bridges the gap between these settings, providing improved regret bounds when reliable offline data is available. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms across various scenarios. This work advances the understanding of online resource allocation and dynamic pricing, offering practical solutions adaptable to different informational structures.</description>

      <title>Constrained Fuel and Time Optimal 6DOF Powered Descent Guidance Using Indirect Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powered descent guidance (PDG) problems subject to six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) dynamics allow for enforcement of practical attitude constraints. However, numerical solutions to 6DOF PDG problems are challenging due to fast rotational dynamics coupled with translational dynamics, and the presence of highly nonlinear state/control path inequality constraints. In this work, constrained fuel- and time-optimal 6DOF PDG problems are solved leveraging a regularized indirect method, subject to inequality constraints on the thrust magnitude, thruster gimbal angle, rocket tilt angle, glideslope angle, and angular velocity magnitude. To overcome the challenges associated with solving the resulting multipoint boundary-value problems (MPBVPs), the state-only path inequality constraints (SOPICs) are enforced through an interior penalty function method, which embeds the resulting MPBVPs into a multi-parameter smooth neighboring families of two-point BVPs. Extremal solutions are obtained using an indirect multiple-shooting solution method with numerical continuation. Moreover, an empirical relation is derived for the directly-adjoined Lagrange multipliers associated with SOPICs. The fuel- and time-optimal trajectories are compared against solutions of DIDO -- a capable pseudospectral-based software for solving practical constrained optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Benders decomposition for the large-scale probabilistic set covering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a probabilistic set covering problem (PSCP) in which each 0-1 row of the constraint matrix is random with a finite discrete distribution, and the objective is to minimize the total cost of the selected columns such that each row is covered with a prespecified probability. We develop an effective decomposition algorithm for the PSCP based on the Benders reformulation of a standard mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation. The proposed Benders decomposition (BD) algorithm enjoys two key advantages: (i) the number of variables in the underlying Benders reformulation is equal to the number of columns but independent of the number of scenarios of the random data; and (ii) the Benders feasibility cuts can be separated by an efficient polynomial-time algorithm, which makes it particularly suitable for solving large-scale PSCPs. We enhance the BD algorithm by using initial cuts to strengthen the relaxed master problem, implementing an effective heuristic procedure to find high-quality feasible solutions, and adding mixed integer rounding enhanced Benders feasibility cuts to tighten the problem formulation. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed BD algorithm over a state-of-the-art MIP solver. Moreover, the proposed BD algorithm can efficiently identify optimal solutions for instances with up to 500 rows, 5000 columns, and 2000 scenarios of the random rows.</description>

      <title>Optimal Preconditioning for Online Quadratic Cone Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order conic optimization solvers are sensitive to problem conditioning and typically perform poorly in the face of ill-conditioned problem data. To mitigate this, we propose an approach to preconditioning for a class of quadratic cone programs (QCPs), i.e., conic optimization problems with a quadratic objective function, wherein the objective function is strongly convex and possesses a certain structure. This approach lends itself to factorization-free, customizable, first-order conic optimization for online applications wherein the solver is called repeatedly to solve problems of the same size/structure, but with changing problem data. One of the steps in the proposed preconditioning procedure is to scale the objective function: in addition to deriving an analytical expression for the optimal objective function scaling factor, we establish the relationship between the objective function scaling factor and the primal-dual step-size ratio for a first-order method, the proportional-integral projected gradient method (PIPG), which applies to the general class of QCPs, including quadratic programs (QPs), second-order cone programs (SOCPs), and semidefinite programs (SDPs). We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a numerical nonconvex trajectory optimization example, using sequential conic optimization (SeCO).</description>

      <title>Leveraging Christoffel-Darboux Kernels to Strengthen Moment-SOS Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Moment-Sum Of Squares hierarchy allows to approximate a global minimum of a polynomial optimization problem through semidefinite relaxations of increasing size. However, for many optimization instances, solving higher order relaxations becomes impractical or even impossible due to the substantial computational demands they impose. To address this, existing methods often exploit intrinsic problem properties, such as symmetries or sparsity. Here, we present a complementary approach, which enhances the accuracy of computationally more efficient low-order relaxations by leveraging Christoffel-Darboux kernels. Such strengthened relaxations often yield significantly improved bounds or even facilitate minimizer extraction. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach on several classes of important quadratically constrained quadratic Programs.</description>

      <title>Models Parametric Analysis via Adaptive Kernel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any applied mathematical model contains parameters. The paper proposes to use kernel learning for the parametric analysis of the model. The approach consists in setting a distribution on the parameter space, obtaining a finite training sample from this distribution, solving the problem for each parameter value from this sample, and constructing a kernel approximation of the parametric dependence on the entire set of parameter values. The kernel approximation is obtained by minimizing the approximation error on the training sample and adjusting kernel parameters (width) on the same or another independent sample of parameters. This approach to learning complex dependencies is called kernel learning (or kernel SVM). Traditionally, kernel learning is considered in the so-called Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) with a fixed kernel. The novelty of our approach is that we consider the kernel learning in a broad subspace of square-integrable functions with a corresponding L_2-norm regularization. This subspace contains linear combinations of kernel functions with kernels of different shapes at different data points. The approach essentially uses a derived analytical representation of the L2-norm for kernel functions. Thus the approach substantially extends the flexibility of the traditional kernel SVM for account of the number of adjusted parameters and minimization of the training error not only over weights of kernels but also over their shapes. The important issue of selecting the optimal regularization parameter is resolved by minimizing the test error over this parameter. Numerical illustrations are provided.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Stochastic Dominance Constraints in Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution examines optimization problems that involve stochastic dominance constraints. These problems have uncountably many constraints. We develop methods to solve the optimization problem by reducing the constraints to a finite set of test points needed to verify stochastic dominance. This improves both theoretical understanding and computational efficiency. Our approach introduces two formulations of stochastic dominance$\unicode{x2013}$one employs expectation operators and another based on risk measures$\unicode{x2013}$allowing for efficient verification processes. Additionally, we develop an optimization framework incorporating these stochastic dominance constraints. Numerical results validate the robustness of our method, showcasing its effectiveness for solving higher-order stochastic dominance problems, with applications to fields such as portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Operation and Control of a Multi-Stack Alkaline Water Electrolysis System with Shared Gas Separators and Lye Circulation: A Model-Based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An emerging approach for large-scale hydrogen production using renewable energy is to integrate multiple alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) stacks into a single balance of plant (BoP) system, sharing components such as gas-lye separation and lye circulation. This configuration, termed the $N$-in-1 AWE system, packs $N$ stacks into a modular system, reducing land requirements, the complexity of plant topology, and overall capital costs. However, the coupling of these stacks through the shared BoP introduces challenges in dynamic operation under varying energy inputs, making their performance unclear compared to traditional 1-in-1 systems. To address this, we develop a state-space model of the $N$-in-1 AWE system, capturing the dynamic behaviors of lye circulation, temperature, and HTO impurity, and their impact on energy conversion efficiency. We then propose a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) to coordinately optimize inter-stack electrolytic current distribution, lye flow, and cooling, enabling the system to dynamically track varying load commands while maximizing efficiency, stabilizing temperature, and limiting HTO impurity accumulation. Simulation studies on a 4,000 Nm$^3$/h-rated 4-in-1 system verify the proposed controller under dynamic operation. Comparison with 4 independent 1-in-1 systems reveals that, with proper control, the $N$-in-1 configuration offers comparable flexibility in accommodating real-world wind power inputs. The average differences in the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for load-tracking and stack temperature stabilization, and specific energy consumption are below 0.014 MW, 2.356 K, and 0.003 kWh/Nm$^3$.</description>

      <title>Improved algorithms and novel applications of the FrankWolfe.jl library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithms have emerged as an essential class of methods for constrained optimization, especially on large-scale problems. In this paper, we summarize the algorithmic design choices and progress made in the last years of the development of FrankWolfe.jl, a Julia package gathering high-performance implementations of state-of-the-art FW variants. We review key use cases of the library in the recent literature, which match its original dual purpose: first, becoming the de-facto toolbox for practitioners applying FW methods to their problem, and second, offering a modular ecosystem to algorithm designers who experiment with their own variants and implementations of algorithmic blocks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of several FW variants on important problem classes in several experiments, which we curated in a separate repository for continuous benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse Flow Decomposition Methods for RNA Multi-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decomposing a flow on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) into a weighted sum of a small number of paths is an essential task in operations research and bioinformatics. This problem, referred to as Sparse Flow Decomposition (SFD), has gained significant interest, in particular for its application in RNA transcript multi-assembly, the identification of the multiple transcripts corresponding to a given gene and their relative abundance. Several recent approaches cast SFD variants as integer optimization problems, motivated by the NP-hardness of the formulations they consider. We propose an alternative formulation of SFD as a fitting problem on the conic hull of the flow polytope. By reformulating the problem on the flow polytope for compactness and solving it using specific variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, we obtain a method converging rapidly to the minimizer of the chosen loss function while producing a parsimonious decomposition. Our approach subsumes previous formulations of SFD with exact and inexact flows and can model different priors on the error distributions. Computational experiments show that our method outperforms recent integer optimization approaches in runtime, but is also highly competitive in terms of reconstruction of the underlying transcripts, despite not explicitly minimizing the solution cardinality.</description>

      <title>Safe adaptive NMPC using ellipsoidal tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computationally efficient nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm is proposed for safe learning-based control with a system model represented by an affine (unknown) combination of basis functions and subject to additive set-bounded disturbances. The proposed algorithm employs successive linearization around predicted trajectories and accounts for the uncertain components of the predicted state due to linearization, model errors and disturbances using ellipsoidal sets centered on the predicted nominal state trajectory. An ellipsoidal tube-based approach ensures satisfaction of constraints on control variables and model states. Feasibility is ensured using local bounds on linearization errors and a procedure based on a backtracking line search. We show that the ellipsoidal embedding of the predicted uncertainty scales favourably with system dimensions, and we illustrate this using numerical experiments. The approach is combined with a set membership parameter estimation strategy. The resulting algorithm is recursively feasible and provides closed loop stability and performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Predictor-Feedback Stabilization of Globally Lipschitz Nonlinear Systems with State and Input Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a switched nonlinear predictor-feedback control law to achieve global asymptotic stabilization for nonlinear systems with arbitrarily long input delay, under state quantization. The proposed design generalizes the nonlinear predictor-feedback framework by incorporating quantized measurements of both the plant and actuator states into the predictor state formulation. Due to the mismatch between the (inapplicable) exact predictor state and the predictor state constructed in the presence of state quantization, a global stabilization result is possible under a global Lipschitzness assumption on the vector field, as well as under the assumption of existence of a globally Lipschitz, nominal feedback law that achieves global exponential stability of the delay and quantization-free system. To address the constraints imposed by quantization, a dynamic switching strategy is constructed, adjusting the quantizer's tunable parameter in a piecewise constant manner-initially increasing the quantization range, to capture potentially large system states and subsequently refining the precision to reduce quantization error. The global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is established through solutions estimates derived using backstepping transformations, combined with small-gain and input-to-state stability arguments. We also extend our approach to the case of input quantization.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the problem of groundwater trading, capturing the emergent groundwater market setups among stakeholders in a given groundwater basin. The agents optimize their production, taking into account their available water rights, the requisite water consumption, and the opportunity to trade water among themselves. We study the resulting Nash equilibrium, providing a full characterization of the 1-period setting and initial results about the features of the multi-period game driven by the ability of agents to bank their water rights in order to smooth out the intertemporal shocks.</description>

      <title>The Wasserstein Space of Stochastic Processes in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers from different areas have independently defined extensions of the usual weak convergence of laws of stochastic processes with the goal of adequately accounting for the flow of information. Natural approaches are convergence of the Aldous--Knight prediction process, Hellwig's information topology, convergence in adapted distribution in the sense of Hoover--Keisler and the weak topology induced by optimal stopping problems. The first main contribution of this article is that on continuous processes with natural filtrations there exists a canonical adapted weak topology which can be defined by all of these approaches; moreover, the adapted weak topology is metrized by a suitable adapted Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{AW}$.
  While the set of processes with natural filtrations is not complete, we establish that its completion consists precisely of the space ${\rm FP}$ of stochastic processes with general filtrations. We also show that $({\rm FP}, \mathcal{AW})$ exhibits several desirable properties. Specifically, it is Polish, martingales form a closed subset and approximation results such as Donsker's theorem extend to $\mathcal{AW}$.</description>

      <title>When GNNs meet symmetry in ILPs: an orbit-based feature augmentation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common characteristic in integer linear programs (ILPs) is symmetry, allowing variables to be permuted without altering the underlying problem structure. Recently, GNNs have emerged as a promising approach for solving ILPs. However, a significant challenge arises when applying GNNs to ILPs with symmetry: classic GNN architectures struggle to differentiate between symmetric variables, which limits their predictive accuracy. In this work, we investigate the properties of permutation equivariance and invariance in GNNs, particularly in relation to the inherent symmetry of ILP formulations. We reveal that the interaction between these two factors contributes to the difficulty of distinguishing between symmetric variables. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of feature augmentation and propose several guiding principles for constructing augmented features. Building on these principles, we develop an orbit-based augmentation scheme that first groups symmetric variables and then samples augmented features for each group from a discrete uniform distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly enhances both training efficiency and predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment under Mutual Strategy Influence among Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In financial markets, agents often mutually influence each other's investment strategies and adjust their strategies to align with others. However, there is limited quantitative study of agents' investment strategies in such scenarios. In this work, we formulate the optimal investment differential game problem to study the mutual influence among agents. We derive the analytical solutions for agents' optimal strategies and propose a fast algorithm to find approximate solutions with low computational complexity. We theoretically analyze the impact of mutual influence on agents' optimal strategies and terminal wealth. When the mutual influence is strong and approaches infinity, we show that agents' optimal strategies converge to the asymptotic strategy. Furthermore, in general cases, we prove that agents' optimal strategies are linear combinations of the asymptotic strategy and their rational strategies without others' influence. We validate the performance of the fast algorithm and verify the correctness of our analysis using numerical experiments. This work is crucial to comprehend mutual influence among agents and design effective mechanisms to guide their strategies in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Feature-based Evolutionary Diversity Optimization of Discriminating Instances for Chance-constrained Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithm selection is crucial in the field of optimization, as no single algorithm performs perfectly across all types of optimization problems. Finding the best algorithm among a given set of algorithms for a given problem requires a detailed analysis of the problem's features. To do so, it is important to have a diverse set of benchmarking instances highlighting the difference in algorithms' performance. In this paper, we evolve diverse benchmarking instances for chance-constrained optimization problems that contain stochastic components characterized by their expected values and variances. These instances clearly differentiate the performance of two given algorithms, meaning they are easy to solve by one algorithm and hard to solve by the other. We introduce a $(\mu+1)~EA$ for feature-based diversity optimization to evolve such differentiating instances. We study the chance-constrained maximum coverage problem with stochastic weights on the vertices as an example of chance-constrained optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully generates diverse instances based on different features while effectively distinguishing the performance between a pair of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Joint Infrastructure Planning and Order Assignment for On-Demand Food-Delivery Services with Coordinated Drones and Human Couriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal infrastructure planning and order assignment problem of an on-demand food-delivery platform with a mixed fleet of drones and human couriers. The platform has two delivery modes: (a) ground delivery and (b) drone-assisted delivery (i.e., air delivery). In ground delivery, couriers directly collect and transport orders from restaurants to destinations. For air delivery, the delivery process involves three legs: initially, a human courier picks up the order from the restaurant and transports it to a nearby launchpad, where personnel load the orders onto drones and replace batteries as needed. The loaded drone then transports the order from the launchpad to a kiosk, where another courier retrieves the order from the kiosk for final delivery. The platform must determine the optimal locations for launchpads and kiosks within a transportation network, and devise an order assignment strategy that allocates food-delivery orders between ground and air delivery considering the bundling probabilities of ground deliveries and the waiting times at launchpads and kiosks. We formulate the platform's problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and develop a novel neural network-assisted optimization method to obtain high-quality solutions. A case study in Hong Kong validates our model and algorithm, revealing that drone delivery reduces operational costs, minimizes courier fleet size, and increases order bundling opportunities. We also find that the expansion of air delivery services may entail larger delivery times due to the trade-off between the travel time savings induced by the faster air delivery and the associated detours incurred by intermodal transfer and extra waiting times at launchpads and kiosks, which crucially depends on the distance of the orders and the sequence of activating long-distance air delivery routes versus short-distance ones.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Optimization Methods for Training DL Models: Theoretical Perspective on Convergence and Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As data sets grow in size and complexity, it is becoming more difficult to pull useful features from them using hand-crafted feature extractors. For this reason, deep learning (DL) frameworks are now widely popular. The Holy Grail of DL and one of the most mysterious challenges in all of modern ML is to develop a fundamental understanding of DL optimization and generalization. While numerous optimization techniques have been introduced in the literature to navigate the exploration of the highly non-convex DL optimization landscape, many survey papers reviewing them primarily focus on summarizing these methodologies, often overlooking the critical theoretical analyses of these methods. In this paper, we provide an extensive summary of the theoretical foundations of optimization methods in DL, including presenting various methodologies, their convergence analyses, and generalization abilities. This paper not only includes theoretical analysis of popular generic gradient-based first-order and second-order methods, but it also covers the analysis of the optimization techniques adapting to the properties of the DL loss landscape and explicitly encouraging the discovery of well-generalizing optimal points. Additionally, we extend our discussion to distributed optimization methods that facilitate parallel computations, including both centralized and decentralized approaches. We provide both convex and non-convex analysis for the optimization algorithms considered in this survey paper. Finally, this paper aims to serve as a comprehensive theoretical handbook on optimization methods for DL, offering insights and understanding to both novice and seasoned researchers in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning problem is a complex optimization problem in the field of robotics. In this paper, we investigate the possible utilization of this problem in benchmarking global optimization methods. We devise a problem instance generator and pick 56 representative instances, which we compare to established benchmarking suits through Exploratory Landscape Analysis to show their uniqueness. For the computational comparison, we select twelve well-performing global optimization techniques from both subfields of stochastic algorithms (evolutionary computation methods) and deterministic algorithms (Dividing RECTangles, or DIRECT-type methods). The experiments were conducted in settings with varying dimensionality and computational budgets. The results were analyzed through several criteria (number of best-found solutions, mean relative error, Friedman ranks) and utilized established statistical tests. The best-ranking methods for the UAV problems were almost universally the top-performing evolutionary techniques from recent competitions on numerical optimization at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Congress on Evolutionary Computation. Lastly, we discussed the variable dimension characteristics of the studied UAV problems that remain still largely under-investigated.</description>

      <title>Exact Two-Step Benders Decomposition for the Time Window Assignment Traveling Salesperson Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02849v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-day delivery logistics services are redefining the industry by increasingly focusing on customer service. A challenge each logistics service provider faces is to jointly optimize time window assignment and vehicle routing for such next-day delivery services. To do so in a cost-efficient and customer-centric fashion, real-life uncertainty such as stochastic travel times need to be incorporated in the optimization process. This paper focuses on the canonical optimization problem within this context; the Time Window Assignment Traveling Salesperson Problem with Stochastic Travel Times (TWATSP-ST). It belongs to the class of two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming problems with continuous recourse. We introduce Two-Step Benders Decomposition with Scenario Clustering (TBDS) as an exact solution methodology for solving such stochastic programs. The method utilizes a new two-step decomposition along the binary and continuous first-stage decisions and introduces a new scenario-retention strategy that combines and generalizes state-of-the-art Benders approaches and scenario-clustering techniques. Extensive experiments show that TBDS is superior to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. It solves TWATSP-ST instances with up to 25 customers to optimality. It provides better lower and upper bounds that lead to faster convergence than existing state-of-the-art methods. We use TBDS to analyze the structure of the optimal solutions. By increasing routing costs only slightly, customer service can be improved tremendously, driven by smartly alternating between high- and low-variance travel arcs to reduce the impact of delay propagation throughout the executed vehicle route.</description>

      <title>A second-order sequential optimality condition for nonlinear second-order cone programming problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last two decades, the sequential optimality conditions, which do not require constraint qualifications and allow improvement on the convergence assumptions of algorithms, had been considered in the literature. It includes the work by Andreani et al. (2017), with a sequential optimality condition for nonlinear programming, that uses the second-order information of the problem. More recently, Fukuda et al. (2023) analyzed the conditions that use second-order information, in particular for nonlinear second-order cone programming problems (SOCP). However, such optimality conditions were not defined explicitly. In this paper, we propose an explicit definition of approximate-Karush-Kuhn-Tucker 2 (AKKT2) and complementary-AKKT2 (CAKKT2) conditions for SOCPs. We prove that the proposed AKKT2/CAKKT2 conditions are satisfied at local optimal points of the SOCP without any constraint qualification. We also present two algorithms that are based on augmented Lagrangian and sequential quadratic programming methods and show their global convergence to points satisfying the proposed conditions.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement-learning-based Algorithms for Optimization Problems and Applications to Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a new iterative algorithm, called REINFORCE-OPT, for solving a general type of optimization problems. This algorithm parameterizes the solution search rule and iteratively updates the parameter using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm resembling REINFORCE. To gain a deeper understanding of the RL-based methods, we show that REINFORCE-OPT essentially solves a stochastic version of the given optimization problem, and that under standard assumptions, the searching rule parameter almost surely converges to a locally optimal value. Experiments show that REINFORCE-OPT outperforms other optimization methods such as gradient descent, the genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization, via its ability to escape from locally optimal solutions and its robustness to the choice of initial values. With rigorous derivations, we formally introduce the use of reinforcement learning to deal with inverse problems. By choosing specific probability models for the action-selection rule, we can also connect our approach to the conventional methods of Tikhonov regularization and iterative regularization. We take non-linear integral equations and parameter-identification problems in partial differential equations as examples to show how reinforcement learning can be applied in solving non-linear inverse problems. The numerical experiments highlight the strong performance of REINFORCE-OPT, as well as its ability to quantify uncertainty in error estimates and identify multiple solutions for ill-posed inverse problems that lack solution stability and uniqueness.</description>

A least square temporal difference method is applied to compute the value function for the critic. The policy gradient method is implemented as policy improvement for the actor. Our key contribution lies in establishing a linear rate of convergence for our proposed actor-critic flow. Theoretical findings are further validated through numerical examples, showing the efficacy of our approach in practical applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present GSSN, a globalized SCD semismooth* Newton method for solving nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems. The global convergence properties of the method are ensured by the proximal gradient method, whereas locally superlinear convergence is established via the SCD semismooth* Newton method under quite weak assumptions. The Newton direction is based on the SC (subspace containing) derivative of the subdifferential mapping and can be computed by the (approximate) solution of an equality-constrained quadratic program. Special attention is given to the efficient numerical implementation of the overall method.</description>

      <title>Robust Microgrid Dispatch with Real-Time Energy Sharing and Endogenous Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rising adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), microgrid dispatch is facing new challenges: DER owners are independent stakeholders seeking to maximize their individual profits rather than being controlled centrally; and the dispatch of renewable generators may affect the microgrid's exposure to uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-stage robust microgrid dispatch model with real-time energy sharing and endogenous uncertainty. In the day-ahead stage, the connection/disconnection of renewable generators is optimized, which influences the size and dimension of the uncertainty set. As a result, the uncertainty set is endogenously given. In addition, non-anticipative operational bounds for energy storage (ES) are derived to enable the online operation of ES in real-time. In the real-time stage, DER owners (consumers and prosumers) share energy with each other via a proposed energy sharing mechanism, which forms a generalized Nash game. To solve the robust microgrid dispatch model, we develop an equivalent optimization model to compute the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. Based on this, a projection-based column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;CG) method is proposed to handle the endogenous uncertainty. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model and method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new convergence rates for a generalized version of stochastic Nesterov acceleration under interpolation conditions. Unlike previous analyses, our approach accelerates any stochastic gradient method which makes sufficient progress in expectation. The proof, which proceeds using the estimating sequences framework, applies to both convex and strongly convex functions and is easily specialized to accelerated SGD under the strong growth condition. In this special case, our analysis reduces the dependence on the strong growth constant from $\rho$ to $\sqrt{\rho}$ as compared to prior work. This improvement is comparable to a square-root of the condition number in the worst case and address criticism that guarantees for stochastic acceleration could be worse than those for SGD.</description>

      <title>Approximation of shape optimization problems with non-smooth PDE constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a shape optimization problem governed by a non-smooth PDE, i.e., the nonlinearity in the state equation is not necessarily differentiable. We follow the functional variational approach of [40] where the set of admissible shapes is parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. This methodology allows for both boundary and topological variations. It has the advantage that one can rewrite the shape optimization problem as a control problem in a function space. To overcome the lack of convexity of the set of admissible controls, we provide an essential density property. This permits us to show that each parametrization associated to the optimal shape is the limit of global optima of non-smooth distributed optimal control problems. The admissible set of the approximating minimization problems is a convex subset of a Hilbert space of functions. Moreover, its structure is such that one can derive strong stationary optimality conditions [6]. The present manuscript provides the basis for the investigations from [5], where necessary conditions in form of an optimality system have been recently established.</description>

      <title>Globally-Constrained Decentralized Optimization with Variable Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many realistic decision-making problems in networked scenarios, such as formation control and collaborative task offloading, often involve complicatedly entangled local decisions, which, however, have not been sufficiently investigated yet. Motivated by this, we study a class of decentralized optimization problems with a variable coupling structure that is new to the literature. Specifically, we consider a network of nodes collaborating to minimize a global objective subject to a collection of global inequality and equality constraints, which are formed by the local objective and constraint functions of the nodes. On top of that, we allow such local functions of each node to depend on not only its own decision variable but the decisions of its neighbors as well. To address this problem, we propose a decentralized projected primal-dual algorithm. It first incorporates a virtual-queue technique with a primal-dual-primal scheme, and then linearizes the non-separable objective and constraint functions to enable decentralized implementation. Under mild conditions, we derive $O(1/k)$ convergence rates for both objective error and constraint violations. Finally, two numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results and illustrate the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A PINN approach for the online identification and control of unknown PDEs</title>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized solving differential equations by integrating physical laws into neural networks training. This paper explores PINNs for open-loop optimal control problems (OCPs) with incomplete information, such as sparse initial and boundary data and partially unknown system parameters. We derive optimality conditions from the Lagrangian multipliers and use PINNs to predict the state, adjoint, and control variables. In contrast with previous methods, our approach integrates these elements into a single neural network and addresses scenarios with consistently limited data. In addition, we address the study of partially unknown equations identifying underlying parameters online by searching for the optimal solution recurring to a 2-in-series architecture of PINNs, in which scattered data of the uncontrolled solution is used. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method even in scenarios characterized by a considerable lack of information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes various variational properties of parametrized versions of two convexity-preserving constructs that were recently introduced in the literature: the proximal composition of a function and a linear operator, and the integral proximal mixture of arbitrary families of functions and linear operators. We study in particular convexity, Legendre conjugacy, differentiability, Moreau envelopes, coercivity, minimizers, recession functions, and perspective functions of these constructs, as well as their asymptotic behavior as the parameter varies. The special case of the proximal expectation of a family of functions is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Gradient correlation is a key ingredient to accelerate SGD with momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirically, it has been observed that adding momentum to Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) accelerates the convergence of the algorithm. However, the literature has been rather pessimistic, even in the case of convex functions, about the possibility of theoretically proving this observation. We investigate the possibility of obtaining accelerated convergence of the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (SNAG), a momentum-based version of SGD, when minimizing a sum of functions in a convex setting. We demonstrate that the average correlation between gradients allows to verify the strong growth condition, which is the key ingredient to obtain acceleration with SNAG. Numerical experiments, both in linear regression and deep neural network optimization, confirm in practice our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Flexibility in Power Systems by Maximizing the Region of Manageable Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing need to hedge against load and generation uncertainty in the operation of power grids, we propose flexibility maximization during operation.
  We consider flexibility explicitly as the amount of uncertainty that can be handled while still ensuring nominal grid operation in the worst-case. We apply the proposed flexibility optimization in the context of a DC flow approximation. By using a corresponding parameterization, we can find the maximal range of uncertainty and a range for the manageable power transfer between two parts of a network subject to uncertainty.
  We formulate the corresponding optimization problem as an (existence-constrained) semi-infinite optimization problem and specialize an existing algorithm for its solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an approximate controllability problem for the continuity equation and its application to constructing transport maps with normalizing flows. Specifically, we construct time-dependent controls $\theta=(w, a, b)$ in the vector field $x\mapsto w(a^\top x + b)_+$ to approximately transport a known base density $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$ to a target density $\rho_*$. The approximation error is measured in relative entropy, and $\theta$ are constructed piecewise constant, with bounds on the number of switches being provided. Our main result relies on an assumption on the relative tail decay of $\rho_*$ and $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$, and provides hints on characterizing the reachable space of the continuity equation in relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Fully Adaptive Zeroth-Order Method for Minimizing Functions with Compressible Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive zeroth-order method for minimizing differentiable functions with $L$-Lipschitz continuous gradients. The method is designed to take advantage of the eventual compressibility of the gradient of the objective function, but it does not require knowledge of the approximate sparsity level $s$ or the Lipschitz constant $L$ of the gradient. We show that the new method performs no more than $O\left(n^{2}\epsilon^{-2}\right)$ function evaluations to find an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of an objective function with $n$ variables. Assuming additionally that the gradients of the objective function are compressible, we obtain an improved complexity bound of $O\left(s\log\left(n\right)\epsilon^{-2}\right)$ function evaluations, which holds with high probability. Preliminary numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method and demonstrate that it can significantly outperform its non-adaptive counterpart.</description>

      <title>On the Almost Sure Convergence of the Stochastic Three Points Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic three points (STP) algorithm is a derivative-free optimization technique designed for unconstrained optimization problems in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we analyze this algorithm for three classes of functions: smooth functions that may lack convexity, smooth convex functions, and smooth functions that are strongly convex. Our work provides the first almost sure convergence results of the STP algorithm, alongside some convergence results in expectation. For the class of smooth functions, we establish that the best gradient iterate of the STP algorithm converges almost surely to zero at a rate arbitrarily close to $o(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Furthermore, within the same class of functions, we establish both almost sure convergence and convergence in expectation of the final gradient iterate towards zero. For the class of smooth convex functions, we establish that $f(\theta^T)$ converges to $\inf_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(\theta)$ almost surely at a rate arbitrarily close to $o(\frac{1}{T})$, and in expectation at a rate of $O(\frac{d}{T})$ where $d$ is the dimension of the space. Finally, for the class of smooth functions that are strongly convex, we establish that when step sizes are obtained by approximating the directional derivatives of the function, $f(\theta^T)$ converges to $\inf_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(\theta)$ in expectation at a rate of $O((1-\frac{\mu}{dL})^T)$, and almost surely at a rate arbitrarily close to $o((1-\frac{\mu}{dL})^T)$, where $\mu$ and $L$ are the strong convexity and smoothness parameters of the function.</description>

      <title>Coverage-Validity-Aware Algorithmic Recourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic recourse emerges as a prominent technique to promote the explainability, transparency, and ethics of machine learning models. Existing algorithmic recourse approaches often assume an invariant predictive model; however, the predictive model is usually updated upon the arrival of new data. Thus, a recourse that is valid respective to the present model may become invalid for the future model. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework to generate a model-agnostic recourse that exhibits robustness to model shifts. Our framework first builds a coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate of the nonlinear (black-box) model; then, the recourse is generated with respect to the linear surrogate. We establish a theoretical connection between our coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate and the minimax probability machines (MPM). We then prove that by prescribing different covariance robustness, the proposed framework recovers popular regularizations for MPM, including the $\ell_2$-regularization and class-reweighting. Furthermore, we show that our surrogate pushes the approximate hyperplane intuitively, facilitating not only robust but also interpretable recourses. The numerical results demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of our framework.</description>

      <title>A note on the complexity of the picker routing problem in multi-block warehouses and related problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Picker Routing Problem (PRP), which consists of finding a minimum-length tour between a set of storage locations in a warehouse, is one of the most important problems in the warehousing logistics literature. Despite its popularity, the tractability of the PRP in multi-block warehouses remains an open question. This technical note aims to fill this research gap by establishing that the problem is strongly NP-hard. As a corollary, the complexity status of other related problems is settled.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Logvinenko-Sereda Theorem for vector valued functions. That is, for an arbitrary Banach space $X$, all $p \in [1,\infty]$, all $\lambda \in (0,\infty)^d$, all $f \in L^p (\mathbb{R}^d ; X)$ with $\operatorname{supp} \mathcal{F} f \in \times_{i=1}^d (-\lambda_i/2 , \lambda_i /2)$, and all thick sets $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ we have \begin{equation*} \lVert \mathbf{1}_E f \rVert_{L^p (\mathbb{R}^d)} \geq C \lVert f \rVert_{L^p (\mathbb{R}^d)} . \end{equation*} The constant is explicitly known in dependence of the geometric parameters of the thick set and the parameter $\lambda$. As an application, we study control theory for normally elliptic operators on Banach spaces whose coefficients of their symbol are given by bounded linear operators. This includes systems of coupled parabolic equations or problems depending on a parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we identify the Fokker-Planck equation for (reflected) Sticky Brownian Motion as a Wasserstein gradient flow in the space of probability measures. The driving functional is the relative entropy with respect to a non-standard reference measure, the sum of an absolutely continuous interior part plus a singular part supported on the boundary. Taking the small time-step limit in a minimizing movement (JKO scheme) we prove existence of weak solutions for the coupled system of PDEs satisfying in addition an Energy Dissipation Inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is now possible to conduct large scale perturbation screens with complex readout modalities, such as different molecular profiles or high content cell images. While these open the way for systematic dissection of causal cell circuits, integrated such data across screens to maximize our ability to predict circuits poses substantial computational challenges, which have not been addressed. Here, we extend two Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport methods to incorporate the perturbation label for cross-modality alignment. The obtained alignment is then employed to train a predictive model that estimates cellular responses to perturbations observed with only one measurement modality. We validate our method for the tasks of cross-modality alignment and cross-modality prediction in a recent multi-modal single-cell perturbation dataset. Our approach opens the way to unified causal models of cell biology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography with additional optical current data supplemented from diffuse optical tomography. We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen coefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.</description>
