      <title>Modular abstract syntax trees (MAST): substitution tensors with second-class sorts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi's treatment of abstract syntax with binding, substitution, and holes to account for languages with second-class sorts. These situations include programming calculi such as the Call-by-Value lambda-calculus (CBV) and Levy's Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV). Prohibiting second-class sorts from appearing in variable contexts changes the characterisation of the abstract syntax from monoids in monoidal categories to actions in actegories. We reproduce much of the development through bicategorical arguments. We apply the resulting theory by proving substitution lemmata for varieties of CBV.</description>

      <title>OMPILOT: Harnessing Transformer Models for Auto Parallelization to Shared Memory Computing Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP, enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation metrics.</description>

      <title>How Natural Language Proficiency Shapes GenAI Code for Software Engineering Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Foundation Model (FM)-powered tools in software engineering, the natural language prompt has become a critical interface between developers and Large Language Models (LLMs). While much research has focused on prompt structure, the natural language proficiency is an underexplored factor that can influence the quality of generated code. This paper investigates whether the English language proficiency itself independent of the prompting technique affects the proficiency and correctness of code generated by LLMs. Using the HumanEval dataset, we systematically varied the English proficiency of prompts from basic to advanced for 164 programming tasks and measured the resulting code proficiency and correctness. Our findings show that LLMs default to an intermediate (B2) natural language level. While the effect on the resulting code proficiency was model-dependent, we found that higher-proficiency prompts consistently yielded more correct code across all models. These results demonstrate that natural language proficiency is a key lever for controlling code generation, helping developers tailor AI output and improve the reliability of solutions.</description>

      <title>Autocomp: A Powerful and Portable Code Optimizer for Tensor Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18574</link>

Abstract: Hardware accelerators, especially those designed for tensor processing, have become ubiquitous in today's computing landscape. However, even with significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization tasks, but generating low-resource languages, such as specialized tensor accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three distinct hardware platforms, we demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x faster than the vendor-provided library (Gemmini), outperforms expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.9x (AWS Trainium), and achieves 3.8x higher performance than a machine learning-based cost model for GPUs (NVIDIA L40S). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19176</link>

Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>
