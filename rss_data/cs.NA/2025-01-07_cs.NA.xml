      <title>Unveiling the gap between continuous and discrete adjoint lattice Boltzmann methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work rigorously derives the continuous and discrete adjoint lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs) for open flow systems, with a special focus on the resulting adjoint boundary conditions. It is found that the adjoint collision and adjoint streaming are exactly the same for the two adjoint methods, while the expressions, the objective derivative term and the execution order of the adjoint boundary conditions are totally different. The numerical performances of the two adjoint methods are comprehensively compared by performing sensitivity analysis on the 2D and 3D pipe bend cases. It is found that inconsistency or singularity exists in the continuous adjoint boundary conditions, leading to much inferior numerical stability of the adjoint solution and obvious numerical error in sensitivity. In contrast, the discrete adjoint LBM with fully consistent adjoint boundary conditions can always achieve exact sensitivity results and the theoretically highest numerical stability, without any increase of computational cost, thus it becomes a perfect solution to the inconsistency and instability issues in the continuous adjoint LBM. 3D microchannel heat sinks under various Reynolds numbers are also designed, and the esthetic and physically reasonable optimized designs are obtained, demonstrating the necessity and versatility of the presented discrete adjoint LBM.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reduced-Order Models for Port-Hamiltonian Systems with Operator Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian operator inference has been developed in [Sharma, H., Wang, Z., Kramer, B., Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 431, p.133122, 2022] to learn structure-preserving reduced-order models (ROMs) for Hamiltonian systems. The method constructs a low-dimensional model using only data and knowledge of the functional form of the Hamiltonian. The resulting ROMs preserve the intrinsic structure of the system, ensuring that the mechanical and physical properties of the system are maintained. In this work, we extend this approach to port-Hamiltonian systems, which generalize Hamiltonian systems by including energy dissipation, external input, and output. Based on snapshots of the system's state and output, together with the information about the functional form of the Hamiltonian, reduced operators are inferred through optimization and are then used to construct data-driven ROMs. To further alleviate the complexity of evaluating nonlinear terms in the ROMs, a hyper-reduction method via discrete empirical interpolation is applied. Accordingly, we derive error estimates for the ROM approximations of the state and output. Finally, we demonstrate the structure preservation, as well as the accuracy of the proposed port-Hamiltonian operator inference framework, through numerical experiments on a linear mass-spring-damper problem and a nonlinear Toda lattice problem.</description>

      <title>Can ChatGPT implement finite element models for geotechnical engineering applications?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study assesses the capability of ChatGPT to generate finite element code for geotechnical engineering applications from a set of prompts. We tested three different initial boundary value problems using a hydro-mechanically coupled formulation for unsaturated soils, including the dissipation of excess pore water pressure through fluid mass diffusion in one-dimensional space, time-dependent differential settlement of a strip footing, and gravity-driven seepage. For each case, initial prompting involved providing ChatGPT with necessary information for finite element implementation, such as balance and constitutive equations, problem geometry, initial and boundary conditions, material properties, and spatiotemporal discretization and solution strategies. Any errors and unexpected results were further addressed through prompt augmentation processes until the ChatGPT-generated finite element code passed the verification/validation test. Our results demonstrate that ChatGPT required minimal code revisions when using the FEniCS finite element library, owing to its high-level interfaces that enable efficient programming. In contrast, the MATLAB code generated by ChatGPT necessitated extensive prompt augmentations and/or direct human intervention, as it involves a significant amount of low-level programming required for finite element analysis, such as constructing shape functions or assembling global matrices. Given that prompt engineering for this task requires an understanding of the mathematical formulation and numerical techniques, this study suggests that while a large language model may not yet replace human programmers, it can greatly assist in the implementation of numerical models.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Gegenbauer Integral-Galerkin Method for Solving the Advection-Diffusion Equation With Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the Fourier-Gegenbauer Integral-Galerkin (FGIG) method, a novel and efficient numerical framework for solving the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation with periodic boundary conditions. The FGIG method uniquely combines Fourier series for spatial periodicity and Gegenbauer polynomials for temporal integration within a Galerkin framework, resulting in highly accurate numerical and semi-analytical solutions. Distinctively, this approach eliminates the need for time-stepping procedures by reformulating the problem as a system of integral equations, reducing error accumulation over long-time simulations and improving computational efficiency. Key contributions include exponential convergence rates for smooth solutions, robustness under oscillatory conditions, and an inherently parallelizable structure, enabling scalable computation for large-scale problems. Additionally, the method introduces a barycentric formulation of shifted-Gegenbauer-Gauss quadrature to ensure high accuracy and stability for relatively low P\'eclet numbers. Numerical experiments validate the method's superior performance over traditional techniques, demonstrating its potential for extending to higher-dimensional problems and diverse applications in computational mathematics and engineering.</description>

      <title>Improving the stability and efficiency of high-order operator-splitting methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator-splitting methods are widely used to solve differential equations, especially those that arise from multi-scale or multi-physics models, because a monolithic (single-method) approach may be inefficient or even infeasible. The most common operator-splitting methods are the first-order Lie--Trotter (or Godunov) and the second-order Strang (Strang--Marchuk) splitting methods. High-order splitting methods with real coefficients require backward-in-time integration in each operator and hence may be adversely impacted by instability for certain operators such as diffusion. However, besides the method coefficients, there are many other ancillary aspects to an overall operator-splitting method that are important but often overlooked. For example, the operator ordering and the choice of sub-integration methods can significantly affect the stability and efficiency of an operator-splitting method. In this paper, we investigate some design principles for the construction of operator-splitting methods, including minimization of local error measure, choice of sub-integration method, maximization of linear stability, and minimization of overall computational cost. We propose a new four-stage, third-order, 2-split operator-splitting method with seven sub-integrations per step and optimized linear stability for a benchmark problem from cardiac electrophysiology. We then propose a general principle to further improve stability and efficiency of such operator-splitting methods by using low-order, explicit sub-integrators for unstable sub-integrations. We demonstrate an almost 30\% improvement in the performance of methods derived from these design principles compared to the best-known third-order methods.</description>

      <title>The Mean Value Theorem: Analytical Proof and Computational Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore two fundamental theorems of differential calculus: Rolle's Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem (MVT). These theorems play a crucial role in the development of theoretical and practical results in mathematics, serving as the basis for various applications in analysis and modeling of real-world phenomena. Initially, we present the formal statements and their respective analytical proofs, highlighting the mathematical rigor necessary for understanding them. Additionally, we discuss the geometric interpretation of both theorems, emphasizing their importance in understanding properties of differentiable functions. The goal of this work is not only to validate these theorems through analytical methods but also to perform their computational verification, providing an integrated view between theory and practice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an auto-stabilized weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for solving Stokes equations without relying on traditional stabilizers. The proposed WG method accommodates both convex and non-convex polytopal elements in finite element partitions, leveraging bubble functions as a key analytical tool. The simplified WG method is symmetric and positive definite, and optimal-order error estimates are derived for WG approximations in both the discrete $H^1$ norm and the $L^2$ norm.</description>

      <title>Enhancing multigrid solvers for isogeometric analysis of nonlinear problems using polynomial extrapolation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When used to accelerate the convergence of fixed-point iterative methods, such as the Picard method, which is a kind of nonlinear fixed-point iteration, polynomial extrapolation techniques can be very effective. The numerical solution of nonlinear problems is further investigated in this study. Particularly, using multigrid with isogeometric analysis as a linear solver of the Picard iterative method, which is accelerated by applying vector extrapolation techniques, is how we address the nonlinear eigenvalue Bratu problem and the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. This paper provides quadratic convergence results for polynomial extrapolation methods. Specifically, a new theoretical result on the correlation between the residual norm and the error norm, as well as a new estimation for the generalized residual norm of some extrapolation methods, are given. We perform an investigation between the Picard method, the Picard method accelerated by polynomial extrapolation techniques, and the Anderson accelerated Picard method. Several numerical experiments show that the Picard method accelerated by polynomial extrapolation techniques can solve these nonlinear problems efficiently.</description>

      <title>Determination of Preferred Fiber Orientation State based on Newton-Raphson Method using Exact Jacobian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber orientation is an important descriptor of the intrinsic microstructure of polymer composite materials and the ability to predict the orientation state accurately and efficiently is crucial in evaluating the bulk thermo-mechanical behavior and consequently performance of printed part. Recent macroscopic fiber orientation models have employed the moment-tensor form in representing the fiber orientation state thus requiring some form of closure approximation of a higher order orientation tensor. Currently, different models have been developed to account for the added effect of rotary diffusion due to fiber-fiber and fiber matrix interactions and accurately simulate the experimentally observed slow fiber kinematics in polymer composite processing. Traditionally explicit numerical IVP-ODE transient solvers like the 4th order Runge Kutta method have been used to determine the steady-state fiber orientation. Here we propose a computationally efficient and faster method based on Newton-Raphson iterative technique for determining the preferred orientation state by evaluating the exact derivatives of the moment-tensor evolution equation with respect to the independent components of the orientation tensor. We consider various existing macroscopic-fiber orientation models and different closure approximations to ensure to ensure the robustness and reliability of the method, and we evaluate its performance and stability in determining physical solutions in various complex flow fields. Validation of the obtained exact partial derivatives of the material derivative of the orientation tensor is carried out by benchmarking with results of finite difference techniques.</description>

      <title>Hybridizable Symmetric Stress Elements on the Barycentric Refinement in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybridizable \(H(\textrm{div})\)-conforming finite elements for symmetric tensors on simplices with barycentric refinement are developed in this work for arbitrary dimensions and any polynomial order. By employing barycentric refinement and an intrinsic tangential-normal (\(t\)-\(n\)) decomposition, novel basis functions are constructed to redistribute degrees of freedom while preserving \(H(\textrm{div})\)-conformity and symmetry, and ensuring inf-sup stability. These hybridizable elements enhance computational flexibility and efficiency, with applications to mixed finite element methods for linear elasticity.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov equations for evaluating the boundary hitting of degenerate diffusion with unsteady drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jacobi diffusion is a representative diffusion process whose solution is bounded in a domain under certain conditions on its drift and diffusion coefficients. However, the process without such conditions has been far less investigated. We explore a Jacobi diffusion whose drift coefficient is modulated by another process, which causes the process to hit the boundary of a domain in finite time. The Kolmogorov equation (a degenerate elliptic partial differential equation) for evaluating the boundary hitting of the proposed Jacobi diffusion is then presented and mathematically analyzed. We also investigate a related mean field game arising in tourism management, where the drift depends on the index for sensor boundary hitting, thereby confining the process in a domain with a higher probability. In this case, the Kolmogorov equation becomes nonlinear. We propose a finite difference method applicable to both the linear and nonlinear Kolmogorov equations that yields a unique numerical solution due to discrete ellipticity. The accuracy of the finite difference method critically depends on the regularity of the boundary condition, and the use of a high-order discretization method is not always effective. Finally, we computationally investigate the mean field effect.</description>

      <title>Scaled-cPIKANs: Domain Scaling in Chebyshev-based Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are integral to modeling many scientific and engineering problems. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising tools for solving PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network loss function. However, when dealing with PDEs characterized by strong oscillatory dynamics over large computational domains, PINNs based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) often exhibit poor convergence and reduced accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Scaled-cPIKAN, a physics-informed architecture rooted in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Scaled-cPIKAN integrates Chebyshev polynomial representations with a domain scaling approach that transforms spatial variables in PDEs into the standardized domain \([-1,1]^d\), as intrinsically required by Chebyshev polynomials. By combining the flexibility of Chebyshev-based KANs (cKANs) with the physics-driven principles of PINNs, and the spatial domain transformation, Scaled-cPIKAN enables efficient representation of oscillatory dynamics across extended spatial domains while improving computational performance. We demonstrate Scaled-cPIKAN efficacy using four benchmark problems: the diffusion equation, the Helmholtz equation, the Allen-Cahn equation, as well as both forward and inverse formulations of the reaction-diffusion equation (with and without noisy data). Our results show that Scaled-cPIKAN significantly outperforms existing methods in all test cases. In particular, it achieves several orders of magnitude higher accuracy and faster convergence rate, making it a highly efficient tool for approximating PDE solutions that feature oscillatory behavior over large spatial domains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greedy algorithms, particularly the orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA), have proven effective in training shallow neural networks for fitting functions and solving partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we extend the application of OGA to the tasks of linear operator learning, which is equivalent to learning the kernel function through integral transforms. Firstly, a novel greedy algorithm is developed for kernel estimation rate in a new semi-inner product, which can be utilized to approximate the Green's function of linear PDEs from data. Secondly, we introduce the OGA for point-wise kernel estimation to further improve the approximation rate, achieving orders of accuracy improvement across various tasks and baseline models. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis on the kernel estimation problem and the optimal approximation rates for both algorithms, establishing their efficacy and potential for future applications in PDEs and operator learning tasks.</description>

      <title>A subspace-conjugate gradient method for linear matrix equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient solution of large-scale multiterm linear matrix equations is a challenging task in numerical linear algebra, and it is a largely open problem. We propose a new iterative scheme for symmetric and positive definite operators, significantly advancing methods such as truncated matrix-oriented Conjugate Gradients (CG). The new algorithm capitalizes on the low-rank matrix format of its iterates by fully exploiting the subspace information of the factors as iterations proceed. The approach implicitly relies on orthogonality conditions imposed over much larger subspaces than in CG, unveiling insightful connections with subspace projection methods. The new method is also equipped with memory-saving strategies. In particular, we show that for a given matrix $\mathbf{Y}$, the action $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{Y})$ in low rank format may not be evaluated exactly due to memory constraints. This problem is often underestimated, though it will eventually produce Out-of-Memory breakdowns for a sufficiently large number of terms. We propose an ad-hoc randomized range-finding strategy that appears to fully resolve this shortcoming. Experimental results with typical application problems illustrate the potential of our approach over various methods developed in the recent literature.</description>

      <title>On the numerical evaluation of wall shear stress using the finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall shear stress (WSS) is a crucial hemodynamic quantity extensively studied in cardiovascular research, yet its numerical computation is not straightforward. This work aims to compare WSS results obtained from two different finite element discretizations, quantify the differences between continuous and discontinuous stresses, and introduce a novel method for WSS evaluation through the formulation of a boundary-flux problem. Two benchmark problems are considered - a 2D Stokes flow on a unit square and a 3D Poiseuille flow through a cylindrical pipe. These are followed by investigations of steady-state Navier-Stokes flow in two patient-specific aneurysms. The study focuses on P1/P1 stabilized and Taylor-Hood P2/P1 mixed finite elements for velocity and pressure. WSS is computed using either the proposed boundary-flux method or as a projection of tangential traction onto First order Lagrange (P1), Discontinuous Galerkin first order (DG-1), or Discontinuous Galerkin zero order (DG-0) space. For the P1/P1 stabilized element, the boundary-flux and P1 projection methods yielded equivalent results. With the P2/P1 element, the boundary-flux evaluation demonstrated faster convergence in the Poiseuille flow example but showed increased sensitivity to pressure field inaccuracies in patient-specific geometries compared to the projection method. In patient-specific cases, the P2/P1 element exhibited superior robustness to mesh size when evaluating average WSS and low shear area (LSA), outperforming the P1/P1 stabilized element. Projecting discontinuous finite element results into continuous spaces can introduce artifacts, such as the Gibbs phenomenon. Consequently, it becomes crucial to carefully select the finite element space for boundary stress calculations - not only in applications involving WSS computations for aneurysms.</description>

      <title>Solving the Porous Medium Equation with the eXtreme Mesh deformation approach (X-Mesh)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new scheme for solving the non-regularized Porous Medium Equation. It is mass conserving and uses only positive unknown values. To address these typically conflicting features, we employ the eXtreme Mesh deformation approach (X-Mesh), specifically designed for problems involving sharp interfaces. The method ensures that the interface is always meshed, even in the face of complex topological changes, without the need for remeshing or altering the mesh topology. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach through various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A unifying moving mesh method for curves, surfaces, and domains based on mesh equidistribution and alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unifying moving mesh method is developed for general $m$-dimensional geometric objects in $d$-dimensions ($d \ge 1$ and $1\le m \le d$) including curves, surfaces, and domains. The method is based on mesh equidistribution and alignment and does not require the availability of an analytical parametric representation of the underlying geometric object. Mathematical characterizations of shape and size of $m$-simplexes and properties of corresponding edge matrices and affine mappings are derived. The equidistribution and alignment conditions are presented in a unifying form for $m$-simplicial meshes. The equation for mesh movement is defined based on the moving mesh PDE approach, and suitable projection of the nodal mesh velocities is employed to ensure the mesh points stay on the underlying geometric object. The analytical expression for the mesh velocities is obtained in a compact matrix form. The nonsingularity of moving meshes is proved. Numerical results for curves ($m=1$) and surfaces ($m=2$) in two and three dimensions are presented to demonstrate the ability of the developed method to move mesh points without causing singularity and control their concentration.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Analysis of Shear Lag Effect in Long-Span Single-Box Continuous Rigid Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03093v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the span and width of continuous rigid bridges increase, the complexity of the spatial forces acting on these structures also grows, challenging traditional design methods. Primary beam theory often fails to accurately predict the stresses in the bridge girder, leading to potential overestimation of the ultimate capacity of these bridges. This study addresses this gap by developing a detailed finite element (FE) model of a continuous rigid bridge using ABAQUS, which accounts for the complex 3D geometry, construction procedures, and nonlinear material interactions. A loading test on a 210-meter continuous rigid bridge is performed to validate the model, with the measured strain and deflection data closely matching the FE simulation results. The study also examines stress distributions under constant and live loads, as well as the shear lag coefficients of the main girder. Through parametric analysis, we explore the effects of varying the width-to-span and height-to-width ratios. The results reveal that both a wider box girder and a larger span significantly amplify the shear lag effect in the bridge girder. The findings enhance the understanding of stress distribution in large-scale rigid bridges and provide critical insights for more accurate design and as-sessment of such structures.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Bayesian optimisation in reduced dimension for engineering design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimisation is an adaptive sampling strategy for constructing a Gaussian process surrogate to emulate a black-box computational model with the aim of efficiently searching for the global minimum. However, Gaussian processes have limited applicability for engineering problems with many design variables. Their scalability can be significantly improved by identifying a low-dimensional vector of latent variables that serve as inputs to the Gaussian process. In this paper, we introduce a multi-view learning strategy that considers both the input design variables and output data representing the objective or constraint functions, to identify a low-dimensional space of latent variables. Adopting a fully probabilistic viewpoint, we use probabilistic partial least squares (PPLS) to learn an orthogonal mapping from the design variables to the latent variables using training data consisting of inputs and outputs of the black-box computational model. The latent variables and posterior probability densities of the probabilistic partial least squares and Gaussian process models are determined sequentially and iteratively, with retraining occurring at each adaptive sampling iteration. We compare the proposed probabilistic partial least squares Bayesian optimisation (PPLS-BO) strategy to its deterministic counterpart, partial least squares Bayesian optimisation (PLS-BO), and classical Bayesian optimisation, demonstrating significant improvements in convergence to the global minimum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling real world systems frequently requires the solution of systems of nonlinear equations. A number of approaches have been suggested and developed for this computational problem. However, it is also possible to attempt solutions using more general nonlinear least squares or function minimization techniques. There are concerns, nonetheless, that we may fail to find solutions, or that the process will be inefficient. Examples are presented with R with the goal of providing guidance on the solution of nonlinear equations problems.</description>

      <title>sTiles: An Accelerated Computational Framework for Sparse Factorizations of Structured Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces sTiles, a GPU-accelerated framework for factorizing sparse structured symmetric matrices. By leveraging tile algorithms for fine-grained computations, sTiles uses a structure-aware task execution flow to handle challenging arrowhead sparse matrices with variable bandwidths, common in scientific and engineering fields. It minimizes fill-in during Cholesky factorization using permutation techniques and employs a static scheduler to manage tasks on shared-memory systems with GPU accelerators. sTiles balances tile size and parallelism, where larger tiles enhance algorithmic intensity but increase floating-point operations and memory usage, while parallelism is constrained by the arrowhead structure. To expose more parallelism, a left-looking Cholesky variant breaks sequential dependencies in trailing submatrix updates via tree reductions. Evaluations show sTiles achieves speedups of up to 8.41X, 9.34X, 5.07X, and 11.08X compared to CHOLMOD, SymPACK, MUMPS, and PARDISO, respectively, and a 5X speedup compared to a 32-core AMD EPYC CPU on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Our generic software framework imports well-established concepts from dense matrix computations but they all require customizations in their deployments on hybrid architectures to best handle factorizations of sparse matrices with arrowhead structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated polaritons are necessary for entering the quantum photonic regime with many applications. We simulate exciton-polariton condensation using the finite-difference and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods with the strongly correlated polariton condition incorporated in the mean-field equations and analyze the polariton dynamics. This is done for coherent, near-resonant pumping as well as homogeneous, incoherent, non-resonant pumping. We find conditions akin to the polariton blockade in the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this work we define a spline complex preserving the cohomological structure of the continuous de Rham complex when the underlying physical domain is a toroidal solid. In the spirit of the isogeometric analysis, the spaces involved will be defined as pushforward of suitable spline spaces on a parametric domain. The singularity of the parametrization of the solid will demand the imposition of smoothness constraints on the full tensor product spline spaces in the parametric domain to properly set up the discrete complex on the physical domain.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo finite element approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations with initial data modeled by log-normal random fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the numerical approximation of the Navier-Stokes problem over a bounded polygonal domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the initial condition is modeled by a log-normal random field. This problem usually arises in the area of uncertainty quantification. We aim to compute the expectation value of linear functionals of the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations and perform a rigorous error analysis for the problem. In particular, our method includes the finite element, fully-discrete discretizations, truncated Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion for the realizations of the initial condition, and lattice-based quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method to estimate the expected values over the parameter space. Our QMC analysis is based on randomly-shifted lattice rules for the integration over the domain in high-dimensional space, which guarantees the error decays with $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\delta})$, where $N$ is the number of sampling points, $\delta&gt;0$ is an arbitrary small number, and the constant in the decay estimate is independent of the dimension of integration.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present a low-rank algorithm for computing low-rank approximations of large-scale Lyapunov operator $\varphi$-functions. These computations play a crucial role in implementing of matrix-valued exponential integrators for large-scale stiff matrix differential equations, where the (approximate) solutions are of low rank.The proposed method employs a scaling and recursive procedure, complemented by a quasi-backward error analysis to determine the optimal parameters. The computational cost is primarily determined by the multiplication of sparse matrices with block vectors. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method as a foundational tool for matrix-valued exponential integrators in solving differential Lyapunov equations and Riccati equations.</description>

      <title>Construction of Hierarchically Semi-Separable matrix Representation using Adaptive Johnson-Lindenstrauss Sketching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of an adaptive, partially matrix-free, Hierarchically Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix construction algorithm by Gorman et al. [SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 41(5), 2019] which uses Gaussian sketching operators to a broader class of Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) sketching operators. We develop theoretical work which justifies this extension. In particular, we extend the earlier concentration bounds to all JL sketching operators and examine this bound for specific classes of such operators including the original Gaussian sketching operators, subsampled randomized Hadamard transform (SRHT) and the sparse Johnson--Lindenstrauss transform (SJLT). We discuss the implementation details of applying SJLT and SRHT efficiently. Then we demonstrate experimentally that using SJLT or SRHT instead of Gaussian sketching operators leads to up to 2.5x speedups of the serial HSS construction implementation in the STRUMPACK C++ library. Additionally, we discuss the implementation of a parallel distributed HSS construction that leverages Gaussian or SJLT sketching operators. We observe a performance improvement of up to 35x when using SJLT sketching operators over Gaussian sketching operators. The generalized algorithm allows users to select their own JL sketching operators with theoretical lower bounds on the size of the operators which may lead to faster run time with similar HSS construction accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an error estimate for the u-series method of the Coulomb interaction in molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the number of truncated Gaussians $M$ in the u-series and the base of interpolation nodes $b$ in the bilateral serial approximation are two key parameters for the algorithm accuracy, and that the errors converge as $\mathcal{O}(b^{-M})$ for the energy and $\mathcal{O}(b^{-3M})$ for the force. Error bounds due to numerical quadrature and cutoff in both the electrostatic energy and forces are obtained. Closed-form formulae are also provided, which are useful in the parameter setup for simulations under a given accuracy. The results are verified by analyzing the errors of two practical systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider problems related to initial meshing and adaptive mesh refinement for the electromagnetic simulation of various structures. The quality of the initial mesh and the performance of the adaptive refinement are of great importance for the finite element solution of the Maxwell equations, since they directly affect the accuracy and the computational time. In this paper, we describe the complete meshing workflow, which allows the simulation of arbitrary structures. Test simulations confirm that the presented approach allows to reach the quality of the industrial simulation software.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the limit load, limit analysis and shear strength reduction methods, which are commonly employed in geotechnical stability analysis or similar applications. The aim is to make these methods more approachable by introducing a unified framework based on abstract convex optimization and its parametric studies. We establish suitable assumptions on the abstract problems that capture the selected features of these methods and facilitate rigorous theoretical investigation. Further, we propose continuation techniques tailored to the resulting parametric problem formulations and show that the developed abstract framework could also be useful outside the domain of geotechnical stability analysis. The main results are illustrated with analytical and numerical examples. The numerical example deals with a 3D slope stability problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical methods for the Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations with Basset history term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maxey-Riley-Gatignol equations (MRGE) describe the motion of a finite-sized, spherical particle in a fluid. Because of wake effects, the force acting on a particle depends on its past trajectory. This is modelled by an integral term in the MRGE, also called Basset force, that makes its numerical solution challenging and memory intensive. A recent approach proposed by Prasath et al. exploits connections between the integral term and fractional derivatives to reformulate the MRGE as a time-dependent partial differential equation on a semi-infinite pseudo-space. They also propose a numerical algorithm based on polynomial expansions. This paper develops a numerical approach based on finite difference instead, by adopting techniques by Koleva et al. and Fazio et al. to cope with the issues of having an unbounded spatial domain. We compare convergence order and computational efficiency for particles of varying size and density of the polynomial expansion by Prasath et al., our finite difference schemes and a direct integrator for the MRGE based on multi-step methods proposed by Daitche. While all methods achieve their theoretical convergence order for neutrally buoyant particles with zero initial relative velocity, they suffer from various degrees of order reduction if the initial relative velocity is non-zero or the particle has a different density than the fluid.</description>

      <title>Full error analysis of the random deep splitting method for nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.</description>

      <title>Arithmetical enhancements of the Kogbetliantz method for the SVD of order two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An enhanced Kogbetliantz method for the singular value decomposition (SVD) of general matrices of order two is proposed. The method consists of three phases: an almost exact prescaling, that can be beneficial to the LAPACK's xLASV2 routine for the SVD of upper triangular 2x2 matrices as well, a highly relatively accurate triangularization in the absence of underflows, and an alternative procedure for computing the SVD of triangular matrices, that employs the correctly rounded hypot function. A heuristic for improving numerical orthogonality of the left singular vectors is also presented and tested on a wide spectrum of random input matrices. On upper triangular matrices under test, the proposed method, unlike xLASV2, finds both singular values with high relative accuracy as long as the input elements are within a safe range that is almost as wide as the entire normal range. On general matrices of order two, the method's safe range for which the smaller singular values remain accurate is of about half the width of the normal range.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a method for simultaneously generating high order quadrature weights for integrals over Lipschitz domains and their boundaries that requires neither meshing nor moment computation. The weights are determined on pre-defined scattered nodes as a minimum norm solution of a sparse underdetermined linear system arising from a discretization of a suitable boundary value problem by either collocation or meshless finite differences. The method is easy to implement independently of the domain's representation, since it only requires as inputs the position of all quadrature nodes and the direction of outward-pointing normals at each node belonging to the boundary. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and high accuracy of the method on a number of smooth and piecewise smooth domains in 2D and 3D, including some with reentrant corners and edges.</description>

      <title>Coordinate complexification for the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a perturbed half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new complexification scheme based on the classical double layer potential for the solution of the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in compactly perturbed half-spaces in two and three dimensions. The kernel for the double layer potential is the normal derivative of the free-space Green's function, which has a well-known analytic continuation into the complex plane as a function of both target and source locations. Here, we prove that - when the incident data are analytic and satisfy a precise asymptotic estimate - the solution to the boundary integral equation itself admits an analytic continuation into specific regions of the complex plane, and satisfies a related asymptotic estimate (this class of data includes both plane waves and the field induced by point sources). We then show that, with a carefully chosen contour deformation, the oscillatory integrals are converted to exponentially decaying integrals, effectively reducing the infinite domain to a domain of finite size. Our scheme is different from existing methods that use complex coordinate transformations, such as perfectly matched layers, or absorbing regions, such as the gradual complexification of the governing wavenumber. More precisely, in our method, we are still solving a boundary integral equation, albeit on a truncated, complexified version of the original boundary. In other words, no volumetric/domain modifications are introduced. The scheme can be extended to other boundary conditions, to open wave guides and to layered media. We illustrate the performance of the scheme with two and three dimensional examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann framework for multiphase flows by Eulerian-Eulerian Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10399v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is relatively straightforward, it demands a well-crafted framework to handle the complex partial differential equations involved in multiphase flow simulations. For the first time to our knowledge, this work proposes a novel LBM framework to solve Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow equations, without any finite difference correction, including very large density ratios and also a realistic relation for the drag coefficient. The proposed methodology and all reported LBM formulas can be applied to any dimension. This opens a promising venue for simulating multiphase flows on large High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities and on novel parallel hardware. This LBM framework consists of six coupled LBM schemes - running on the same lattice - ensuring an efficient implementation in large codes with minimum effort. The preliminary numeral results agree in an excellent way with the a reference numerical solution obtained by a traditional finite difference solver.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Network Partitioning for Solution of Potential-Driven, Steady-State Nonlinear Network Flow Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution of potential-driven steady-state flow in large networks is a task which manifests in various engineering applications, such as transport of natural gas or water through pipeline networks. The resultant system of nonlinear equations depends on the network topology and in general there is no numerical algorithm that offers guaranteed convergence to the solution (assuming a solution exists). Some methods offer guarantees in cases where the network topology satisfies certain assumptions, but these methods fail for larger networks. On the other hand, the Newton-Raphson algorithm offers a convergence guarantee if the starting point lies close to the (unknown) solution. It would be advantageous to compute the solution of the large nonlinear system through the solution of smaller nonlinear sub-systems wherein the solution algorithms (Newton-Raphson or otherwise) are more likely to succeed. This article proposes and describes such a procedure, an hierarchical network partitioning algorithm that enables the solution of large nonlinear systems corresponding to potential-driven steady-state network flow equations.</description>

      <title>Single-Frequency Self-Alignment RF Resonant Beam for Information and Power Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10151v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to power attenuation, improving transmission efficiency in the radio-frequency (RF) band remains a significant challenge, which hinders advancements in various fields of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as wireless power transfer (WPT) and wireless communication. Array design and retro-directive beamforming (RD-BF) techniques offer simple and effective ways to enhance transmission efficiency. However, when the target is an array or in the near field, the RD-BF system (RD-BFS) cannot radiate more energy to the target due to phase irregularities in the target region, resulting in challenges in achieving higher efficiency. To address this issue, we propose the RF-based resonant beam system (RF-RBS), which adaptively optimizes phase and power distribution between transmitting and receiving arrays by leveraging the resonance mechanism to achieve higher transmission efficiency. We analyze the system structure and develop an analytical model to evaluate power flow and resonance establishment. Numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed RF-RBS achieves self-alignment without beam control and provides higher transmission efficiency compared to RD-BFS, with improvements of up to 16%. This self-alignment capability allows the system to effectively transfer power and information across varying distances and offsets. The numerical results indicate the capability to transmit watt-level power and achieve 21 bps/Hz of downlink spectral efficiency in indoor settings, highlighting the advantages of RF-RBS in information and power transfer for mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Bi-Band ECoGNet for ECoG Decoding on Classification Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the application of brain-computer interface (BCI), being able to accurately decode brain signals is a critical task. For the multi-class classification task of brain signal ECoG, how to improve the classification accuracy is one of the current research hotspots. ECoG acquisition uses a high-density electrode array and a high sampling frequency, which makes ECoG data have a certain high similarity and data redundancy in the temporal domain, and also unique spatial pattern in spatial domain. How to effectively extract features is both exciting and challenging. Previous work found that visual-related ECoG can carry visual information via frequency and spatial domain. Based on this finding, we focused on using deep learning to design frequency and spatial feature extraction modules, and proposed a Bi-Band ECoGNet model based on deep learning. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) The Bi-BCWT (Bi-Band Channel-Wise Transform) neural network module is designed to replace the time-consume method MST, this module greatly improves the model calculation and data storage efficiency, and effectively increases the training speed; 2) The Bi-BCWT module can effectively take into account the information both in low-frequency and high-frequency domain, which is more conducive to ECoG multi-classification tasks; 3) ECoG is acquired using 2D electrode array, the newly designed 2D Spatial-Temporal feature encoder can extract the 2D spatial feature better. Experiments have shown that the unique 2D spatial data structure can effectively improve classification accuracy; 3) Compared with previous work, the Bi-Band ECoGNet model is smaller and has higher performance, with an accuracy increase of 1.24%, and the model training speed is increased by 6 times, which is more suitable for BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Error Bounds Near Sharp Interface Limit for Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of geometric surface evolutions, stochastic reaction-diffusion equation provides a powerful tool for capturing and simulating complex dynamics. A critical challenge in this area is developing numerical approximations that exhibit error bounds with polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$, where the small parameter $\vv&gt;0$ represents the diffuse interface thickness. The existence of such bounds for fully discrete approximations of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations remains unclear in the literature. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality to overcome the exponential growth of $\vv^{-1}$. Furthermore, we establish the numerical weak error bounds under the truncated Wasserstein distance for the spectral Galerkin method and a fully discrete tamed Euler scheme, with explicit polynomial dependence on $\vv^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: Non-local systems of conservation laws play a crucial role in modeling flow mechanisms across various scenarios. The well-posedness of such problems is typically established by demonstrating the convergence of robust first-order schemes. However, achieving more accurate solutions necessitates the development of higher-order schemes. In this article, we present a fully discrete, second-order scheme for a general class of non-local conservation law systems in multiple spatial dimensions. The method employs a MUSCL-type spatial reconstruction coupled with Runge-Kutta time integration. The proposed scheme is proven to preserve positivity in all the unknowns and exhibits L-infinity stability. Numerical experiments conducted on both the non-local scalar and system cases illustrate the8 importance of second-order scheme when compared to its first-order counterpart.</description>

      <title>Efficient cell-centered nodal integral method for multi-dimensional Burgers equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient coarse-mesh nodal integral method (NIM), based on cell-centered variables and referred to as cell-centered NIM (CCNIM), is developed and applied for solving multi-dimensional, time-dependent, Burgers equations. Unlike traditional NIM, which utilizes surface-averaged variables as discrete unknowns, this innovative approach formulates the final expression of the numerical scheme using discrete unknowns represented by cell-centered or node-averaged variables. By relying on these cell centroids, the proposed CCNIM approach presents several advantages compared to traditional NIM. These include a simplified implementation process in terms of local coordinate systems, enhanced flexibility regarding the higher order of accuracy in time, straightforward formulation for higher-degree temporal derivatives, and offering a viable option for coupling with other physics. The multidimensional time-dependent Burgers' problems with known analytical solutions are solved in order to validate the developed scheme. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the proposed CCNIM approach and other traditional NIM schemes is conducted to showcase its effectiveness. The simplicity and robustness of the approach provide a strong foundation for its seamless extension to more complex fluid flow problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling can attain far better accuracy than plain Monte Carlo sampling. However, with plain Monte Carlo sampling it is much easier to estimate the attained accuracy. This article describes methods old and new to quantify the error in quasi-Monte Carlo estimates. An important challenge in this setting is that the goal of getting accuracy conflicts with that of estimating the attained accuracy. A related challenge is that rigorous uncertainty quantifications can be extremely conservative. A recent surprise is that some RQMC estimates have nearly symmetric distributions and that has the potential to allow confidence intervals that do not require either a central limit theorem or a consistent variance estimate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the past 30 years or so, machine learning has stimulated a great deal of research in the study of approximation capabilities (expressive power) of a multitude of processes, such as approximation by shallow or deep neural networks, radial basis function networks, and a variety of kernel based methods. Motivated by applications such as invariant learning, transfer learning, and synthetic aperture radar imaging, we initiate in this paper a general approach to study the approximation capabilities of kernel based networks using non-symmetric kernels. While singular value decomposition is a natural instinct to study such kernels, we consider a more general approach to include the use of a family of kernels, such as generalized translation networks (which include neural networks and translation invariant kernels as special cases) and rotated zonal function kernels. Naturally, unlike traditional kernel based approximation, we cannot require the kernels to be positive definite. In particular, we obtain estimates on the accuracy of uniform approximation of functions in a Sobolev class by ReLU$^r$ networks when $r$ is not necessarily an integer. Our general results apply to the approximation of functions with small smoothness compared to the dimension of the input space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the exploration of rectangular finite elements' ability to model the stress-strain state of isotropic and orthotropic materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, known as auxetic materials. By employing linear elasticity in the plane stress formulation, the research evaluates the linear compatible and the quadratic incompatible shape functions in describing the mechanical behavior of auxetic materials within a displacement-based finite element method under static shear and indentation. Additionally, the analytical expression of an incompatible rectangular finite element is adapted to accommodate an orthotropic case. Hexachiral and re-entrant honeycomb structures, characterized by auxetic behavior, are modeled as continuous media with homogenized properties using analytical expressions for their effective material constants. The findings reveal that while the classical shape functions may be sufficient for displacement modeling, they are ineffective in accurately predicting the characteristic auxetic behavior and stress distributions in auxetic materials. In contrast, the incompatible shape functions prove to be effective in providing appropriate stress modeling in both cases. This work underscores the relevance of the incompatible rectangular finite elements in the analysis of advanced materials with a negative Poisson's ratio. It provides computationally efficient approaches for the calculation of auxetic honeycomb structures and multilayer composites based on them.</description>

Abstract: 3 families of 4-dimensional lattices $L_k, M_k, M_k / 2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ are defined. Each lattice is defined by 2 quadratic extensions and has a \emph{finite} number of unit vectors, but the number of unit vectors in each of the 3 familes is \emph{unbounded}. $L_3$ is the Moser lattice.</description>
