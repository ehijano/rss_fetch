      <title>A Semi-automatic Cranial Implant Design Tool Based on Rigid ICP Template Alignment and Voxel Space Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traumatic medical emergencies, the patients heavily depend on cranioplasty - the craft of neurocranial repair using cranial implants. Despite the improvements made in recent years, the design of a patient-specific implant (PSI) is among the most complex, expensive, and least automated tasks in cranioplasty. Further research in this area is needed. Therefore, we created a prototype application with a graphical user interface (UI) specifically tailored for semi-automatic implant generation, where the users only need to perform high-level actions. A general outline of the proposed implant generation process involves setting an area of interest, aligning the templates, and then creating the implant in voxel space. Furthermore, we show that the alignment can be improved significantly, by only considering clipped geometry in the vicinity of the defect border. The software prototype will be open-sourced at https://github.com/3Descape/Cranial_Implant_Design</description>

      <title>Interactive Manipulation and Visualization of 3D Brain MRI for Surgical Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern medical diagnostics, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important technique that provides detailed insights into anatomical structures. In this paper, we present a comprehensive methodology focusing on streamlining the segmentation, reconstruction, and visualization process of 3D MRI data. Segmentation involves the extraction of anatomical regions with the help of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. Then, 3D reconstruction converts segmented data from the previous step into multiple 3D representations. Finally, the visualization stage provides efficient and interactive presentations of both 2D and 3D MRI data. Integrating these three steps, the proposed system is able to augment the interpretability of the anatomical information from MRI scans according to our interviews with doctors. Even though this system was originally designed and implemented as part of human brain haptic feedback simulation for surgeon training, it can also provide experienced medical practitioners with an effective tool for clinical data analysis, surgical planning and other purposes</description>

      <title>Efficient EndoNeRF Reconstruction and Its Application for Data-driven Surgical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The healthcare industry has a growing need for realistic modeling and efficient simulation of surgical scenes. With effective models of deformable surgical scenes, clinicians are able to conduct surgical planning and surgery training on scenarios close to real-world cases. However, a significant challenge in achieving such a goal is the scarcity of high-quality soft tissue models with accurate shapes and textures. To address this gap, we present a data-driven framework that leverages emerging neural radiance field technology to enable high-quality surgical reconstruction and explore its application for surgical simulations. We first focus on developing a fast NeRF-based surgical scene 3D reconstruction approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance. This method can significantly outperform traditional 3D reconstruction methods, which have failed to capture large deformations and produce fine-grained shapes and textures. We then propose an automated creation pipeline of interactive surgical simulation environments through a closed mesh extraction algorithm. Our experiments have validated the superior performance and efficiency of our proposed approach in surgical scene 3D reconstruction. We further utilize our reconstructed soft tissues to conduct FEM and MPM simulations, showcasing the practical application of our method in data-driven surgical simulations.</description>

      <title>On Generating Cancelable Biometric Template using Reverse of Boolean XOR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancelable Biometric is repetitive distortion embedded in original Biometric image for keeping it secure from unauthorized access. In this paper, we have generated Cancelable Biometric templates with Reverse Boolean XOR technique. Three different methods have been proposed for generation of Cancelable Biometric templates based on Visual Secret Sharing scheme. In each method, one Secret image and n-1 Cover images are used as: (M1) One original Biometric image (Secret) with n- 1 randomly chosen Gray Cover images (M2) One original Secret image with n-1 Cover images, which are Randomly Permuted version of the original Secret image (M3) One Secret image with n-1 Cover images, both Secret image and Cover images are Randomly Permuted version of original Biometric image. Experiment works have performed on publicly available ORL Face database and IIT Delhi Iris database. The performance of the proposed methods is compared in terms of Co-relation Coefficient (Cr), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR), and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI). It is found that among the three proposed method, M3 generates good quality Cancelable templates and gives best performance in terms of quality. M3 is also better in quantitative terms on ORL dataset while M2 and M3 are comparable on IIT Delhi Iris dataset.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Kernel Prior Model for Unsupervised Blind Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant successes on solving the blind super-resolution (BSR) problem. However, most of them request supervised pre-training on labelled datasets. This paper proposes an unsupervised kernel estimation model, named dynamic kernel prior (DKP), to realize an unsupervised and pre-training-free learning-based algorithm for solving the BSR problem. DKP can adaptively learn dynamic kernel priors to realize real-time kernel estimation, and thereby enables superior HR image restoration performances. This is achieved by a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling process on random kernel distributions. The learned kernel prior is then assigned to optimize a blur kernel estimation network, which entails a network-based Langevin dynamic optimization strategy. These two techniques ensure the accuracy of the kernel estimation. DKP can be easily used to replace the kernel estimation models in the existing methods, such as Double-DIP and FKP-DIP, or be added to the off-the-shelf image restoration model, such as diffusion model. In this paper, we incorporate our DKP model with DIP and diffusion model, referring to DIP-DKP and Diff-DKP, for validations. Extensive simulations on Gaussian and motion kernel scenarios demonstrate that the proposed DKP model can significantly improve the kernel estimation with comparable runtime and memory usage, leading to state-of-the-art BSR results. The code is available at https://github.com/XYLGroup/DKP.</description>

      <title>Mitigating False Predictions In Unreasonable Body Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite considerable strides in developing deep learning models for 3D medical image segmentation, the challenge of effectively generalizing across diverse image distributions persists. While domain generalization is acknowledged as vital for robust application in clinical settings, the challenges stemming from training with a limited Field of View (FOV) remain unaddressed. This limitation leads to false predictions when applied to body regions beyond the FOV of the training data. In response to this problem, we propose a novel loss function that penalizes predictions in implausible body regions, applicable in both single-dataset and multi-dataset training schemes. It is realized with a Body Part Regression model that generates axial slice positional scores. Through comprehensive evaluation using a test set featuring varying FOVs, our approach demonstrates remarkable improvements in generalization capabilities. It effectively mitigates false positive tumor predictions up to 85% and significantly enhances overall segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Model Prototyping through the MedMNIST+ Dataset Collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning based systems in clinical practice is often impeded by challenges rooted in limited and heterogeneous medical datasets. In addition, prioritization of marginal performance improvements on a few, narrowly scoped benchmarks over clinical applicability has slowed down meaningful algorithmic progress. This trend often results in excessive fine-tuning of existing methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on selected datasets rather than fostering clinically relevant innovations. In response, this work presents a comprehensive benchmark for the MedMNIST+ database to diversify the evaluation landscape and conduct a thorough analysis of common convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based architectures, for medical image classification. Our evaluation encompasses various medical datasets, training methodologies, and input resolutions, aiming to reassess the strengths and limitations of widely used model variants. Our findings suggest that computationally efficient training schemes and modern foundation models hold promise in bridging the gap between expensive end-to-end training and more resource-refined approaches. Additionally, contrary to prevailing assumptions, we observe that higher resolutions may not consistently improve performance beyond a certain threshold, advocating for the use of lower resolutions, particularly in prototyping stages, to expedite processing. Notably, our analysis reaffirms the competitiveness of convolutional models compared to ViT-based architectures emphasizing the importance of comprehending the intrinsic capabilities of different model architectures. Moreover, we hope that our standardized evaluation framework will help enhance transparency, reproducibility, and comparability on the MedMNIST+ dataset collection as well as future research within the field. Code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Perception and Localization of Macular Degeneration Applying Convolutional Neural Network, ResNet and Grad-CAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known retinal disease that feels blurry visions to the affected patients is Macular Degeneration. This research is based on classifying the healthy and macular degeneration fundus with localizing the affected region of the fundus. A CNN architecture and CNN with ResNet architecture (ResNet50, ResNet50v2, ResNet101, ResNet101v2, ResNet152, ResNet152v2) as the backbone are used to classify the two types of fundus. The data are split into three categories including (a) Training set is 90% and Testing set is 10% (b) Training set is 80% and Testing set is 20%, (c) Training set is 50% and Testing set is 50%. After the training, the best model has been selected from the evaluation metrics. Among the models, CNN with backbone of ResNet50 performs best which gives the training accuracy of 98.7\% for 90\% train and 10\% test data split. With this model, we have performed the Grad-CAM visualization to get the region of affected area of fundus.</description>

      <title>Brain Storm Optimization Based Swarm Learning for Diabetic Retinopathy Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of deep learning techniques to medical problems has garnered widespread research interest in recent years, such as applying convolutional neural networks to medical image classification tasks. However, data in the medical field is often highly private, preventing different hospitals from sharing data to train an accurate model. Federated learning, as a privacy-preserving machine learning architecture, has shown promising performance in balancing data privacy and model utility by keeping private data on the client's side and using a central server to coordinate a set of clients for model training through aggregating their uploaded model parameters. Yet, this architecture heavily relies on a trusted third-party server, which is challenging to achieve in real life. Swarm learning, as a specialized decentralized federated learning architecture that does not require a central server, utilizes blockchain technology to enable direct parameter exchanges between clients. However, the mining of blocks requires significant computational resources, limiting its scalability. To address this issue, this paper integrates the brain storm optimization algorithm into the swarm learning framework, named BSO-SL. This approach clusters similar clients into different groups based on their model distributions. Additionally, leveraging the architecture of BSO, clients are given the probability to engage in collaborative learning both within their cluster and with clients outside their cluster, preventing the model from converging to local optima. The proposed method has been validated on a real-world diabetic retinopathy image classification dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation for Learned Image Compression with Supervised Adapters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Learned Image Compression (LIC), a model is trained at encoding and decoding images sampled from a source domain, often outperforming traditional codecs on natural images; yet its performance may be far from optimal on images sampled from different domains. In this work, we tackle the problem of adapting a pre-trained model to multiple target domains by plugging into the decoder an adapter module for each of them, including the source one. Each adapter improves the decoder performance on a specific domain, without the model forgetting about the images seen at training time. A gate network computes the weights to optimally blend the contributions from the adapters when the bitstream is decoded. We experimentally validate our method over two state-of-the-art pre-trained models, observing improved rate-distortion efficiency on the target domains without penalties on the source domain. Furthermore, the gate's ability to find similarities with the learned target domains enables better encoding efficiency also for images outside them.</description>

      <title>Layer Ensemble Averaging for Improving Memristor-Based Artificial Neural Network Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have advanced due to scaling dimensions, but conventional computing faces inefficiency due to the von Neumann bottleneck. In-memory computation architectures, like memristors, offer promise but face challenges due to hardware non-idealities. This work proposes and experimentally demonstrates layer ensemble averaging, a technique to map pre-trained neural network solutions from software to defective hardware crossbars of emerging memory devices and reliably attain near-software performance on inference. The approach is investigated using a custom 20,000-device hardware prototyping platform on a continual learning problem where a network must learn new tasks without catastrophically forgetting previously learned information. Results demonstrate that by trading off the number of devices required for layer mapping, layer ensemble averaging can reliably boost defective memristive network performance up to the software baseline. For the investigated problem, the average multi-task classification accuracy improves from 61 % to 72 % (&lt; 1 % of software baseline) using the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Toward Physics-Aware Deep Learning Architectures for LiDAR Intensity Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) heavily rely on LiDAR perception for environment understanding and navigation. LiDAR intensity provides valuable information about the reflected laser signals and plays a crucial role in enhancing the perception capabilities of AVs. However, accurately simulating LiDAR intensity remains a challenge due to the unavailability of material properties of the objects in the environment, and complex interactions between the laser beam and the environment. The proposed method aims to improve the accuracy of intensity simulation by incorporating physics-based modalities within the deep learning framework. One of the key entities that captures the interaction between the laser beam and the objects is the angle of incidence. In this work we demonstrate that the addition of the LiDAR incidence angle as a separate input to the deep neural networks significantly enhances the results. We present a comparative study between two prominent deep learning architectures: U-NET a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Pix2Pix a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We implemented these two architectures for the intensity prediction task and used SemanticKITTI and VoxelScape datasets for experiments. The comparative analysis reveals that both architectures benefit from the incidence angle as an additional input. Moreover, the Pix2Pix architecture outperforms U-NET, especially when the incidence angle is incorporated.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Compressed Sensing for Joint Hyperspectral Image Transmission and Restoration for CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges associated with hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction from miniaturized satellites, which often suffer from stripe effects and are computationally resource-limited. We propose a Real-Time Compressed Sensing (RTCS) network designed to be lightweight and require only relatively few training samples for efficient and robust HSI reconstruction in the presence of the stripe effect and under noisy transmission conditions. The RTCS network features a simplified architecture that reduces the required training samples and allows for easy implementation on integer-8-based encoders, facilitating rapid compressed sensing for stripe-like HSI, which exactly matches the moderate design of miniaturized satellites on push broom scanning mechanism. This contrasts optimization-based models that demand high-precision floating-point operations, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices. Our encoder employs an integer-8-compatible linear projection for stripe-like HSI data transmission, ensuring real-time compressed sensing. Furthermore, based on the novel two-streamed architecture, an efficient HSI restoration decoder is proposed for the receiver side, allowing for edge-device reconstruction without needing a sophisticated central server. This is particularly crucial as an increasing number of miniaturized satellites necessitates significant computing resources on the ground station. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our approach, offering new and vital capabilities for existing miniaturized satellite systems.</description>

      <title>Mammo-CLIP: Leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for Enhanced Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Multi-view Mammography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although fusion of information from multiple views of mammograms plays an important role to increase accuracy of breast cancer detection, developing multi-view mammograms-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes still faces challenges and no such CAD schemes have been used in clinical practice. To overcome the challenges, we investigate a new approach based on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which has sparked interest across various medical imaging tasks. By solving the challenges in (1) effectively adapting the single-view CLIP for multi-view feature fusion and (2) efficiently fine-tuning this parameter-dense model with limited samples and computational resources, we introduce Mammo-CLIP, the first multi-modal framework to process multi-view mammograms and corresponding simple texts. Mammo-CLIP uses an early feature fusion strategy to learn multi-view relationships in four mammograms acquired from the CC and MLO views of the left and right breasts. To enhance learning efficiency, plug-and-play adapters are added into CLIP image and text encoders for fine-tuning parameters and limiting updates to about 1% of the parameters. For framework evaluation, we assembled two datasets retrospectively. The first dataset, comprising 470 malignant and 479 benign cases, was used for few-shot fine-tuning and internal evaluation of the proposed Mammo-CLIP via 5-fold cross-validation. The second dataset, including 60 malignant and 294 benign cases, was used to test generalizability of Mammo-CLIP. Study results show that Mammo-CLIP outperforms the state-of-art cross-view transformer in AUC (0.841 vs. 0.817, 0.837 vs. 0.807) on both datasets. It also surpasses previous two CLIP-based methods by 20.3% and 14.3%. This study highlights the potential of applying the finetuned vision-language models for developing next-generation, image-text-based CAD schemes of breast cancer.</description>

      <title>HDDGAN: A Heterogeneous Dual-Discriminator Generative Adversarial Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15992</link>

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to preserve thermal radiation information from infrared images while integrating texture details from visible images, enabling the capture of important features and hidden details of subjects in complex scenes and disturbed environments. Consequently, IVIF offers distinct advantages in practical applications such as video surveillance, night navigation, and target recognition. However, prevailing methods often face challenges in simultaneously capturing thermal region features and detailed information due to the disparate characteristics of infrared and visible images. Consequently, fusion outcomes frequently entail a compromise between thermal target area information and texture details. In this study, we introduce a novel heterogeneous dual-discriminator generative adversarial network (HDDGAN) to address this issue. Specifically, the generator is structured as a multi-scale skip-connected structure, facilitating the extraction of essential features from different source images. To enhance the information representation ability of the fusion result, an attention mechanism is employed to construct the information fusion layer within the generator, leveraging the disparities between the source images. Moreover, recognizing the distinct learning requirements of information in infrared and visible images, we design two discriminators with differing structures. This approach aims to guide the model to learn salient information from infrared images while simultaneously capturing detailed information from visible images. Extensive experiments conducted on various public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HDDGAN over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, highlighting its enhanced potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Network Toward Blind Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Blind image restoration (IR) is a common yet challenging problem in computer vision. Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image restoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them. Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise. It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model, we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration. Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks, namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Specialty-Oriented Generalist Medical AI for Chest CT Screening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern medical records include a vast amount of multimodal free text clinical data and imaging data from radiology, cardiology, and digital pathology. Fully mining such big data requires multitasking; otherwise, occult but important aspects may be overlooked, adversely affecting clinical management and population healthcare. Despite remarkable successes of AI in individual tasks with single-modal data, the progress in developing generalist medical AI remains relatively slow to combine multimodal data for multitasks because of the dual challenges of data curation and model architecture. The data challenge involves querying and curating multimodal structured and unstructured text, alphanumeric, and especially 3D tomographic scans on an individual patient level for real-time decisions and on a scale to estimate population health statistics. The model challenge demands a scalable and adaptable network architecture to integrate multimodal datasets for diverse clinical tasks. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind medical multimodal-multitask foundation model (M3FM) with application in lung cancer screening and related tasks. After we curated a comprehensive multimodal multitask dataset consisting of 49 clinical data types including 163,725 chest CT series and 17 medical tasks involved in LCS, we develop a multimodal question-answering framework as a unified training and inference strategy to synergize multimodal information and perform multiple tasks via free-text prompting. M3FM consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art single-modal task-specific models, identifies multimodal data elements informative for clinical tasks and flexibly adapts to new tasks with a small out-of-distribution dataset. As a specialty-oriented generalist medical AI model, M3FM paves the way for similar breakthroughs in other areas of medicine, closing the gap between specialists and the generalist.</description>

      <title>KDAS: Knowledge Distillation via Attention Supervision Framework for Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polyp segmentation, a contentious issue in medical imaging, has seen numerous proposed methods aimed at improving the quality of segmented masks. While current state-of-the-art techniques yield impressive results, the size and computational cost of these models create challenges for practical industry applications. To address this challenge, we present KDAS, a Knowledge Distillation framework that incorporates attention supervision, and our proposed Symmetrical Guiding Module. This framework is designed to facilitate a compact student model with fewer parameters, allowing it to learn the strengths of the teacher model and mitigate the inconsistency between teacher features and student features, a common challenge in Knowledge Distillation, via the Symmetrical Guiding Module. Through extensive experiments, our compact models demonstrate their strength by achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising approach to creating compact models with high accuracy for polyp segmentation and in the medical imaging field. The implementation is available on https://github.com/huyquoctrinh/KDAS.</description>

      <title>UltraLight VM-UNet: Parallel Vision Mamba Significantly Reduces Parameters for Skin Lesion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally for improving the segmentation performance of models, most approaches prefer to use adding more complex modules. And this is not suitable for the medical field, especially for mobile medical devices, where computationally loaded models are not suitable for real clinical environments due to computational resource constraints. Recently, state-space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have become a strong competitor to traditional CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we deeply explore the key elements of parameter influence in Mamba and propose an UltraLight Vision Mamba UNet (UltraLight VM-UNet) based on this. Specifically, we propose a method for processing features in parallel Vision Mamba, named PVM Layer, which achieves excellent performance with the lowest computational load while keeping the overall number of processing channels constant. We conducted comparisons and ablation experiments with several state-of-the-art lightweight models on three skin lesion public datasets and demonstrated that the UltraLight VM-UNet exhibits the same strong performance competitiveness with parameters of only 0.049M and GFLOPs of 0.060. In addition, this study deeply explores the key elements of parameter influence in Mamba, which will lay a theoretical foundation for Mamba to possibly become a new mainstream module for lightweighting in the future.

      <title>Unsupervised Tumor-Aware Distillation for Multi-Modal Brain Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal brain images from MRI scans are widely used in clinical diagnosis to provide complementary information from different modalities. However, obtaining fully paired multi-modal images in practice is challenging due to various factors, such as time, cost, and artifacts, resulting in modality-missing brain images. To address this problem, unsupervised multi-modal brain image translation has been extensively studied. Existing methods suffer from the problem of brain tumor deformation during translation, as they fail to focus on the tumor areas when translating the whole images. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised tumor-aware distillation teacher-student network called UTAD-Net, which is capable of perceiving and translating tumor areas precisely. Specifically, our model consists of two parts: a teacher network and a student network. The teacher network learns an end-to-end mapping from source to target modality using unpaired images and corresponding tumor masks first. Then, the translation knowledge is distilled into the student network, enabling it to generate more realistic tumor areas and whole images without masks. Experiments show that our model achieves competitive performance on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image quality compared with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated images on downstream segmentation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/scut-HC/UTAD-Net.</description>

      <title>Beyond Score Changes: Adversarial Attack on No-Reference Image Quality Assessment from Two Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated impressive success in No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). However, recent researches highlight the vulnerability of NR-IQA models to subtle adversarial perturbations, leading to inconsistencies between model predictions and subjective ratings. Current adversarial attacks, however, focus on perturbing predicted scores of individual images, neglecting the crucial aspect of inter-score correlation relationships within an entire image set. Meanwhile, it is important to note that the correlation, like ranking correlation, plays a significant role in NR-IQA tasks. To comprehensively explore the robustness of NR-IQA models, we introduce a new framework of correlation-error-based attacks that perturb both the correlation within an image set and score changes on individual images. Our research primarily focuses on ranking-related correlation metrics like Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) and prediction error-related metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). As an instantiation, we propose a practical two-stage SROCC-MSE-Attack (SMA) that initially optimizes target attack scores for the entire image set and then generates adversarial examples guided by these scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our SMA method not only significantly disrupts the SROCC to negative values but also maintains a considerable change in the scores of individual images. Meanwhile, it exhibits state-of-the-art performance across metrics with different categories. Our method provides a new perspective on the robustness of NR-IQA models.</description>

      <title>Bracketing Image Restoration and Enhancement with High-Low Frequency Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, due to a series of image degradations, obtaining high-quality, clear content photos is challenging. While significant progress has been made in synthesizing high-quality images, previous methods for image restoration and enhancement often overlooked the characteristics of different degradations. They applied the same structure to address various types of degradation, resulting in less-than-ideal restoration outcomes. Inspired by the notion that high/low frequency information is applicable to different degradations, we introduce HLNet, a Bracketing Image Restoration and Enhancement method based on high-low frequency decomposition. Specifically, we employ two modules for feature extraction: shared weight modules and non-shared weight modules. In the shared weight modules, we use SCConv to extract common features from different degradations. In the non-shared weight modules, we introduce the High-Low Frequency Decomposition Block (HLFDB), which employs different methods to handle high-low frequency information, enabling the model to address different degradations more effectively. Compared to other networks, our method takes into account the characteristics of different degradations, thus achieving higher-quality image restoration.</description>

      <title>DAWN: Domain-Adaptive Weakly Supervised Nuclei Segmentation via Cross-Task Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly supervised segmentation methods have gained significant attention due to their ability to reduce the reliance on costly pixel-level annotations during model training. However, the current weakly supervised nuclei segmentation approaches typically follow a two-stage pseudo-label generation and network training process. The performance of the nuclei segmentation heavily relies on the quality of the generated pseudo-labels, thereby limiting its effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel domain-adaptive weakly supervised nuclei segmentation framework using cross-task interaction strategies to overcome the challenge of pseudo-label generation. Specifically, we utilize weakly annotated data to train an auxiliary detection task, which assists the domain adaptation of the segmentation network. To enhance the efficiency of domain adaptation, we design a consistent feature constraint module integrating prior knowledge from the source domain. Furthermore, we develop pseudo-label optimization and interactive training methods to improve the domain transfer capability. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive comparative and ablation experiments on six datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing weakly supervised approaches. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable or even better performance than fully supervised methods. Our code will be released in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/DAWN.</description>
