      <title>Autoregressive Enzyme Function Prediction with Multi-scale Multi-modality Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzyme function is crucial for elucidating biological mechanisms and driving innovation across various sectors. Existing deep learning methods tend to rely solely on either sequence data or structural data and predict the EC number as a whole, neglecting the intrinsic hierarchical structure of EC numbers. To address these limitations, we introduce MAPred, a novel multi-modality and multi-scale model designed to autoregressively predict the EC number of proteins. MAPred integrates both the primary amino acid sequence and the 3D tokens of proteins, employing a dual-pathway approach to capture comprehensive protein characteristics and essential local functional sites. Additionally, MAPred utilizes an autoregressive prediction network to sequentially predict the digits of the EC number, leveraging the hierarchical organization of EC classifications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including New-392, Price, and New-815, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models, marking a significant advance in the reliability and granularity of protein function prediction within bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>Design Proteins Using Large Language Models: Enhancements and Comparative Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained LLMs have demonstrated substantial capabilities across a range of conventional natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as summarization and entity recognition. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs in the generation of high-quality protein sequences. Specifically, we adopt a suite of pre-trained LLMs, including Mistral-7B1, Llama-2-7B2, Llama-3-8B3, and gemma-7B4, to produce valid protein sequences. All of these models are publicly available.5 Unlike previous work in this field, our approach utilizes a relatively small dataset comprising 42,000 distinct human protein sequences. We retrain these models to process protein-related data, ensuring the generation of biologically feasible protein structures. Our findings demonstrate that even with limited data, the adapted models exhibit efficiency comparable to established protein-focused models such as ProGen varieties, ProtGPT2, and ProLLaMA, which were trained on millions of protein sequences. To validate and quantify the performance of our models, we conduct comparative analyses employing standard metrics such as pLDDT, RMSD, TM-score, and REU. Furthermore, we commit to making the trained versions of all four models publicly available, fostering greater transparency and collaboration in the field of computational biology.</description>

      <title>PhaGO: Protein function annotation for bacteriophages by integrating the genomic context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria, playing a crucial role in microbial ecology. Phage proteins are important in understanding phage biology, such as virus infection, replication, and evolution. Although a large number of new phages have been identified via metagenomic sequencing, many of them have limited protein function annotation. Accurate function annotation of phage proteins presents several challenges, including their inherent diversity and the scarcity of annotated ones. Existing tools have yet to fully leverage the unique properties of phages in annotating protein functions. In this work, we propose a new protein function annotation tool for phages by leveraging the modular genomic structure of phage genomes. By employing embeddings from the latest protein foundation models and Transformer to capture contextual information between proteins in phage genomes, PhaGO surpasses state-of-the-art methods in annotating diverged proteins and proteins with uncommon functions by 6.78% and 13.05% improvement, respectively. PhaGO can annotate proteins lacking homology search results, which is critical for characterizing the rapidly accumulating phage genomes. We demonstrate the utility of PhaGO by identifying 688 potential holins in phages, which exhibit high structural conservation with known holins. The results show the potential of PhaGO to extend our understanding of newly discovered phages.</description>

      <title>All the single cells: single-cell transcriptomics/epigenomics experimental design and analysis considerations for glial biologists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, and other 'omics applied at single-cell resolution can significantly advance hypotheses and understanding of glial biology. Omics technologies are revealing a large and growing number of new glial cell subtypes, defined by their gene expression profile. These subtypes have significant implications for understanding glial cell function, cell-cell communications, and glia-specific changes between homeostasis and conditions such as neurological disease. For many, the training in how to analyze, interpret, and understand these large datasets has been through reading and understanding literature from other fields like biostatistics. Here, we provide a primer for glial biologists on experimental design and analysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Our goal is to further the understanding of why decisions might be made about datasets and to enhance biologists' ability to interpret and critique their work and the work of others. We review the steps involved in single-cell analysis with a focus on decision points and particular notes for glia. The goal of this primer is to ensure that single-cell 'omics experiments continue to advance glial biology in a rigorous and replicable way.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Analysis of White Blood Cell Differentiation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients using a \beta-Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical imaging and RNA sequencing with single-cell resolution improves our understanding of white blood cell diseases like leukemia. By combining morphological and transcriptomic data, we can gain insights into cellular functions and trajectoriess involved in blood cell differentiation. However, existing methodologies struggle with integrating morphological and transcriptomic data, leaving a significant research gap in comprehensively understanding the dynamics of cell differentiation. Here, we introduce an unsupervised method that explores and reconstructs these two modalities and uncovers the relationship between different subtypes of white blood cells from human peripheral blood smears in terms of morphology and their corresponding transcriptome. Our method is based on a beta-variational autoencoder (\beta-VAE) with a customized loss function, incorporating a R-CNN architecture to distinguish single-cell from background and to minimize any interference from artifacts. This implementation of \beta-VAE shows good reconstruction capability along with continuous latent embeddings, while maintaining clear differentiation between single-cell classes. Our novel approach is especially helpful to uncover the correlation of two latent features in complex biological processes such as formation of granules in the cell (granulopoiesis) with gene expression patterns. It thus provides a unique tool to improve the understanding of white blood cell maturation for biomedicine and diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Forecasting and predicting stochastic agent-based model data with biologically-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective migration is an important component of many biological processes, including wound healing, tumorigenesis, and embryo development. Spatial agent-based models (ABMs) are often used to model collective migration, but it is challenging to thoroughly predict these models' behavior throughout parameter space due to their random and computationally intensive nature. Modelers often coarse-grain ABM rules into mean-field differential equation (DE) models. While these DE models are fast to simulate, they suffer from poor (or even ill-posed) ABM predictions in some regions of parameter space. In this work, we describe how biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) can be trained to learn interpretable BINN-guided DE models capable of accurately predicting ABM behavior. In particular, we show that BINN-guided partial DE (PDE) simulations can 1.) forecast future spatial ABM data not seen during model training, and 2.) predict ABM data at previously-unexplored parameter values. This latter task is achieved by combining BINN-guided PDE simulations with multivariate interpolation. We demonstrate our approach using three case study ABMs of collective migration that imitate cell biology experiments and find that BINN-guided PDEs accurately forecast and predict ABM data with a one-compartment PDE when the mean-field PDE is ill-posed or requires two compartments. This work suggests that BINN-guided PDEs allow modelers to efficiently explore parameter space, which may enable data-driven tasks for ABMs, such as estimating parameters from experimental data. All code and data from our study is available at https://github.com/johnnardini/Forecasting_predicting_ABMs.</description>

      <title>RawHash2: Mapping Raw Nanopore Signals Using Hash-Based Seeding and Adaptive Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05771v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Summary: Raw nanopore signals can be analyzed while they are being generated, a process known as real-time analysis. Real-time analysis of raw signals is essential to utilize the unique features that nanopore sequencing provides, enabling the early stopping of the sequencing of a read or the entire sequencing run based on the analysis. The state-of-the-art mechanism, RawHash, offers the first hash-based efficient and accurate similarity identification between raw signals and a reference genome by quickly matching their hash values. In this work, we introduce RawHash2, which provides major improvements over RawHash, including a more sensitive quantization and chaining implementation, weighted mapping decisions, frequency filters to reduce ambiguous seed hits, minimizers for hash-based sketching, and support for the R10.4 flow cell version and various data formats such as POD5 and SLOW5. Compared to RawHash, RawHash2 provides better F1 accuracy (on average by 10.57% and up to 20.25%) and better throughput (on average by 4.0x and up to 9.9x) than RawHash. Availability and Implementation: RawHash2 is available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/RawHash. We also provide the scripts to fully reproduce our results on our GitHub page.</description>

      <title>Can virtual staining for high-throughput screening generalize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large volume and variety of imaging data from high-throughput screening (HTS) in the pharmaceutical industry present an excellent resource for training virtual staining models. However, the potential of models trained under one set of experimental conditions to generalize to other conditions remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates whether data from three cell types (lung, ovarian, and breast) and two phenotypes (toxic and non-toxic conditions) commonly found in HTS can effectively train virtual staining models to generalize across three typical HTS distribution shifts: unseen phenotypes, unseen cell types, and the combination of both. Utilizing a dataset of 772,416 paired bright-field, cytoplasm, nuclei, and DNA-damage stain images, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of models across pixel-based, instance-wise, and biological-feature-based levels. Our findings indicate that training virtual nuclei and cytoplasm models on non-toxic condition samples not only generalizes to toxic condition samples but leads to improved performance across all evaluation levels compared to training on toxic condition samples. Generalization to unseen cell types shows variability depending on the cell type; models trained on ovarian or lung cell samples often perform well under other conditions, while those trained on breast cell samples consistently show poor generalization. Generalization to unseen cell types and phenotypes shows good generalization across all levels of evaluation compared to addressing unseen cell types alone. This study represents the first large-scale, data-centric analysis of the generalization capability of virtual staining models trained on diverse HTS datasets, providing valuable strategies for experimental training data generation.</description>
