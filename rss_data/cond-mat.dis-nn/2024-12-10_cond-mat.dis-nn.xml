      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Support Vector Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key problem in deep learning and computational neuroscience is relating the geometrical properties of neural representations to task performance. Here, we consider this problem for continuous decoding tasks where neural variability may affect task precision. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we study the average-case learning curves for $\varepsilon$-insensitive Support Vector Regression ($\varepsilon$-SVR) and discuss its capacity as a measure of linear decodability. Our analysis reveals a phase transition in the training error at a critical load, capturing the interplay between the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$ and neural variability. We uncover a double-descent phenomenon in the generalization error, showing that $\varepsilon$ acts as a regularizer, both suppressing and shifting these peaks. Theoretical predictions are validated both on toy models and deep neural networks, extending the theory of Support Vector Machines to continuous tasks with inherent neural variability.</description>

      <title>Scalable Training of Neural Network Potentials for Complex Interfaces Through Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial neural network (ANN) potentials enable highly accurate atomistic simulations of complex materials at unprecedented scales. Despite their promise, training ANN potentials to represent intricate potential energy surfaces (PES) with transferability to diverse chemical environments remains computationally intensive, especially when atomic force data are incorporated to improve PES gradients. Here, we present an efficient ANN potential training methodology that uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) to incorporate atomic forces into ANN training, leading to accurate PES models with fewer additional first-principles calculations and a reduced computational effort for training. Our GPR-ANN approach generates synthetic energy data from force information in the reference dataset, thus augmenting the training datasets and bypassing direct force training. Benchmark tests on hybrid density-functional theory data for ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules and Li metal-EC interfaces, relevant for lithium metal battery applications, demonstrate that GPR-ANN potentials achieve accuracies comparable to fully force-trained ANNs with a significantly reduced computational overhead. Detailed comparisons show that the method improves both data efficiency and scalability for complex interfaces and heterogeneous environments. This work establishes the GPR-ANN method as a powerful and scalable framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning interatomic potentials, offering the computational and memory efficiency critical for the large-scale simulations needed for the simulation of materials interfaces.</description>

      <title>No Free Lunch From Random Feature Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a budget on total model size, one must decide whether to train a single, large neural network or to combine the predictions of many smaller networks. We study this trade-off for ensembles of random-feature ridge regression models. We prove that when a fixed number of trainable parameters are partitioned among $K$ independently trained models, $K=1$ achieves optimal performance, provided the ridge parameter is optimally tuned. We then derive scaling laws which describe how the test risk of an ensemble of regression models decays with its total size. We identify conditions on the kernel and task eigenstructure under which ensembles can achieve near-optimal scaling laws. Training ensembles of deep convolutional neural networks on CIFAR-10 and a transformer architecture on C4, we find that a single large network outperforms any ensemble of networks with the same total number of parameters, provided the weight decay and feature-learning strength are tuned to their optimal values.</description>

      <title>Frontier orbitals control dynamical disorder in molecular semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge transport in organic semiconductors is limited by dynamical disorder. Design rules for new high-mobility materials have therefore focused on limiting its two foundations: structural fluctuations and the transfer integral gradient. However, it has remained unclear how these goals should be translated into molecular structures. Here we show that a specific shape of the frontier orbital, with a lack of nodes along the long molecular axis, reduces the transfer integral gradient and therefore the dynamical disorder. We investigated single crystals of the prototypical molecular semiconductors pentacene and picene by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and dynamical disorder calculations. We found that picene exhibits a remarkably low dynamical disorder. By separating in- and out-of-plane components of dynamical disorder, we identify the reason as a reduced out-of-plane disorder from a small transfer integral derivative. Our results demonstrate that molecules with an armchair $\pi$-electron topology and same-phase frontier orbitals like picene are promising molecular building blocks for the next generation of organic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Topology of Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces a variety of open quantum phenomena that have no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators within the 38-fold way, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as anomalous boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, constituting the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition at complex energies in one-dimensional parity-time-symmetric disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of disorder can severely impede wave transport, resulting in the famous Anderson localization. Previous theoretical studies found that Anderson transition can exist in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian disordered rings with chiral hopping, defying the scaling theory of localization for Hermitian systems. In these systems, localized (extended) modes are associated with real (complex) energies. Here, we report that Anderson localized modes with complex energies can also exist in such systems. The emergence of the complex-energy localized modes (CELMs) directly ties to the properties of the corresponding pristine non-Hermitian system. Specifically, the density of states of the complex spectrum under the periodic boundary condition and the non-Bloch parity-time transition of the open-boundary chain both play critical roles in the emergence of the CELMs. The coexistence of extended modes, real-energy localized modes (RELMs), and CELMs should be a generic phenomenon for 1D non-Hermitian disordered systems under class AI. Our work shows that the interplay between Anderson mechanism and non-Hermitian physics enriches the properties of disordered media and opens new possibilities for controlling wave transport.</description>

      <title>Instabilities govern the low-frequency vibrational spectrum of amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous solids exhibit an excess of low-frequency vibrational modes beyond the Debye prediction, contributing to their anomalous mechanical and thermal properties. Although a $\omega^4$ power-law scaling is often proposed for the distribution of these modes, the precise exponent remains a subject of debate. In this study, we demonstrate that boundary-condition-induced instabilities play a key role in this variability. We identify two distinct types of elastic branches that differ in the nature of their energy landscape: Fictitious branches, where shear minima cannot be reached through elastic deformation alone and require plastic instabilities, and True branches, where elastic deformation can access these minima. Configurations on Fictitious branches show a vibrational density of states (VDoS) scaling as $D(\omega) \sim \omega^3$, while those on True elastic branches under simple and pure shear deformations exhibit a scaling of $D(\omega) \sim \omega^{5.5}$. Ensemble averaging over both types of branches results in a VDoS scaling of $D(\omega) \sim \omega^4$. Additionally, solids relaxed to their shear minima, with no residual shear stress, display a steeper scaling of $D(\omega) \sim \omega^{6.5}$ in both two and three dimensions. We propose two limiting behaviors for amorphous solids: if the system size is increased without addressing instabilities, the low-frequency VDoS scales with an exponent close to $3$. Conversely, by removing residual shear stress before considering large system sizes, the VDoS scales as $D(\omega) \sim \omega^{6.5}$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum sensitivity and coherence of symmetric magnetic clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for highly coherent degrees of freedom in noisy solid-state environments is a major challenge in condensed matter. In disordered dipolar systems, such as magnetically doped insulators, compact clusters of two-level systems (TLS) have recently been shown to have significantly longer coherence times than typical single TLS. Coupling weakly to their environment, they sense and probe its many-body dynamics through the induced dephasing. However, it has remained an open question whether further mechanisms exist that protect the coherence of such solid-state qubits. Here we show that symmetric clusters of few TLS couple even more weakly to their surroundings, making them highly sensitive quantum sensors of slow many-body dynamics. Furthermore, we explore their use as qubits for quantum information storage, detailing the techniques required for their preparation and manipulation. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry in enhancing quantum coherence in disordered and noisy systems, opening a route toward a sensitive experimental probe of many-body quasi-localization dynamics as well as the development of quantum technologies in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P&gt;0.9998$) classify a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. Further, within these regimes we demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.</description>

      <title>What makes it possible to learn probability distributions in the natural world?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organisms and algorithms learn probability distributions from previous observations, either over evolutionary time or on the fly. In the absence of regularities, estimating the underlying distribution from data would require observing each possible outcome many times. Here we show that two conditions allow us to escape this infeasible requirement. First, the mutual information between two halves of the system should be consistently sub-extensive. Second, this shared information should be compressible, so that it can be represented by a number of bits proportional to the information rather than to the entropy. Under these conditions, a distribution can be described with a number of parameters that grows linearly with system size. These conditions are borne out in natural images and in models from statistical physics, respectively.</description>

      <title>Critical Properties of Weak Measurement Induced Phase Transitions in Random Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of different forms of weak measurements on the nature of the measurement induced phase transition are theoretically studied in hybrid random quantum circuits of qubits. We use a combination of entanglement measures, ancilla purification dynamics, and a transfer matrix approach to compute the critical exponents, the effective central charge, and the multifractal spectrum of the measurement induced transitions. We compare weak measurements with an infinite number of discrete outcomes to a protocol with only a pair of outcomes and find that to within our numerical accuracy the universal critical properties are unaffected by the weak measurement protocols and are consistent with the universality class found for strong projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Interplay of Attention Paths in a Statistical Mechanics Theory of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical performance of Transformers, their theoretical understanding remains elusive. Here, we consider a deep multi-head self-attention network, that is closely related to Transformers yet analytically tractable. We develop a statistical mechanics theory of Bayesian learning in this model, deriving exact equations for the network's predictor statistics under the finite-width thermodynamic limit, i.e., $N,P\rightarrow\infty$, $P/N=\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $N$ is the network width and $P$ is the number of training examples. Our theory shows that the predictor statistics are expressed as a sum of independent kernels, each one pairing different 'attention paths', defined as information pathways through different attention heads across layers. The kernels are weighted according to a 'task-relevant kernel combination' mechanism that aligns the total kernel with the task labels. As a consequence, this interplay between attention paths enhances generalization performance. Experiments confirm our findings on both synthetic and real-world sequence classification tasks. Finally, our theory explicitly relates the kernel combination mechanism to properties of the learned weights, allowing for a qualitative transfer of its insights to models trained via gradient descent. As an illustration, we demonstrate an efficient size reduction of the network, by pruning those attention heads that are deemed less relevant by our theory.</description>

      <title>How transformers learn structured data: insights from hierarchical filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the learning process and the embedded computation in transformers is becoming a central goal for the development of interpretable AI. In the present study, we introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for generative models of sequences on trees, allowing us to hand-tune the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformers can approximate the exact inference algorithm when trained on root classification and masked language modeling tasks, and study how this computation is discovered and implemented. We find that correlations at larger distances, corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy, are sequentially included by the network during training. Moreover, by comparing attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering and by probing the different encoder levels, we find clear evidence of a reconstruction of correlations on successive length scales corresponding to the various levels of the hierarchy, which we relate to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm within the same architecture.</description>

      <title>Fragility of Chess positions: measure, universality and tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel metric to quantify the fragility of chess positions using the interaction graph of pieces. This fragility score $F$ captures the tension within a position and serves as a strong indicator of tipping points in a game. In well-known games, maximum fragility often aligns with decisive moments marked by brilliant moves. Analyzing a large dataset of games, we find that fragility typically peaks around move $15$, with pawns ($\approx 60\%$) and knights ($\approx 20\%$) frequently involved in high-tension positions. Comparing the Stockfish evaluation with the fragility score, we observe that the maximum fragility ply often serves as a critical turning point, where the moves made afterward can determine the outcome of the game. Remarkably, average fragility curves show a universal pattern across a wide range of players, games, and openings, with a subtle deviation observed in games played by the engine Stockfish. Our analysis reveals a gradual buildup of fragility starting around $8$ moves before the peak, followed by a prolonged fragile state lasting up to $15$ moves. This suggests a gradual intensification of positional tension leading to decisive moments in the game. These insights offer a valuable tool for both players and engines to assess critical moments in chess.</description>

Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>
