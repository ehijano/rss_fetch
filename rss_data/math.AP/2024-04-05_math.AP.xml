      <title>On the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the steady Navier-Stokes system in two-dimensional channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the incompressible steady Navier-Stokes system with no-slip boundary condition in a two-dimensional channel. Given any flux, the existence of solutions is proved as long as the width of cross-section of the channel grows more slowly than the linear growth. Furthermore, if the flux is suitably small, the solution is unique even when the width of the channel is unbounded. Finally, based on the estimate of Dirichlet norm on the truncated domain, one could obtain the pointwise decay rate of the solution for arbitrary flux.</description>

      <title>Relaxation for degenerate nonlinear functionals in the onedimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we approach the analysis of a degenerate nonlinear functional in one dimension, accommodating a degenerate weight w. Building upon recent findings from [9, 12], our investigation focuses on establishing an explicit relaxation formula for a functional exhibiting p-growth for $1\leq p&lt;+\infty$. For the case $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, we adopt the approach developed in [12], where some assumptions like doubling or Muckenhoupt conditions are dropped. Moreover, for $p = 1$, we leverage novel concepts introduced in [9]. In both cases, our main tools consist of proving the validity of a weighted Poincar\'e inequality involving an auxiliary weight.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Convex Solutions to Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Systems: Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the monotonic and symmetric properties of convex solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic systems. We mainly discuss Monge-Amp\`ere type systems for instance, considering
  \begin{equation*}
  \det(D^2u^i)=f^i(x,{\bf u},\nabla u^i), \ 1\leq i\leq m,
  \end{equation*} over bounded domains of various cases, including the bounded smooth simply connected domains and bounded tube shape domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We obtain monotonic and symmetric properties of the solutions to the problem with respect to the geometry of domains and the monotonic and symmetric properties of right-hand side terms. The proof is based on carefully using the moving plane method together with various maximum principles and Hopf's lemmas. The existence and uniqueness to an interesting example of such system is also discussed as an application of our results.</description>

      <title>Singular solutions for complex second order elliptic equations and their application to time-harmonic diffuse optical tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct singular solutions of a complex elliptic equation of second order, having an isolated singularity of any order. In particular, we extend results obtained for the real partial differential equation in divergence form by Alessandrini in 1990. Our solutions can be applied to the determination of the optical properties of an anisotropic medium in time-harmonic Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT).</description>

      <title>Oscillatory free boundary problems in stochastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of free boundary problems with oscillatory singularities within stochastic materials. Our main result yields sharp regularity estimates along the free boundary, provided the power of the singularity varies in a Dini-continuous fashion below a certain threshold. We also reveal an interesting repelling estimate preventing the free boundary from touching the region where the singularity power oscillates above the threshold.</description>

      <title>The Diffusive Ultrasound Modulated Bioluminescence Tomography with Partial Data and Uncertain Optical Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies an imaging problem in the diffusive ultrasound-modulated bioluminescence tomography with partial boundary measurement in an anisotropic medium. Assuming plane-wave modulation, we transform the imaging problem to an inverse problem with internal data, and derive a reconstruction procedure to recover the bioluminescent source. Subsequently, an uncertainty quantification estimate is established to assess the robustness of the reconstruction. To facilitate practical implementation, we discretize the diffusive model using the staggered grid scheme, resulting in a discrete formulation of the UMBLT inverse problem. A discrete reconstruction procedure is then presented along with a discrete uncertainty quantification estimate. Finally, the reconstruction procedure is quantitatively validated through numerical examples to demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed approach and estimates.</description>

      <title>Results of existence and uniqueness for the Cauchy problem of semilinear heat equations on stratified Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give existence and uniqueness results for solutions of the Cauchy problem for semilinear heat equations on stratified Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ with the homogeneous dimension $N$. We consider the nonlinear function behaves like $|u|^{\alpha}$ or $|u|^{\alpha-1}u$ $(\alpha&gt;1)$ and the initial data $u_0$ belongs to the Sobolev spaces $L^p_s(\mathbb{G})$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $0&lt;s&lt;N/p$. Since stratified Lie groups $\mathbb{G}$ include the Euclidean space ${\mathbb R}^n$ as an example, our results are an extension of the existence and uniqueness results obtained by F. Ribaud on ${\mathbb R}^n$ to $\mathbb{G}$. It should be noted that our proof is very different from it given by Ribaud on ${\mathbb R}^n$. We adopt the generalized fractional chain rule on $\mathbb{G}$ to obtain the estimate for the nonlinear term, which is very different from the paracomposition technique adopted by Ribaud on ${\mathbb R}^n$. By using the generalized fractional chain rule on $\mathbb{G}$, we can avoid the discussion of Fourier analysis on $\mathbb{G}$ and make the proof more simple.</description>

      <title>Stabilization in two-species chemotaxis systems with singular sensitivity and Lotka-Volterra competitive kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current paper is concerned with the stabilization in the following parabolic-parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and Lotka-Volterra competitive kinetics, \begin{equation} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi_1 \nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{w} \nabla w)+u(a_1-b_1u-c_1v) ,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega\cr v_t=\Delta v-\chi_2 \nabla\cdot (\frac{v}{w} \nabla w)+v(a_2-b_2v-c_2u),\quad &amp;x\in \Omega\cr 0=\Delta w-\mu w +\nu u+ \lambda v,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial w}{\partial n}=0,\quad &amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded smooth domain, and $\chi_i,a_i, b_i, c_i$ ($i=1,2$) and $\mu,\, \nu, \, \lambda$ are positive constants. In [25], we proved that for any given nonnegative initial data $u_0,v_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0+v_0\not \equiv 0$, (0.1) has a unique globally defined classical solution provided that $\min\{a_1,a_2\}$ is large relative to $\chi_1,\chi_2$, and $u_0+v_0$ is not small in the case that $(\chi_1-\chi_2)^2\le \max\{4\chi_1,4\chi_2\}$ and $u_0+v_0$ is neither small nor big in the case that $(\chi_1-\chi_2)^2&gt;\max\{4\chi_1,4\chi_2\}$. In this paper, we proved that (0.1) has a unique positive constant solution $(u^*,v^*,w^*)$, where $$ u^*=\frac{a_1b_2-c_1a_2}{b_1b_2-c_1c_2},\quad v^*=\frac{b_1a_2-a_1c_2}{b_1b_2-c_1c_2}, \quad w^*=\frac{\nu}{\mu}u^*+\frac{\lambda}{\mu} v^*. $$ We obtain some explicit conditions on $\chi_1,\chi_2$ which ensure that the positive constant solution $(u^*,v^*,w^*)$ is globally stable in the sense that for any given nonnegative initial data $u_0,v_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0\not \equiv 0$ and $v_0\not \equiv 0$, $$ \lim_{t\to\infty}\Big(\|u(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)-u^*\|_\infty +\|v(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)-v^*\|_\infty+\|w(t,\cdot;u_0,v_0)-w^*\|_\infty\Big)=0. $$</description>

      <title>Blow up analysis for a parabolic MEMS problem, I: H\"{o}lder estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of papers devoted to the blow up analysis for the quenching phenomena in a parabolic MEMS equation. In this paper, we first give an optimal H\"{o}lder estimate for solutions to this equation by using the blow up method and some Liouville theorems on stationary two-valued caloric functions, and then establish a convergence theory for sequences of uniformly H\"{o}lder continuous solutions. These results are also used to prove a stratification theorem on the rupture set $\{u=0\}$.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of the stress in presence of closely located inclusions with imperfect bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If two conducting or insulating inclusions are closely located, the gradient of the solution may become arbitrarily large as the distance between inclusions tends to zero, resulting in high concentration of stress in between two inclusions. This happens if the bonding of the inclusions and the matrix is perfect, meaning that the potential and flux are continuous across the interface. In this paper, we consider the case when the bonding is imperfect. We consider the case when there are two circular inclusions of the same radii with the imperfect bonding interfaces and prove that the gradient of the solution is bounded regardless of the distance between inclusions if the bonding parameter is finite. This result is of particular importance since the imperfect bonding interface condition is an approximation of the membrane structure of biological inclusions such as biological cells.</description>

      <title>On the derivation of the linear Boltzmann equation from the nonideal Rayleigh gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper's objective is to improve the existing proof of the derivation of the Rayleigh--Boltzmann equation from the nonideal Rayleigh gas [6], yielding a far faster convergence rate. This equation is a linear version of the Boltzmann equation, describing the behavior of a small fraction of tagged particles having been perturbed from thermodynamic equilibrium. This linear equation, derived from the microscopic Newton laws as suggested by the Hilbert's sixth problem, is much better understood than the quadratic Boltzmann equation, and even enable results on long time scales for the kinetic description of gas dynamics.The present paper improves the physically poor convergence rate that had been previously proved, into a much more satisfactory rate which is more than exponentially better.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the uniform null controllability problem for a system of coupled parabolic equations with an oscillating coefficient. This is done in three steps -- first, we study the spectral properties of an elliptic operator; second, we allow the system to evolve freely and obtain the required decay; third, we use a Carleman estimate to prove a suitable observability result. This uniform null controllability property is then used to homogenize the associated coupled parabolic system.</description>

      <title>Weighted Energy-Dissipation approach to semilinear gradient flows with state-dependent dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Weighted Energy-Dissipation variational approach to semilinear gradient flows with state-dependent dissipation. A family of parameter-dependent functionals defined over entire trajectories is introduced and proved to admit global minimizers. These global minimizers correspond to solutions of elliptic-in-time regularizations of the limiting causal problem. By passing to the limit in the parameter we prove that such global minimizers converge, up to subsequences, to a solution of the gradient flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness and ill-posedness issues for the incompressible stationary Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (Hall-MHD) system in $\mathbb{R}^3.$ We first show the existence and uniqueness of solutions provided with the forces in $\dot B^{3/p-3}_{p,r}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for $1\leq p &lt;3$ and $r=1$. Moreover, this result can be extended to any $1\leq r\leq \infty$ whenever $p=2,$ without any additional assumption on the physical parameters. On the other hand, we establish some ill-posedness results for Hall-MHD system by using the discontinuity of the solution mapping of the three-dimensional stationary Navier-Stokes equations in \emph{critical} function spaces $\dot{B}^{3/p-1}_{p,r}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ ($p\geq 3$).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the equation \[ -\Delta u +(\log |\cdot|*|u|^2)u=(\log|\cdot|*|u|^q)|u|^{q-2}u, \qquad \hbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^2, \] where $8/3 &lt; q &lt; 4$. By means of variational arguments, we find infinitely many radially symmetric classical solutions. The main difficulties rely on the competition between the two nonlocal terms and on the presence of logarithmic kernels, which have not a prescribed sign. In addition, in order to find finite energy solutions, a suitable functional setting analysis is required.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a singular convolution potential. It demonstrates the local well-posedness of this equation in a modified Sobolev space linked to the energy. Additionally, we derive conditions under which the solutions are uniformly bounded in the energy space. This finding is closely linked to the existence of standing waves for this equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss existence and finite speed of propagation for the solutions to an initial-boundary value problem for a family of fractional thin-film equations in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The nonlocal operator we consider is the spectral fractional Laplacian with Neumann boundary conditions. In the case of a "strong slippage" regime with "complete wetting" interfacial conditions, we prove local entropy estimates that entail finite speed of propagation of the support and a lower bound for the waiting time phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A High Order Solver for Signature Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signature kernels are at the core of several machine learning algorithms for analysing multivariate time series. The kernel of two bounded variation paths (such as piecewise linear interpolations of time series data) is typically computed by solving a Goursat problem for a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) in two independent time variables. However, this approach becomes considerably less practical for highly oscillatory input paths, as they have to be resolved at a fine enough scale to accurately recover their signature kernel, resulting in significant time and memory complexities. To mitigate this issue, we first show that the signature kernel of a broader class of paths, known as \emph{smooth rough paths}, also satisfies a PDE, albeit in the form of a system of coupled equations. We then use this result to introduce new algorithms for the numerical approximation of signature kernels. As bounded variation paths (and more generally geometric $p$-rough paths) can be approximated by piecewise smooth rough paths, one can replace the PDE with rapidly varying coefficients in the original Goursat problem by an explicit system of coupled equations with piecewise constant coefficients derived from the first few iterated integrals of the original input paths. While this approach requires solving more equations, they do not require looking back at the complex and fine structure of the initial paths, which significantly reduces the computational complexity associated with the analysis of highly oscillatory time series.</description>

Abstract: We prove existence and uniqueness of   solutions of a semilinear PDE driven by a Bessel type generator$L^\delta$  with low dimension $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$. $L^\delta$ is a local operator, whose drift is thederivative of $x \mapsto \log (\vert x\vert)$:in particular it is a Schwartz distribution, whichis not the derivative of a continuous function.The solutions  are intended in a duality (''weak'') sensewith respect to state space$L^2(\mathbb{R}_+, d\mu),$ $\mu$ being an invariant measure for the Bessel semigroup.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problems, Toeplitz operators and ergosurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach, in conjunction with the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices, enables one to obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories. These solutions are encoded in the elements of a matrix $M$ depending on the Weyl coordinates $\rho$ and $v$, determined by that factorisation. We address here, for the first time, the underlying question of what happens when a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation does not exist, using the close connection of Wiener-Hopf factorisation with Toeplitz operators to study this question. For the case of rational monodromy matrices, we prove that the non-existence of a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation determines curves in the $(\rho,v)$ plane on which some elements of $M(\rho,v)$ tend to infinity, but where the space-time metric may still be well behaved. In the case of uncharged rotating black holes in four space-time dimensions and, for certain choices of coordinates, in five space-time dimensions, we show that these curves correspond to their ergosurfaces.</description>

      <title>Curves in the Fourier zeros of polytopal regions and the Pompeiu problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any finite union $P$ of interior-disjoint polytopes in ${\mathbb R}^d$ has the Pompeiu property, a result first proved by Williams [Wil76]. This means that if a continuous function $f$ on $R^d$ integrates to 0 on any congruent copy of $P$ then $f$ is identically 0. By a fundamental result of Brown, Schreiber and Taylor [BST73] this is equivalent to showing that the Fourier-Laplace transform of the indicator function of $P$ does not vanish identically on any 0-centered complex sphere in ${\mathbb C}^d$ . Our proof initially follows the recent one of Machado and Robins [MR23] who are using the Brion-Barvinok formula for the Fourier-Laplace transform of a polytope. But we simplify this method considerably by removing the use of properties of Bessel function zeros. Instead we use some elementary arguments on the growth of linear combinations of exponentials with rational functions as coefficients. Our approach allows us to prove the non-existence of complex spheres of any center in the zero-set of the Fourier-Laplace transform. The planar case is even simpler in that we do not even need the Brion-Barvinok formula. We then go further in the question of which sets can be contained in the null set of the Fourier-Laplace transform of a polytope by extending results of Engel [Eng23] who showed that rationally parametrized hypersurfaces, under some mild conditions, cannot be contained in this null-set. We show that a rationally parametrized curve which is not contained in an affine hyperplane in ${\mathbb C}^d$ cannot be contained in this null-set. Results about curves parametrized by meromorphic functions are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.11000v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any isometric immersion of a flat plane domain into $\mathbb R^3$ is developable provided it enjoys the little H\"older regulairty $c^{1,2/3}$. In particular, isometric immersions of local $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity with $\alpha &gt; 2/3$ belong to this class. The proof is based on the existence of a weak notion of second fundamental form for such immersions, the analysis of the Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations in this weak setting, and a parallel result on the very weak solutions to the degenerate Monge-Amp\`ere equation analyzed by Lewicka and the second author.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limits for kinetic equations preserving mass, momentum and energy: a spectral and unified approach in the presence of a spectral gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triggered by the fact that, in the hydrodynamic limit, several different kinetic equations of physical interest all lead to the same Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, we develop in the paper an abstract framework which allows to explain this phenomenon. The method we develop can be seen as a significant improvement of known approaches for which we fully exploit some structural assumptions on the linear and nonlinear collision operators as well as a good knowledge of the Cauchy theory for the limiting equation. {In particular, we fully exploit the fact that the collision operator is preserving both momentum and kinetic energy.} We adopt a perturbative framework in a Hilbert space setting and first develop a general and fine spectral analysis of the linearized operator and its associated semigroup. Then, we introduce a splitting adapted to the various regimes (kinetic, acoustic, hydrodynamic) present in the kinetic equation which allows, by a fixed point argument, to construct a solution to the kinetic equation and prove the convergence towards suitable solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. Our approach is robust enough to treat, in the same formalism, the case of the Boltzmann equation with hard and moderately soft potentials, with and without cut-off assumptions, as well as the Landau equation for hard and moderately soft potentials in presence of a spectral gap. New well-posedness and strong convergence results are obtained within this framework. In particular, for initial data with algebraic decay with respect to the velocity variable, our approach provides the first result concerning the strong Navier-Stokes limit from Boltzmann equation without Grad cut-off assumption or Landau equation. The method developed in the paper is also robust enough to apply, at least at the linear level, to quantum kinetic equations for Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein particles.</description>

Abstract: These notes recall central elements of the cone calculus. The focus lies on conically degenerate differential operators and the Laplace-Beltrami operator with respect to a conically degenerate metric as a prototypical example. The topics include manifolds with conical singularities, the Mellin transform, cone Sobolev spaces, and the notion of ellipticity in terms of the invertibility of the principal pseudodifferential symbol and the principal Mellin symbol. The notes end with a sketch the full cone calculus.

Abstract: The focus of this paper is the study of the inverse point-source scattering problem, specifically in relation to a certain class of electric potentials. Our research provides a novel uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data, obtained from the near field pattern. Our work improves the work of Caro and Garcia, who investigated both the direct problem and the inverse problem with global near field data for critically singular and $\delta$-shell potentials. The primary contribution of our research is the introduction of a Runge approximation result for the near field data on the scattering problem which, in combination with an interior regularity argument, enables us to establish a uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data. Additionaly, we manage to consider a slightly wider class of potentials.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent work on approximation of diffusion equations by deterministic interacting particle systems, we develop a nonlocal approximation for a range of linear and nonlinear diffusion equations and prove convergence of the method in the slow, linear, and fast diffusion regimes. A key ingredient of our approach is a novel technique for using the 2-Wasserstein and dual Sobolev gradient flow structures of the diffusion equations to recover the duality relation characterizing the pressure in the nonlocal-to-local limit. Due to the general class of internal energy densities that our method is able to handle, a byproduct of our result is a novel particle method for sampling a wide range of probability measures, which extends classical approaches based on the Fokker-Planck equation beyond the log-concave setting.</description>

Abstract: We fill the two main remaining gaps in the full classification of non-degenerate planar traveling waves of scalar balance laws from the point of view of spectral and nonlinear stability/instability under smooth perturbations. On one hand we investigate the impact on the classification of allowing to restrict perturbations by further localization constraints, the so-called convective stability analysis. On the other hand, in the multidimensional case we extend the existing analysis to general perturbations, relaxing the artificial restriction, assumed so far, that initial perturbations are supported away from characteristic points. A striking feature of the latter analysis is that it involves infinite-dimensional families of genuinely multidimensional traveling waves that live near the perturbed planar traveling wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a new general approach for the numerical analysis of stable equilibria to second order  mean field games systems in cases where the uniqueness of solutions may fail. For the sake of simplicity, we focus on a simple stationary case. We propose an abstract framework to study these solutions by reformulating the mean field game system as an abstract equation in a Banach space. In this context, stable equilibria turn out to be regular solutions to this equation, meaning that the linearized system is well-posed. We provide three applications of this property: we study the sensitivity analysis of stable solutions, establish error estimates for their finite element approximations, and prove the local converge of Newton's method in infinite dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We extend the direct approach to the semiclassical asymptotics for Bergman projections, developed by Deleporte--Hitrik--Sj\"ostrand for real analytic exponential weights and Hitrik--Stone for smooth exponential weights, to the case of Gevrey weights. We prove that the amplitude of the asymptotic Bergman projection forms a Gevrey symbol whose asymptotic coefficients obey certain Gevrey-type growth rate, and it is constructed by an asymptotic inversion of an explicit Fourier integral operator up to a Gevrey-type small remainder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of De Giorgi, we consider the Almgren-Taylor-Wang scheme for mean curvature flow, where the volume penalization is replaced by a term of the form \[ \int_{E\Delta F} f\Big(\frac{ {\rm d}_F }{\tau}\Big)~dx \] for $f$ ranging in a large class of strictly increasing continuous functions. In particular, our analysis covers the case \[ f(r) = r^\alpha, \qquad r \geq 0, \quad \alpha&gt;0, \] considered by De Giorgi. We show that the generalized minimizing movement scheme converges to the geometric evolution equation \[ f(v) = - \kappa\quad \text{on $\partial E(t)$,} \] where $\{E(t)\}$ are evolving subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n,$ $v$ is the normal velocity of $\partial E(t),$ and $\kappa$ is the mean curvature of $\partial E(t)$. We extend our analysis to the anisotropic setting, and in the presence of a driving force. We also show that minimizing movements coincide with the smooth classical solution as long as the latter exists. Finally, we prove that in the absence of forcing, mean convexity and convexity are preserved by the weak flow.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibria of the spatially inhomogeneous Vicsek-BGK equation across a bifurcation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vicsek-BGK equation is a kinetic model for alignment of particles moving with constant speed between stochastic reorientation events with sampling from a von Mises distribution. The spatially homogeneous model shows a steady state bifurcation with exchange of stability. The main result of this work is an extension of the bifurcation result to the spatially inhomogeneous problem under the additional assumption of a sufficiently large Knudsen number, which is shown to be necessary. A counterexample is derived in the form of an exponentially increasing travelling wave solution of the linearized equation, indicating a possible explanation of traveling bands, which have been observed in the literature in simulations with an individual based model. The mathematical core is the proof of linearized stability, which employs a new hypocoercivity approach based on Laplace-Fourier transformation. The bifurcation result includes global existence of smooth solutions for close-to-equilibrium initial data. For large data smooth solutions might blow up in finite time whereas weak solutions with bounded Boltzmann entropy are shown to exist globally.</description>

      <title>Rigorous derivation of an effective model for coupled Stokes advection, reaction and diffusion with freely evolving microstructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the homogenisation of a coupled Stokes flow and advection-reaction-diffusion problem in a perforated domain with an evolving microstructure of size $\varepsilon$. Reactions at the boundaries of the microscopic interfaces lead to the formation of a solid layer having a variable, a priori unknown thickness. This results in a growth or shrinkage of the solid phase and, thus, the domain evolution is not known a priori but induced by the advection-reaction-diffusion process. The achievements of this work are the existence and uniqueness of a weak microscopic solution and the rigorous derivation of an effective model for $\varepsilon \to 0$, based on $\varepsilon$-uniform a priori estimates. As a result of the limit passage, the processes on the macroscale are described by an advection-reaction-diffusion problem coupled to Darcy's equation with effective coefficients (porosity, diffusivity and permeability) depending on local cell problems. These local problems are formulated on cells, which depend on the macroscopic position and evolve in time. In particular, the evolution of these cells depends on the macroscopic concentration. Thus, the cell problems (respectively the effective coefficients) are coupled to the macroscopic unknowns and vice versa, leading to a strongly coupled micro-macro model. For pure reactive-diffusive transport coupled with microscopic domain evolution but without advective transport, homogenisation results have recently been presented. We extend these models by advective transport which is driven by the Stokes equation in the a priori unknown evolving pore domain.</description>

      <title>Stability and convergence of in time approximations of hyperbolic elastodynamics via stepwise minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19880v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study step-wise time approximations of non-linear hyperbolic initial value problems. The technique used here is a generalization of the minimizing movements method, using two time-scales: one for velocity, the other (potentially much larger) for acceleration. The main applications are from elastodynamics namely so-called generalized solids, undergoing large deformations. The evolution follows an underlying variational structure exploited by step-wise minimisation.
  We show for a large family of (elastic) energies that the introduced scheme is stable; allowing for non-linearities of highest order. If the highest order can assumed to be linear, we show that the limit solutions are regular and that the minimizing movements scheme converges with optimal linear rate. Thus this work extends numerical time-step minimization methods to the realm of hyperbolic problems.</description>

      <title>Robust time-discretisation and linearisation schemes for singular and degenerate evolution systems modelling biofilm growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse numerical schemes for a system of quasilinear, degenerate evolution equations modelling biofilm growth as well as other processes such as flow through porous media and the spreading of wildfires. The first equation in the system is parabolic and exhibits degenerate and singular diffusion, while the second is either uniformly parabolic or an ordinary differential equation. First, we introduce a semi-implicit time discretisation that has the benefit of decoupling the equations. We prove the positivity, boundedness, and convergence of the time-discrete solutions to the time-continuous solution. Then, we introduce an iterative linearisation scheme to solve the resulting nonlinear time-discrete problems. Under weak assumptions on the time-step size, we prove that the scheme converges irrespective of the space discretisation and mesh. Moreover, if the problem is non-degenerate, the convergence becomes faster as the time-step size decreases. Finally, employing the finite element method for the spatial discretisation, we study the behaviour of the scheme, and compare its performance to other commonly used schemes. These tests confirm that the proposed scheme is robust and fast.</description>
