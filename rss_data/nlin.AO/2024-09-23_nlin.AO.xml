      <title>Self-organized attractoring in locomoting animals and robots: an emerging field</title>

Abstract: Locomotion may be induced on three levels. On a classical level, actuators and limbs follow the sequence of open-loop top-down control signals they receive. Limbs may move alternatively on their own, which implies that interlimb coordination must be mediated either by the body or via decentralized inter-limb signaling. In this case, when embodiment is present, two types of controllers are conceivable for the actuators of the limbs, local pacemaker circuits and control principles based on self-organized embodiment. The latter, self-organized control, is based on limit cycles and chaotic attractors that emerge within the feedback loop composed of controller, body, and environment. For this to happen, the sensorimotor loop must be locally closed, e.g. via propriosensation. Here we review the progress made within the framework of self-organized embodiment, with a particular focus on the concept of attractoring. This concept characterizes situations when sets of attractors combining discrete and continuous spectra are available as motor primitives for higher-order control schemes, such as kick control. In particular, we show that a simple generative principle allows for the robust formulation of self-organized embodiment. Based on the recurrent alternation between measuring the actual status of an actuator and providing a target for the actuator to achieve in the next step, we find that the mechanism leads to compliant locomotion for a range of simulated and real-world robots, which include barrel- and sphere-shaped agents, as well as wheeled and legged robots.</description>

      <title>Metamorphosis of transition to periodic oscillations in a turbulent reactive flow system</title>

Abstract: The emergence of periodic oscillations is observed in various complex systems in nature and engineering. Thermoacoustic oscillations in systems comprising turbulent reactive flow exemplify such complexity in the engineering context, where the emergence of oscillatory dynamics is often undesirable. In this work, we experimentally study the transition to periodic oscillations within a turbulent flow reactive system, with varying fuel-to-air ratio, represented by equivalence ratio as a bifurcation parameter. Further, we explore the change in the nature of the transition by varying a secondary parameter. In our system, we vary the thermal power input and the location of the flame stabilizer position individually as a secondary parameter. Our findings reveal five qualitatively distinct types of transitions to periodic oscillations. Two types of these transitions exhibit a continuous nature. Another two types of transitions involve multiple shifts in the dynamical states consisting of both continuous and discontinuous bifurcations. The last type of transition is characterized by an abrupt bifurcation to high-amplitude periodic oscillations. Understanding this metamorphosis of the transition - from continuous to discontinuous nature - is critical for advancing our comprehension of the dynamic behavior in turbulent reactive flow systems. The insights gained from this study have the potential to inform the design and control of similar engineering systems where managing oscillatory behavior is crucial.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian control to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators with higher-order interactions</title>

Abstract: Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Although it is necessary for the functioning of many systems, too much synchronization can also be detrimental, e.g., (partially) synchronized brain patterns support high-level cognitive processes and bodily control, but hypersynchronization can lead to epileptic seizures and tremors, as in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease.
  Consequently, a critical research question is how to develop effective pinning control methods capable to reduce or modulate synchronization as needed.
  Although such methods exist to control pairwise-coupled oscillators, there are none for higher-order interactions, despite the increasing evidence of their relevant role in brain dynamics.
  In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a generalized control method designed to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators connected through higher-order interactions. Our method embeds a higher-order Kuramoto model into a suitable Hamiltonian flow, and builds up on previous work in Hamiltonian control theory to analytically construct a feedback control mechanism.
  We numerically show that the proposed method effectively prevents synchronization. Although our findings indicate that pairwise contributions in the feedback loop are often sufficient, the higher-order generalization becomes crucial when pairwise coupling is weak. Finally, we explore the minimum number of controlled nodes required to fully desynchronize oscillators coupled via an all-to-all hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-learning relationship in neural networks</title>

Abstract: Learning in neural systems occurs through change in synaptic connectivity that is driven by neural activity. Learning performance is influenced by both neural activity and the task to be learned. Experimental studies suggest a link between learning speed and variability in neural activity before learning. However, the theoretical basis of this relationship has remained unclear. In this work, using principles from the fluctuation-response relation in statistical physics, we derive two formulae that connect neural activity with learning speed. The first formula shows that learning speed is proportional to the variance of spontaneous neural activity and the neural response to input. The second formula, for small input, indicates that speed is proportional to the variances of spontaneous activity in both target and input directions. These formulae apply to various learning tasks governed by Hebbian or generalized learning rules. Numerical simulations confirm that these formulae are valid beyond their theoretical assumptions, even in cases where synaptic connectivity undergoes large changes. Our theory predicts that learning speed increases with the gain of neuronal activation functions and the number of pre-embedded memories, as both enhance the variance of spontaneous neural fluctuations. Additionally, the formulae reveal which input/output relationships are easier to learn, aligning with experimental data. Thus, our results provide a theoretical foundation for the quantitative relationship between pre-learning neural activity fluctuations and learning speed, offering insights into a range of empirical observations.</description>
