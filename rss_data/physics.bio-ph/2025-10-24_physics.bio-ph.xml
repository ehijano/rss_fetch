      <title>Dynamic principles of concentration buffering through liquid-liquid phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems must maintain robust biochemical function despite fluctuations that span a wide range of timescales. Biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been shown to buffer concentration fluctuations, but the principles governing their dynamic regulation remain unclear. We address this by probing the response of LLPS to oscillatory perturbations that mimic fluctuations across different timescales, establishing the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of concentration buffering by condensates. We find that condensates act as frequency-selective filters: the perturbed dilute phase behaves as a high-pass filter, while the dense phase attenuates both low- and high-frequency perturbations. We establish quantitative links between LLPS parameters including interaction strength, droplet size, and molecular diffusivity, and the timescale range over which condensates effectively buffer concentration fluctuations. These findings establish the fundamental dynamical limits of concentration buffering by LLPS, with implications for how cells may use LLPS to adapt to fluctuating environments and for the design of synthetic condensates with programmable control properties.</description>

      <title>Morphological computational capacity of Physarum polycephalum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While computational capacity limits of the universe and carbon-based life have been estimated, a stricter bound for aneural organisms has not been established. Physarum polycephalum, a unicellular, multinucleated amoeba, is capable of complex problem-solving despite lacking neurons. By analyzing growth dynamics in two distinct Physarum strains under diverse biological conditions, we map morphological evolution to information processing. As the Margolus-Levitin theorem constrains maximum computation rates by accessible energies, we analyze high-throughput time-series data of Physarum's morphology--quantified through area, perimeter, circularity, and fractal dimension-to determine upper bounds on the number of logical operations achievable through its hydromechanical, chemical, kinetic, and quantum-optical degrees of freedom. Based on spatial distribution of ATP and explored areas, Physarum can perform up to ~$10^{36}$ logical operations in 24 hours, scaling linearly in the non-equilibrium steady state. This framework enables comparison of the computational capacities of life, exploiting either classical or quantum degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Contrast-enhanced X-ray imaging of articular cartilage: reliability of a cationic contrast agent in combination with high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Articular cartilage showcases distinctive mechanical behaviour, attributable to its biphasic composition and hierarchical organization. Proteoglycans, essential constituents of the extracellular matrix, contribute to tissue swelling, stiffness, and viscoelasticity, thanks to the fixed charge density. Degenerative alterations in proteoglycan content and collagen structure - key indicators of diseases such as osteoarthritis - compromise the mechanical integrity of articular cartilage, underscoring the importance of early detection. Although magnetic resonance imaging provides valuable compositional information, its limited spatial resolution restricts its effectiveness in evaluating thin soft tissues such as articular cartilage. As an alternative, contrast-enhanced X-ray imaging circumvents such limitation, resorting to the use of radiopaque contrast agents. In this context, cationic contrast agents, like CA4+, enable the quantitative assessment of proteoglycan content via electrostatic attraction. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography offers an optimal compromise between spatial resolution and radiation exposure, making it a promising tool for clinical use. This study aimed to explore the relationship between proteoglycan content - quantified through contrast-enhanced high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography combined with the use of CA4+ - and the viscoelastic properties of healthy bovine articular cartilage, assessed via indentation testing. Results highlighted significant correlations between the enhanced radiopacity of articular cartilage, ascribable to the PG content, with parameters representing the mechanical response of the tissue.</description>

      <title>Fitness inference tested by in silico population genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider populations evolving according to natural selection, mutation, and recombination, and assume that the genomes of all or a representative selection of individuals are known. We pose the problem if it is possible to infer fitness parameters and genotype fitness order from such data. We tested this hypothesis in simulated populations. We delineate parameter ranges where this is possible and other ranges where it is not.Our work provides a framework for determining when fitness inference is feasible from population-wide, whole-genome, time-stratified data and highlights settings where it is not. We give a brief survey of biological model organisms and human pathogens that fit into this framework.</description>

      <title>JAMUN: Bridging Smoothed Molecular Dynamics and Score-Based Learning for Conformational Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both for understanding protein function and drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles such as molecular dynamics (MD) are computationally inefficient, while many recent machine learning methods do not transfer to systems outside their training data. We propose JAMUN which performs MD in a smoothed, noised space of all-atom 3D conformations of molecules by utilizing the framework of walk-jump sampling. JAMUN enables ensemble generation for small peptides at rates of an order of magnitude faster than traditional molecular dynamics. The physical priors in JAMUN enables transferability to systems outside of its training data, even to peptides that are longer than those originally trained on. Our model, code and weights are available at https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun.</description>

      <title>Brain pulsations enhance cerebrospinal fluid flow in perivascular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel approach is adopted to model cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in human perivascular spaces (PVSs) surrounding brain-penetrating arteries. It is proposed that the outer PVS boundary oscillates due to brain pulsations and the arterial wall motion is driven by a blood pressure wave. Lubrication theory is employed to derive a mathematical model for the CSF flow, which is then solved numerically. A parametric analysis is undertaken to investigate the effect of the brain pulsations, which shows that pulsations magnify the net axial CSF flows created by the arterial wall motion. The findings suggest that net axial CSF flows are almost entirely positive (deeper into the brain), with arterial wall motion highly dependent on PVS-penetrating artery configurations. Given the glymphatic hypothesis, the findings support the clinical practice of treating dilated PVS as indicators of an increased likelihood of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia.</description>

      <title>Optimization of sequential therapies to maximize extinction of resistant bacteria through collateral sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens global health. A promising and underexplored strategy to tackle this problem are sequential therapies exploiting collateral sensitivity (CS), whereby resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another. Here, we develop a four-genotype stochastic birth-death model with two bacteriostatic antibiotics to identify switching periods that maximize bacterial extinction under subinhibitory concentrations. We show that extinction probability depends nonlinearly on switching period, with stepwise increases aligned to discrete switch events: fast sequential therapies are suboptimal as they do not allow for the evolution of resistance, a key ingredient in these therapies. A geometric distribution framework accurately predicts cumulative extinction probabilities, where the per-switch extinction probability rises with switching period. We further derive a heuristic approximation for the extinction probability based on times to fixation of single-resistant mutants. Sensitivity analyses reveal that strong reciprocal CS is required for this strategy to work, and we explore how increasing antibiotic doses and higher mutation rates modulate extinction in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, we discuss how longer therapies maximize extinction but also cause higher resistance, leading to a Pareto front of optimal switching periods. Our results provide quantitative design principles for in vitro and clinical sequential antibiotic therapies, underscoring the potential of CS-guided regimens to suppress resistance evolution and eradicate infections.</description>
