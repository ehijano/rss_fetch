      <title>Subelliptic Nonlocal Brezis-Nirenberg Problems on Stratified Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the subelliptic nonlocal Brezis-Nirenberg problem on stratified Lie groups involving critical nonlinearities, namely, \begin{align*}
  (-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}, p})^s u&amp;= \mu |u|^{p_s^*-2}u+\lambda h(x, u) \quad \text{in}\quad \Omega, \\ u&amp;=0\quad \text{in}\quad \mathbb{G}\backslash \Omega, \end{align*} where $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{G}, p})^s$ is the fractional $p$-sub-Laplacian on a stratified Lie group $\mathbb{G}$ with homogeneous dimension $Q,$ $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{G},$ $s \in (0,1)$, $\frac{Q}{s}&gt;p\geq2,$ $p_s^*:=\frac{pQ}{Q-ps}$ is subelliptic fractional Sobolev critical exponent, $\mu, \lambda&gt;0$ are real parameters and $h$ is a lower order perturbation of the critical power $|u|^{p_s^*-2}u$. Utilising direct methods of the calculus of variation, we establish the existence of at least one weak solution for the above problem under the condition that the real parameter $\lambda$ is sufficiently small. Additionally, we examine the problem for $\mu = 0$, representing subelliptic nonlocal equations on stratified Lie groups depending on one real positive parameter and involving a subcritical nonlinearity. We demonstrate the existence of at least one solution in this scenario as well. We emphasize that the results obtained here are also novel for $p=2$ even for the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>A hot spots theorem for the mixed eigenvalue problem with small Dirichet region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that on convex domains, first mixed Laplace eigenfunctions have no interior critical points if the Dirichlet region is connected and sufficiently small. We use this result to construct a new family of polygonal domains for which Rauch's hot spots conjecture holds and to prove a new general theorem regarding the hot spots conjecture.</description>

      <title>The Derivative Structure for a Quadratic Nonlinearity and Uniqueness for SQG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional surface quasi-geostrophic equation on a bounded domain with a smooth boundary. Motivated by the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and previous results in the entire space $\mathbb R^2$, we demonstrate that the uniqueness of the mild solution holds in $L^2$. For the proof, we provide a method for handling fractional Laplacians in nonlinear problems, and develop an approach to derive second-order derivativesfor the nonlinear term involving fractional derivatives of the Dirichlet Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Levy driven stochastic heat equation with logarithmic nonlinearity: Well-posedness and Large deviation principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the well-posedness theory for solutions of the stochastic heat equations with logarithmic nonlinearity perturbed by multiplicative Levy noise. By using Aldous tightness criteria and Jakubowski version of the Skorokhod theorem on non-metric spaces along with the standard L2 method, we establish the existence of a path-wise unique strong solution. Moreover, by using a weak convergence method, we establish a large deviation principle for the strong solution of the underlying problem. Due to the lack of linear growth and locally Lipschitzness of the nonlinear term present in the underlying problem, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the nonlinear versions of Gronwall inequalities play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Stability of moving N\'eel walls in ferromagnetic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies moving 180-degree N\'eel walls in ferromagnetic thin films under the reduced model for the in-plane magnetization proposed by Capella, Melcher and Otto [5], in the case when a sufficiently weak external magnetic field is applied. It is shown that the linearization around the moving N\'eel wall's phase determines a spectral problem that is a relatively bounded perturbation of the linearization around the static N\'eel wall, which is the solution when the external magnetic field is set to zero and which is spectrally stable. Uniform resolvent-type estimates for the linearized operator around the static wall are established in order to prove the spectral stability of the moving wall upon application of perturbation theory for linear operators. The spectral analysis is the basis to prove, in turn, both the decaying properties of the generated semigroup and the nonlinear stability of the moving N\'eel wall under small perturbations, in the case of a sufficiently weak external magnetic field. The stability of the static N\'eel wall, which was established in a companion paper [4], plays a key role to obtain the main result.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Ammari et al., SIAM J Math Anal., 52 (2020), pp. 5441--5466], the first author with collaborators proved the existence of Dirac dispersion cones at subwavelength scales in bubbly honeycomb phononic crystals. In this paper, we study the time-evolution of wave packets that are spectrally concentrated near such conical points. We prove that the wave packets dynamics is governed by a time-dependent effective Dirac system, which still depends, but in a simple way, on the subwavelength scale.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of normalized ground states for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish general non-uniqueness results for normalized ground states of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with power nonlinearity on metric graphs. Basically, we show that, whenever in the $L^2$-subcritical regime a graph hosts ground states at every mass, for nonlinearity powers close to the $L^2$-critical exponent $p=6$ there is at least one value of the mass for which ground states are non-unique. As a consequence, we also show that, for all such graphs and nonlinearities, there exist action ground states that are not normalized ground states.</description>

      <title>Global Mild Solutions to a BGK Model for Barotropic Gas Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish global existence of mild solutions to the BGK model proposed by Bouchut [J. Stat. Phys., 95, (1999), 113--170] under the minimal assumption of finite kinetic entropy initial data. Moreover we rigorously derive a kinetic entropy inequality, which combined with the theory developed by Berthelin and Vasseur [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 36, (2005), 1807--1835] leads to the hydrodynamic limit to the barotropic Euler equations. The main tools employed in the analysis are stability estimates for the Maxwellian and a velocity averaging lemma.</description>

      <title>Periodic solutions to nonlocal pseudo-differential equations. A bifurcation theoretical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use abstract bifurcation theory for Fredholm operators of index zero to deal with periodic even solutions of the one-dimensional equation $\mathcal{L}u=\lambda u+|u|^{p}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is a nonlocal pseudodifferential operator defined as a Fourier multiplier and $\lambda$ is the bifurcation parameter. Our general setting includes the fractional Laplacian $\mathcal{L}\equiv(-\Delta)^{s}$ and sharpens the results obtained for this operator to date. As a direct application, we establish the existence of traveling waves for general nonlocal dispersive equations for some velocity ranges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the stability of dark solitons for a general one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. More precisely, we prove the orbital stability of a chain of travelling waves whose speeds are well ordered, taken close to the speed of sound c s and such that the solitons are initially localized far away from each other. The proof relies on the arguments developed by F. B\'ethuel, P. Gravejat and D. Smets and first introduced by Y. Martel, F. Merle and T.-P. Tsai.</description>

      <title>Application of the Weyl calculus perspective on discrete octonionic analysis in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we finish the basic development of the discrete octonionic analysis by presenting a Weyl calculus-based approach to bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^{8}$. In particular, we explicitly prove the discrete Stokes formula for a bounded cuboid, and then we generalise this result to arbitrary bounded domains in interior and exterior settings by the help of characteristic functions. After that, discrete interior and exterior Borel-Pompeiu and Cauchy formulae are introduced. Finally, we recall the construction of discrete octonionic Hardy spaces for bounded domains. Moreover, we explicitly explain where the non-associativity of octonionic multiplication is essential and where it is not. Thus, this paper completes the basic framework of the discrete octonionic analysis introduced in previous papers, and, hence, provides a solid foundation for further studies in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp interior regularity theorem for fully nonlinear maximally subelliptic PDE in non-isotropic Sobolev spaces adapted to maximally subelliptic operators. This result complements the regularity theorem proven by Street for adapted Zygmund-H\"older spaces. This also recovers the classical regularity theorem for fully nonlinear elliptic differential operators for classical Sobolev spaces. We also obtain a sharp interior regularity theorem for fully nonlinear maximally subelliptic PDE in isotropic Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Linearized dynamic stability for vortices of Ginzburg-Landau evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of dynamical stability for the $n$-vortex of the Ginzburg-Landau model. Vortices are one of the main examples of topological solitons, and their dynamic stability is the basic assumption of the asymptotic ``particle plus field'' description of interacting vortices. In this paper we focus on co-rotational perturbations of vortices and establish decay estimates for their linearized evolution in the relativistic case.
  One of the main ingredients is a construction of the distorted Fourier basis associated to the linearized operator at the vortex. The general approach follows that of Krieger-Schlag-Tataru and Krieger-Miao-Schlag and relies on the spectral analysis of Schr\"odinger operators with strongly singular potentials. Since one of the operators appearing in the linearization has zero energy solutions that oscillate at infinity, additional work is needed for our construction and to control the spectral measure. The decay estimates that we obtain are of both wave and Klein-Gordon type, and are consistent with the general theory for $2$d Schr\"odinger operators, including those that have an $s$-wave resonance, as in the present case, but faster decaying potentials.
  Finally, we give a new proof of the absence of unstable spectrum and provide an estimate on the location of embedded eigenvalues by using a suitable Lieb-Thirring inequality due to Ekholm and Frank. In particular, we show that eigenvalues must lie in the interval $(1.332,2)$, where $2$ represents the effective mass of one of the two scalar operators appearing in the linearization.</description>

      <title>Sequential bi-level regularized inversion with application to hidden reaction law discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop and present a novel regularization scheme for ill-posed inverse problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In [43], the author suggested a bi-level regularization framework. This study significantly improves upon the bi-level algorithm by sequential initialization, yielding accelerated convergence and demonstrable multi-scale effect, while retaining regularizing effect with respect to noise and allows for the usage of inexact PDE solvers. The sequential bi-level approach illustrates its universality through several reaction-diffusion applications, in which the nonlinear reaction law needs to be determined. To demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms, we moreover prove that the proposed tangential cone condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Principal frequency of clamped plates on RCD(0,N) spaces: sharpness, rigidity and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fine properties of the principal frequency of clamped plates in the (possibly singular) setting of metric measure spaces verifying the RCD(0,N) condition, i.e., infinitesimally Hilbertian spaces with non-negative Ricci curvature and dimension bounded above by N&gt;1 in the synthetic sense. The initial conjecture -- an isoperimetric inequality for the principal frequency of clamped plates -- has been formulated in 1877 by Lord Rayleigh in the Euclidean case and solved affirmatively in dimensions 2 and 3 by Ashbaugh and Benguria [Duke Math. J., 1995] and Nadirashvili [Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal., 1995]. The main contribution of the present work is a new isoperimetric inequality for the principal frequency of clamped plates in RCD(0,N) spaces whenever N is close enough to 2 or 3. The inequality contains the so-called ``asymptotic volume ratio", and turns out to be sharp under the subharmonicity of the distance function, a condition satisfied in metric measure cones. In addition, rigidity (i.e., equality in the isoperimetric inequality) and stability results are established in terms of the cone structure of the RCD(0,N) space as well as the shape of the eigenfunction for the principal frequency, given by means of Bessel functions. These results are new even for Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. We discuss examples of both smooth and non-smooth spaces where the results can be applied.</description>

      <title>Effect of energy dissipation on radiofrequency ablation model in cardiac tissue: modelling, analysis and numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of a new nonlinear ablation system modeling radiofrequency ablation phenomena in cardiac tissue, {which incorporates the effects of blood flow on the heat generated when ablation by radiofrequency. The model also considers the effects of viscous energy dissipation. It consists of a coupled thermistor problem and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations that describe the evolution of temperature, velocity and potential in cardiac tissue.} In addition to Faedo--Galerkin method, we use Schauder's fixed-point theory to prove the existence of the weak solutions in two- and three-dimensional space. Moreover, we prove the uniqueness of the solution under some additional conditions on the data and the solution. Finally, we discuss some numerical results for the validation of the proposed model using the finite element method.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness for the heat equation with density on infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the uniqueness of solutions to a class of heat equations with positive density posed on infinite weighted graphs. We separately consider the case when the density is bounded from below by a positive constant and the case of possibly vanishing density, showing that these two scenarios lead to two different classes of uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Li-Yau inequalities for the Helfrich functional and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12360v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general Li-Yau inequality for the Helfrich functional where the spontaneous curvature enters with a singular volume type integral. In the physically relevant cases, this term can be converted into an explicit energy threshold that guarantees embeddedness. We then apply our result to the spherical case of the variational Canham-Helfrich model. If the infimum energy is not too large, we show existence of smoothly embedded minimizers. Previously, existence of minimizers was only known in the classes of immersed bubble trees or curvature varifolds.</description>

      <title>Assembling algorithm for Green's tensors and absorbing boundary conditions for Galbrun's equation in radial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar oscillations can be modeled by Galbrun's equation which describes Lagrangian wave displacement in a self-gravitating stratified medium. For spherically symmetric backgrounds, we construct an algorithm to compute efficiently and accurately the coefficients of the Green's tensor of the time-harmonic equation in vector spherical harmonic basis. With only two resolutions, our algorithm provides values of the kernels for all heights of source and receiver, and prescribes analytically the singularities of the kernels. We also derive absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) to model wave propagation in the atmosphere above the cut-off frequency. The construction of ABC, which contains varying gravity terms, is rendered difficult by the complex behavior of the solar potential in low atmosphere and for frequencies below the Lamb frequency. We carry out extensive numerical investigations to compare and evaluate the efficiency of the ABCs in capturing outgoing solutions. Finally, as an application towards helioseismology, we compute synthetic solar power spectra that contain pressure modes as well as internal-gravity (g-) and surface-gravity (f-) ridges which are missing in simpler approximations of the wave equation. For purpose of validation, the location of the ridges in the synthetic power spectra are compared with observed solar modes.</description>

      <title>The point scatterer approximation for wave dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an open, bounded and connected set $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and its rescaling $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$ of size $\varepsilon\ll 1$, we consider the solutions of the Cauchy problem for the inhomogeneous wave equation $$ (\varepsilon^{-2}\chi_{\Omega_{\varepsilon}}+\chi_{\mathbb{R}^{3}\backslash\Omega_{\varepsilon}})\partial_{tt}u=\Delta u+f $$ with initial data and source supported outside $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$; here, $\chi_{S}$ denotes the characteristic function of a set $S$. We provide the first-order $\varepsilon$-corrections with respect to the solutions of the inhomogeneous free wave equation and give space-time estimates on the remainders in the $L^{\infty}((0,1/\varepsilon^{\tau}),L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{3})) $-norm. Such corrections are explicitly expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Newton potential operator in $L^{2}(\Omega)$ and provide an effective dynamics describing a legitimate point scatterer approximation in the time domain.</description>
