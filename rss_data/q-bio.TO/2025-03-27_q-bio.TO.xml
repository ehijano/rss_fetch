      <title>The Role of Computational Modeling in Enhancing Thermal Safety During Cardiac Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: In this review, we aim to provide an analysis of current cardiac ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RF), cryoablation, and pulsed-field ablation (PFA), with a focus on the role of computational modeling in enhancing the precision, safety, and effectiveness of these treatments. Particular attention is given to thermal management, exploring how computational approaches contribute to understanding and controlling energy delivery, heat distribution, and tissue response during ablation procedures. Methods: The mechanisms, applications, and limitations of radiofrequency (RF) ablation, cryoablation, and pulsed field ablation (PFA) are reviewed. Additionally, the use of computational approaches, including numerical methods and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models, for evaluating energy distribution, lesion size, and tissue response during ablation procedures is discussed. Results: Computational methods can predict ablation treatment outcomes and help optimize lesion size, ablation parameters, and procedural safety. However, these models are only reliable when properly validated and verified. Conclusion: Further research is essential to collect reliable in vivo data for validating computational models and integrating them into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.</description>
