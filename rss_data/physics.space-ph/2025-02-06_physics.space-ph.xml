      <title>Small-scale inhomogeneity effects on coherent solar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02832v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent radio emission mechanism of solar radio bursts is one of the most complicated and controversial topics in solar physics. To clarify the mechanism(s) of different types of solar radio bursts, (radio) wave excitation by energetic electrons in homogeneous plasmas has been widely studied via particle-in-cell (PIC) code numerical simulations. The solar corona is, however, inhomogeneous over almost all spatial scales. Inhomogeneities of the plasma could influence the emission properties of solar radio bursts. In this paper, we, hence, investigate effects of inhomogeneity (in the magnetic field, plasma density and temperature) of plasmas in the solar corona on radio wave emission by ring-beam distributed energetic electrons utilizing 2.5-dimensional PIC simulations. Both the beam and electron cyclotron maser (ECM) instabilities could be triggered with the presence of the energetic ring-beam electrons. The resultant spectrum of the excited electromagnetic waves presents a zebra-stripe pattern in the frequency space. The inhomogeneous density or temperature in plasmas influences the frequency bandwidth and location of these excited waves. Our results can, hence, help to diagnose the plasma properties at the emission sites of solar radio bursts. Applications of our results to the solar radio bursts with zebra-stripe pattern are discussed.</description>

      <title>Development of Radar and Optical Tracking of Near-Earth Asteroids at the University of Tasmania</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail the use of the University of Tasmania's (UTAS) optical and radio telescopes to conduct observations of near-Earth asteroids from 2021 to 2024. The Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex transmitted a radio signal at 7159.45 MHz, with the radar echo detected by the UTAS radio telescopes. The method of accounting for the Doppler shift between the stations and the near-Earth object is described so that others can implement a similar program. We present our results, with confirmed detections of 1994 PC1 and 2003 UC20 asteroids using the Hobart and Katherine 12-m antennas, demonstrating the feasibility of using small radio telescopes for these observations. Additionally, the recently upgraded Ceduna 30 m antenna was used to detect 2024 MK. Data collected from other observatories, such as Tidbinbilla, as well as the UTAS radar tracking of the moon are also presented in the context of demonstrating the means of applying these Doppler corrections and the accuracy of each method. Optical observations conducted in this period are also detailed as they complement radar observations and aid in refining the orbit parameters.</description>

      <title>Coronal hole picoflare jets are progenitors of both fast and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfv\'enic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere. The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of this wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations reveal intermittent jets, with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to solar wind have not been established. Here, we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft that establish a unified picture of fast and Alfv\'{e}nic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field Amplification in a Rotating Astrophysical Plasma Sphere: $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the generation of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects in a rotating spherical plasma system with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity in the northern and southern hemispheres and examined their contributions to the induction of magnetic fields. We found that the $\alpha$ effect is relatively small, and its sign depends on the polarization of kinetic helicity. In contrast, the $\beta$ effect remains negative regardless of the sign of kinetic helicity. Despite its small magnitude, the $\alpha$ effect plays a crucial role in determining the polarity of helical magnetic structures, while a negative $\beta$ indicates energy diffusion from turbulent regions into the large-scale magnetic field. We derived the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity using different approaches, incorporating large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data. These were used to reproduce the large-scale magnetic field and compare it with DNS results. In the kinematic regime, where the magnetic field strength is weak, our results align well; however, in regions with strong nonlinear magnetic effects, the magnetic field reproduced using turbulent kinetic data diverges. This divergence is attributed to insufficient quenching of the $\beta$ effect, suggesting that including the second-moment terms of velocity in the magnetic field effect would improve the accuracy of the $\beta$ coefficient. In this study, we considered the case of a rotating plasma sphere with $Pr_M = 1$ and low Reynolds numbers. However, in reality, Reynolds numbers are much higher, and $Pr_M$ is much less than 1, which necessitates further studies on this topic. We plan to address this in future research.</description>
