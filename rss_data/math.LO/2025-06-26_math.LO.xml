      <title>La logique continue des corps globalement valu\'es</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous logic of globally valued fields -- A globally valued field is a field endowed with a family of absolute values that satisfy a product formula. Number fields and function fields in one variable give classical and fundamental examples; Nevanlinna theory also gives rise to such structures on the field of meromorphic functions on $\mathbf C$. These globally valued fields can be studied in the context of continuous logic (for which the predicates are real valued), and such a study has been undertaken some 10 years ago by Ben Yaacov and Hrushovski, thus providing a model-theoretic framework for the diophantine theory of heights. One of the first fundamental results in the tehory states the the field of algebraic numbers, with its essentially unique structure of a globally valued field, is existentially closed: every system involving polynomial equalities and inequalities, as well as strict inequalities in heights, possesses a solution in algebraic numbers as soon as it possesses some solution in a globally valued extension. The proof, due to Szachniewicz, is inspired by the proof proposed by Ben Yaacov and Hrushovski in the case of function fields: the latter used in a crucial way the description by Boucksom, Demailly, P\u aun and Peternell of the cone of mobile curves in a complex projective variety, the case of number fields relies on recent results in Arakelov geometry.</description>

      <title>Iterated jump noncomputability and compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use reverse mathematics to analyze "iterated jump" versions of the following four principles: the atomic model theorem with subenumerable types (AST), the diagonally noncomputable principle (DNR), weak weak K\H{o}nig's lemma (WWKL), and weak K\H{o}nig's lemma (WKL). The logical relationships between these principles are summarized in Figure 1 and include, among other things, an infinite chain and an infinite antichain, the latter of which represents a strong form of non-linearity in terms of provability strength among "natural" combinatorial principles.</description>

      <title>On $NP \cap coNP$ proof complexity generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of proof complexity generators we consider the following $\Sigma^p_2$ search problem $\mbox{DD}_P$ determined by a propositional proof system $P$: given a $P$-proof $\pi$ of a disjunction $\bigvee_i \alpha_i$, no two $\alpha_i$ having an atom in common, find $i$ such that $\alpha_i \in \mbox{TAUT}$.
  We formulate a hypothesis (ST) that for some strong proof system $P$ the problem $\mbox{DD}_P$ is not solvable in the student-teacher model with a p-time student and a constant number of rounds. The hypothesis follows from the existence of hard one-way permutations.
  We prove, using a model-theoretic assumption, that (ST) implies $NP \neq coNP$. The assumption concerns the existence of extensions of models of a bounded arithmetic theory and it is open at present if it holds.</description>

      <title>Cofibrant generation of pure monomorphisms in presheaf categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise when the pure monomorphisms in a presheaf category $\mathbf{Set}^\mathcal{C}$ are cofibrantly generated in terms of the category $\mathcal{C}$. In particular, when $\mathcal{C}$ is a monoid $S$ this characterises cofibrant generation of pure monomorphisms between sets with an $S$-action in terms of $S$: this happens if and only if for all $a, b \in S$ there is $c \in S$ such that $a = cb$ or $ca = b$. We give a model-theoretic proof: we prove that our characterisation is equivalent to having a stable independence relation, which in turn is equivalent to cofibrant generation. As a corollary, we show that pure monomorphisms in acts over the multiplicative monoid of natural numbers are not cofibrantly generated.</description>

      <title>Intuitionistic NF Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.00506v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop NF set theory using intuitionistic logic; we call this theory INF. We develop the theories of finite sets and their power sets, finite cardinals and their ordering, cardinal exponentiation, addition, and multiplication. We follow Rosser and Specker with appropriate constructive modifications, especially replacing "arbitrary subset" by "separable subset" in the definitions of exponentiation and order. It is not known whether \INF\ proves that the set of finite cardinals is infinite, so the whole development must allow for the possibility that there is a maximum integer; arithmetical computations might "overflow" as in a computer or odometer, and theorems about them must be carefully stated to allow for this possibility. The work presented here is intended as a substrate for further investigations of INF.</description>

      <title>Corona Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11618v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a unified overview of the study of the effects of additional set theoretic axioms on quotient structures. Our focus is on rigidity, measured in terms of existence (or rather non-existence) of suitably non-trivial automorphisms of the quotients in question. A textbook example for the study of this topic is the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})/\text{Fin}$, whose behavior is the template around which this survey revolves: Forcing axioms imply that all of its automorphisms are trivial, in the sense that they are induced by almost permutations of $\mathbb{N}$, while under the Continuum Hypothesis this rigidity fails and $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})/\text{Fin}$ admits uncountably many non-trivial automorphisms. We consider far-reaching generalisations of this phenomenon and present a wide variety of situations where analogous patterns persist, focusing mainly (but not exclusively) on the categories of Boolean algebras, \v{C}ech-Stone remainders, and $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras. We survey the state of the art and the future prospects of this field, discussing the major open problems and outlining the main ideas of the proofs whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Extendible cardinals, and Laver-generic large cardinal axioms for extendibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce (super-$C^{(\infty)}$-)Laver-generic large cardinal axioms for extendibility ((super-$C^{(\infty)}$-)LgLCAs for extendible, for short), and show that most of the previously known consequences of the (super-$C^{(\infty)}$-)LgLCAs for ultrahuge, in particular, general forms of Resurrection Principles, Maximality Principles, and Absoluteness Theorems, already follow from (super-$C^{(\infty)}$\mbox{-)}LgLCAs for extendible.
  The consistency of LgLCAs for extendible (for transfinitely iterable $\Sigma_2$-definable classes of posets) follows from an extendible cardinal while the consistency of super-$C^{(\infty)}$-LgLCAs for extendible follows from a model with a strongly super-$C^{(\infty)}$-extendible cardinal. If $\mu$ is an almost-huge cardinal, there are cofinally many $\kappa&lt;\mu$ such that\ $V_\mu\models$``$\kappa$ is strongly super-$C^{(\infty)}$ extendible''.
  Most of the known reflection properties follow already from some of the LgLCAs for supercompact. We give a survey on the related results.
  We also show the separation between some of the LgLCAs as well as between LgLCAs and their consequences.
  LgLCAs are generic large cardinal axioms in terms of generic elementary embeddings with the critical point $\kappa_{\mathfrak{refl}}=\max\{\aleph_2,2^{\aleph_0}\}$. We show that Laver generic large cardinal axioms for all posets\ in terms of generic elementary embeddings with the critical point $2^{\aleph_0}$ is also possible. We abbreviate this type of axiom for the notion of extendibility as the LgLCAA for extendible and examine its consequences.</description>

      <title>Matching logic -- a new axiomatization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these notes we propose a new, simpler proof system for first-order matching logic with application and definedness. The new proof system is inspired by Tarski's axiomatization for first order-logic with equality (simplified by Kalish and Montague), that does not involve the notions of a free variable and free substitution. We give also a proof system for first-order matching logic with application, obtained by adapting to matching logic G\"{o}del's proof system for first-order intuitionistic logic.</description>
