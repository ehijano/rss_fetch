      <title>Settling of two rigidly connected spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments and particle-resolved simulations are employed to investigate the settling dynamics of a pair of rigidly connected spherical particles of unequal size. They yield a detailed picture of the transient evolution and the terminal values of the aggregate's orientation angle and its settling and drift velocities as functions of the aspect ratio and the Galileo number $Ga$, which denotes the ratio of buoyancy and viscous forces acting on the aggregate. At low to moderate values of $Ga$, the aggregate's orientation and velocity converge to their terminal values monotonically, whereas for higher $Ga$-values the aggregate tends to undergo a more complex motion. If the aggregate assumes an asymmetric terminal orientation, it displays a nonzero terminal drift velocity. For diameter ratios much larger than one and small $Ga$, the terminal orientation of the aggregate becomes approximately vertical, whereas when $Ga$ is sufficiently large for flow separation to occur, the aggregate orients itself such that the smaller sphere is located at the separation line. Empirical scaling laws are obtained for the terminal settling velocity and orientation angle as functions of the aspect ratio and $Ga$ for diameter ratios from 1 to 4 and particle-to-fluid density ratios from 1.3 to 5. An analysis of the accompanying flow field shows the formation of vortical structures exhibiting complex topologies in the aggregate's wake, and it indicates the formation of a horizontal pressure gradient across the larger sphere, which represents the main reason for the emergence of the drift velocity.</description>

      <title>Spanwise wall forcing can reduce turbulent heat transfer more than drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations are performed of turbulent forced convection in a channel flow with spanwise wall oscillation, either as a plane oscillation or as a streamwise travelling wave. The friction Reynolds number is fixed at $Re_{\tau_0} = 590$, but the Prandtl number $Pr$ is varied from 0.71 to 20. For $Pr&gt;1$, the heat transfer is reduced by more than the drag, 40% compared to 30% at $Pr=7.5$. This Reynolds analogy breaking is related to the different responses of the velocity and thermal fields to the Stokes layer. It is shown that the Stokes layer near the wall attenuates the large-scale energy of the turbulent heat-flux and the turbulent shear-stress, but amplifies their small-scale energy. At higher Prandtl numbers, the thinning of the conductive sublayer means that the energetic scales of the turbulent heat-flux move closer to the wall, where they are exposed to a stronger Stokes layer production, increasing the contribution of the small-scale energy amplification. A predictive model is derived for the Reynolds and Prandtl number dependence of the heat-transfer reduction based on the scaling of the thermal statistics. The model agrees well with the computations for Prandtl numbers up to 20.</description>

      <title>Internally heated convection with rotation: bounds and scaling laws for heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates heat transport in rotating internally heated convection, for a horizontally periodic fluid between parallel plates under no-slip and isothermal boundary conditions. The main results are the proof of bounds on the mean temperature, $\overline{\langle T \rangle }$, and the heat flux out of the bottom boundary, $\mathcal{F}_B$ at infinite Prandtl numbers where the Prandtl number is the nondimensional ratio of viscous to thermal diffusion. The lower bounds are functions of a Rayleigh number quantifying the ratio of internal heating to diffusion and the Ekman number, $E$, which quantifies the ratio of viscous diffusion to rotation. We utilise two different estimates on the vertical velocity, $w$, one pointwise in the domain (Yan 2004, J. Math. Phys., vol. 45(7), pp. 2718-2743) and the other an integral estimate over the domain (Constantin et al . 1999, Phys. D: Non. Phen., vol. 125, pp. 275-284), resulting in bounds valid for different regions of buoyancy-to-rotation dominated convection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that similar to rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, for small $E$, the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection asymptotically scales as $E^{-4/3}$.This result is combined with heuristic arguments for internally heated and rotating convection to arrive at scaling laws for $\overline{\langle T \rangle }$ and $\mathcal{F}_B$ valid for arbitrary Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>Charged drop impinging on particles dispersed over a metallic plate: A method of particle cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electric field applied to a droplet impinging on a hydrophobic surface has an extensive variety of applications, including ant-icing, heat transfer enhancement, self-cleaning, droplet manipulation, and electrostatic spraying. The present study demonstrates an effective method of particle removal using a charged droplet. This method employs a pin-plate electrode setup to investigate the dynamics of a charged droplet impact on the surface covered with particles. The particles of different properties such as wettability, electrical conductivity, etc. have been used. Silane-coated glass beads, carbon black, and glass beads are dispersed over the ground copper electrode. The applied potential is also varied from 2 kV to 4 kV. A high-speed imaging is employed to visualize the drop motion, dynamic behavior, and self-cleaning phenomenon. The experimental results indicate that drop generation and impact occur at applied potentials of 2.5, 3, and 3.5 kV, in contrast, at 2 kV, there is no droplet pinch-off. At 4 kV, electric breakdown and bridging of the droplet between the capillary and ground electrode are observed. The drop impact on the silane-coated glass bead leads to their attachment due to the adhesiveness of the particles and the droplet. The silane-coated particles are removed from the droplet surface due to the deformation of the drop and the electric repulsive force. In the case of carbon black and glass beads, the particles are captured by the droplet due to the electrostatic force of attraction. Higher electric potentials lead to an increased spreading diameter of the droplet. The higher electric field enhances the contact area between the droplet and the particles, thereby removing more particles.</description>

      <title>A cascade model for the discontinuous absorbing phase transition between turbulent and laminar flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model of energy transfer through scales to describe, at a qualitative level, the subcritical transition between laminar and turbulent flows, viewed in a statistical physics framework as a discontinuous absorbing phase transition. The main control parameter of the model is a Reynolds number that compares energy transfer to viscous dissipation on a large length scale. In spite of its simplicity, the model qualitatively reproduces a number of salient features of the subcritical laminar-turbulent transition, including the existence of an absorbing laminar state, the discontinuous onset of a metastable fluctuating turbulent state above a threshold Reynolds number, and a faster-than-exponential increase of the turbulence lifetime when increasing the Reynolds number. The behavior of the model is also consistent, at high Reynolds number, with the Kolmogorov K41 phenomenology of fully developed turbulence.</description>

      <title>Shape uncertainty analysis of laminar forced convection in a round microchannel with viscous dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of a microchannel is usually affected by a significant uncertainty due to the small size of the cross-section, comparable with the typical wall-roughness length scale. Such an uncertainty is present at any scale, but it is definitely amplified and, hence, significantly important when the hydraulic diameter becomes smaller than some tenth micrometers. The focus of this paper is on the numerical analysis of the sensitivity to shape random modification, within a prefixed maximum extent, of the main flow and heat transfer characteristics of fully-developed forced convection. The numerical solutions are carried out by employing a finite-element solver repeated over a statistical sample of randomly generated perimetral profiles that simulate the wall roughness. The study includes the evaluation of the Fanning friction factor and of the Nusselt number for the T, H1 and H2 thermal boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Unfolding Time: Generative Modeling for Turbulent Flows in 4D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study in turbulent flow simulation demonstrated the potential of generative diffusion models for fast 3D surrogate modeling. This approach eliminates the need for specifying initial states or performing lengthy simulations, significantly accelerating the process. While adept at sampling individual frames from the learned manifold of turbulent flow states, the previous model lacks the capability to generate sequences, hindering analysis of dynamic phenomena. This work addresses this limitation by introducing a 4D generative diffusion model and a physics-informed guidance technique that enables the generation of realistic sequences of flow states. Our findings indicate that the proposed method can successfully sample entire subsequences from the turbulent manifold, even though generalizing from individual frames to sequences remains a challenging task. This advancement opens doors for the application of generative modeling in analyzing the temporal evolution of turbulent flows, providing valuable insights into their complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Freely Decaying Saffman Turbulence Experimentally Generated by Magnetic Stirrers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally the decay of three-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence, initially generated by the erratic motions of centimeter-size magnetic stirrers in a closed container. Such zero-mean-flow homogeneous isotropic turbulence is well suited to test Saffman's model and Batchelor's model of freely decaying turbulence. Here, we report a consistent set of experimental measurements (temporal decay of the turbulent kinetic energy, of the energy dissipation rate, and growth of the integral scale) strongly supporting the Saffman model. We also measure the conservation of the Saffman invariant at early times of the decay and show that the energy spectrum scales as $k^{2}$ at large scales and keeps its self-similar shape during the decay. This letter thus presents the first experimental evidence of the validity of the connection between the Saffman invariant and the $k^{2}$-energy spectrum of the large scales. The final decay regime closely corresponds to Saffman's model when the container size is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Anomalous mass diffusion in a binary mixture and Rayleigh-Benard instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The onset of the Rayleigh-Benard instability in a horizontal fluid layer is investigated by assuming the fluid as a binary mixture and the concentration buoyancy as the driving force. The focus of this study is on the anomalous diffusion phenomenology emerging when the mean squared displacement of molecules in the diffusive random walk is not proportional to time, as in the usual Fick's diffusion, but it is proportional to a power of time. The power-law model of anomalous diffusion identifies subdiffusion when the power-law index is smaller than unity, while it describes superdiffusion when the power-law index is larger than unity. This study reconsiders the stability analysis of the Rayleigh-Benard problem by extending the governing equations to include the anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Realizability-Informed Machine Learning for Turbulence Anisotropy Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others.</description>

      <title>Wake dynamics of wind turbines in unsteady streamwise flow conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unsteady flow physics of wind-turbine wakes under dynamic forcing conditions are critical to the modeling and control of wind farms for optimal power density. Unsteady forcing in the streamwise direction may be generated by unsteady inflow conditions in the atmospheric boundary layer, dynamic induction control of the turbine, or streamwise surge motions of a floating offshore wind turbine due to floating-platform oscillations. This study seeks to identify the dominant flow mechanisms in unsteady wakes forced by a periodic upstream inflow condition. A theoretical framework for the problem is derived, which describes traveling-wave undulations in the wake radius and streamwise velocity. These dynamics encourage the aggregation of tip vortices into large structures that are advected along in the wake. Flow measurements in the wake of a periodically surging turbine were obtained in an optically accessible towing-tank facility, with an average diameter-based Reynolds number of 300,000 and with surge-velocity amplitudes of up to 40% of the mean inflow velocity. Qualitative agreement between trends in the measurements and model predictions is observed, supporting the validity of the theoretical analyses. The experiments also demonstrate large enhancements in the recovery of the wake relative to the steady-flow case, with wake-length reductions of up to 46.5% and improvements in the available power at 10 diameters downstream of up to 15.7%. These results provide fundamental insights into the dynamics of unsteady wakes and serve as additional evidence that unsteady fluid mechanics can be leveraged to increase the power density of wind farms.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Critic in an Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Swimming in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain a particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts with the intended goal by developing and comparing a novel Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL) strategy with prescribed control (PC) and standard physics-agnostic Reinforcement Learning strategies. Our PIRL scheme, coined the Actor-Physicist, is an adaptation of the Actor-Critic algorithm in which the Neural Network parameterized Critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function (the physicist). This strategy is then compared with an analytically computed optimal PC policy derived from a stochastic optimal control formulation and standard physics-agnostic Actor-Critic type algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Finite Difference Informed Graph Network for Solving Steady-State Incompressible Flows on Block-Structured Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, advancements in deep learning have enabled physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical differentiation (ND) using the finite difference (FD) method is efficient in physics-constrained designs, even in parameterized settings, often employing body-fitted block-structured grids for complex flow cases. However, convolution operators in CNNs for finite differences are typically limited to single-block grids. To address this, we use graphs and graph networks (GNs) to learn flow representations across multi-block structured grids. We propose a graph convolution-based finite difference method (GC-FDM) to train GNs in a physics-constrained manner, enabling differentiable finite difference operations on graph unstructured outputs. Our goal is to solve parametric steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows around a backward-facing step, a circular cylinder, and double cylinders, using multi-block structured grids. Comparing our method to a CFD solver under various boundary conditions, we demonstrate improved training efficiency and accuracy, achieving a minimum relative error of $10^{-3}$ in velocity field prediction and a 20\% reduction in training cost compared to PINNs.</description>

      <title>Influence of the flow split ratio on the position of the main atrial vortex: implications for stasis on the left atrial appendage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Despite recent advances made in recent years with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques applied to blood flow within the left atrium (LA), the relationship between atrial geometry, flow patterns, and blood stasis within the left atrial appendage (LAA) is still elusive. A better understanding of this relationship would have important clinical implications, as these thrombi originating in the LAA are a common cause of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
  Aim: The main objective of this study was to identify representative atrial flow patterns depending on the atrial geometry, how they are affected by varying the flow split ratio and some common atrial modeling assumptions, and their incidence on LAA blood stasis.
  Methods: To this end, three recent techniques were applied to 9 patient-specific CFD models of patients with AF: a kinematic atrial model to isolate the influence of wall motion due to AF, a projection on a universal LAA coordinate system, and quantification of stagnant volume.
  Results: Three representative atrial flow patterns were identified, depending on the relative position of the main atrial vortex. The work also illustrated how atrial flow patterns are highly affected by variations in the flow split ratio, inducing the formation of a larger stagnant volume. Since the flow-split ratio is determined by the patient's body-side position, we suggest that the most frequent lying position adopted while sleeping may have implications for the risk of stroke in the medium and long term for a certain patient.</description>

      <title>Modeling unsteady loads on wind-turbine blade sections from periodic structural oscillations and impinging gusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14517v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many traditional methods for wind turbine design and analysis assume quasi-steady aerodynamics, but atmospheric flows are inherently unsteady and modern turbine blades are susceptible to aeroelastic deformations. This study therefore evaluates the effectiveness of simple analytical models for capturing the effects of such unsteady conditions on wind-turbine blades. We consider a pitching and plunging airfoil in a periodic transverse gust as an idealization of unsteady loading scenarios on a blade section. A potential-flow model derived from a linear combination of canonical problems is proposed to predict the unsteady lift on a two-dimensional airfoil in the small-perturbation limit. We then perform high-fidelity two-dimensional numerical simulations of a NACA-0012 airfoil over a range of periodic pitch, plunge, and gust disturbances, and quantify the amplitude and phase of the unsteady lift response. Good agreement with the model predictions is found for low to moderate forcing amplitudes and frequencies, while deviations are observed when the angle-of-attack amplitudes approach the static flow-separation limit of the airfoil. Potential explanations are given for the cases in which the ideal-flow theory proves insufficient. This theoretical framework and numerical evaluation motivate the inclusion of unsteady flow models in design and simulation tools in order to increase the robustness and operational lifespans of wind turbine blades in real flow conditions.</description>

      <title>The coherent structure of the energy cascade in isotropic turbulence</title>

Abstract: The energy cascade, i.e. the transfer of kinetic energy from large-scale to small-scale flow motions, has been the cornerstone of turbulence theories and models since the 1940s. However, understanding the spatial organization of the energy transfer has remained elusive. In this study, we utilize numerical data of isotropic turbulence to investigate the three-dimensional spatial structure of the energy cascade. Specifically, we focus on analyzing the averaged flow patterns associated with intense energy transfer events in the inertial range. Our findings indicate that forward energy-transfer events are predominantly confined in the high strain-rate region created between two distinct zones of elevated enstrophy. On average, these zones manifest in the form of two hairpin-like shapes with opposing orientations. The mean velocity field associated with the energy transfer exhibits a saddle point topology when observed in the frame of reference local to the event. The analysis also shows that the primary driving mechanism for the cascade involves strain-rate self-amplification, which is responsible for 85% of the energy transfer, whereas vortex stretching accounts for less than 15%.</description>

      <title>turbo-RANS: Straightforward and Efficient Bayesian Optimization of Turbulence Model Coefficients</title>

Abstract: Industrial simulations of turbulent flows often rely on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, which contain numerous closure coefficients that need to be calibrated. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a semi-automated calibration of these coefficients using a new framework (referred to as turbo-RANS) based on Bayesian optimization. We introduce the generalized error and default coefficient preference (GEDCP) objective function, which can be used with integral, sparse, or dense reference data for the purpose of calibrating RANS turbulence closure model coefficients. Then, we describe a Bayesian optimization-based algorithm for conducting the calibration of these model coefficients. An in-depth hyperparameter tuning study is conducted to recommend efficient settings for the turbo-RANS optimization procedure. We demonstrate that the performance of the $k$-$\omega$ shear stress transport (SST) and Generalized $k$-$\omega$ (GEKO) turbulence models can be efficiently improved via turbo-RANS, for three example cases: predicting the lift coefficient of an airfoil; predicting the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy fields for a separated flow; and, predicting the wall pressure coefficient distribution for flow through a converging-diverging channel. This work is the first to propose and provide an open-source black-box calibration procedure for turbulence model coefficients based on Bayesian optimization. We propose a data-flexible objective function for the calibration target. Our open-source implementation of the turbo-RANS framework includes OpenFOAM, Ansys Fluent, STAR-CCM+, and solver-agnostic templates for user application.</description>

      <title>Effect of rotation on wake vortices in stratified flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stratified wakes past an isolated conical seamount are simulated at a Froude number of $Fr = 0.15$ and Rossby numbers of $Ro = 0.15$, 0.75, and $\infty$. The wakes exhibit a K{\' a}rm{\' a}n vortex street, unlike their unstratified, non-rotating counterpart. Vortex structures are studied in terms of large-scale global modes, as well as spatially localised vortex evolution, with a focus on rotation effects. The global modes are extracted by spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). For all three studied $Ro$ ranging from mesoscale, submesoscale, and non-rotating cases, the frequency of the SPOD modes at different heights remains coupled as a global constant. However, the shape of the SPOD modes changes from slanted `tongues' at zero rotation ($Ro=\infty$) to tall hill-height columns at strong rotation ($Ro=0.15$). A novel method for vortex centre tracking shows that, in all three cases, the vortices at different heights advect uniformly at about $ 0.9U_{\infty}$ beyond the near wake, consistent with the lack of variability of the global modes. Under system rotation, cyclonic vortices (CVs) and anticyclonic vortices (AVs) present considerable asymmetry, especially at $Ro = 0.75$. The vorticity distribution as well as the stability of AVs are tracked downstream using statistics conditioned to the identified vortex centres. At $Ro=0.75$, intense AVs with relative vorticity up to $\omega_z/f_{\rm c}=-2.4$ are seen with small regions of instability but all AVs evolve towards a more stable state. Recent stability analysis that accounts for stratification and viscosity is found to improve on earlier criteria.</description>

      <title>Building-block flow model for computational fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a closure model for wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES), referred to as the Building-block Flow Model (BFM). The foundation of the model rests on the premise that a finite collection of simple flows encapsulates the essential physics necessary to predict more complex scenarios. The BFM is implemented using artificial neural networks and introduces five advancements within the framework of WMLES: (1) It is designed to predict multiple flow regimes (wall turbulence under zero, favorable, adverse mean-pressure-gradient, and separation); (2) It unifies the closure model at solid boundaries (i.e., the wall model) and the rest of the flow (i.e., the subgrid-scale model) into a single entity; (3) It ensures consistency with numerical schemes and gridding strategy by accounting for numerical errors; (4) It is directly applicable to arbitrary complex geometries; (5) It can be scaled up to model additional flow physics in the future if needed (e.g., shockwaves and laminar-to-turbulent transition). The BFM is utilized to predict key quantities of interest in turbulent channel and pipe flows, a Gaussian bump, a simplified aircraft, and a realistic aircraft in landing configuration. In all cases, the BFM demonstrates similar or superior capabilities in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art closure models.</description>

      <title>Percolation without trapping: how Ostwald ripening during two-phase displacement in porous media alters capillary pressure and relative permeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional measurements of two-phase flow in porous media often use completely immiscible fluids, or are performed over time-scales of days to weeks. If applied to the study of gas storage and recovery, these measurements do not properly account for Ostwald ripening, significantly over-estimating the amount of trapping and hysteresis. When there is transport of dissolved species in the aqueous phase, local capillary equilibrium is achieved: this may take weeks to months on the centimetre-sized samples on which measurements are performed. However, in most subsurface applications where the two phases reside for many years, equilibrium can be achieved. We demonstrate that in this case, two-phase displacement in porous media needs to be modelled as percolation without trapping. A pore network model is used to quantify how to convert measurements made ignoring Ostwald ripening to correct trapped saturation, capillary pressure and relative permeability to account for this effect. We show that conventional measurements over-estimate the amount of capillary trapping by 20-25\%.</description>

      <title>Expressing turbulent kinetic energy as coarse-grained enstrophy or strain deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In turbulent flows, the element of fluid gets deformed by chaotic motion due to the formation of sharp velocity gradients. A direct connection between the element of fluid stresses and the energy balance still remains elusive. Here, an exact identity of incompressible turbulence is derived linking the velocity gradient norm across the scales to the total kinetic energy. In the context of three dimensional (3D) homogeneous turbulence, this relation can be specialised obtaining the expression of total kinetic energy decomposed either in terms of fluid element deformations due to strain motion or via the resolved scale enstrophy. Applied to data from direct numerical simulations (DNS), the decomposition reveals that, beyond the scales dominated by the external forcing, extensional and contractile deformations account approximately for 55% and 40% of the kinetic energy of the associated scale saturating to these values at the small scales; less than the remaining 5% is carried by the indefinite-type ones. From both these two identities one can derive an exact expression of the omni-directional energy spectrum which is formulated via an ultraviolet-infrared mixing of scales. Data from DNS indicated that this formulation of the energy spectrum reproduces both analytically and numerically the power-law behaviour of the well known Kolmogorov spectral scaling.</description>

      <title>Mesh Neural Networks for SE(3)-Equivariant Hemodynamics Estimation on the Artery Wall</title>

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a valuable asset for patient-specific cardiovascular-disease diagnosis and prognosis, but its high computational demands hamper its adoption in practice. Machine-learning methods that estimate blood flow in individual patients could accelerate or replace CFD simulation to overcome these limitations. In this work, we consider the estimation of vector-valued quantities on the wall of three-dimensional geometric artery models. We employ group equivariant graph convolution in an end-to-end SE(3)-equivariant neural network that operates directly on triangular surface meshes and makes efficient use of training data. We run experiments on a large dataset of synthetic coronary arteries and find that our method estimates directional wall shear stress (WSS) with an approximation error of 7.6% and normalised mean absolute error (NMAE) of 0.4% while up to two orders of magnitude faster than CFD. Furthermore, we show that our method is powerful enough to accurately predict transient, vector-valued WSS over the cardiac cycle while conditioned on a range of different inflow boundary conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of our proposed method as a plugin replacement for CFD in the personalised prediction of hemodynamic vector and scalar fields.</description>

      <title>GPU-Native Adaptive Mesh Refinement with Application to Lattice Boltzmann Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has garnered significant interest in General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming for computational fluid dynamics due to its straightforward GPU parallelization. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) can assist in efficiently resolving flows with regions of interest requiring a high degree of resolution while providing a means of coarsening when this degree of resolution is no longer needed at runtime. AMR is commonly implemented in parallel on the CPU or in a hybrid frameworks with GPU-acceleration rather than natively on the GPU due to lack of a recursive data structure. An AMR scheme that could manage a computational mesh entirely on the GPU without intermediate data transfers to/from the host device would provide a substantial speedup, however, this is tackled scarcely in the literature and open-source codes are not available. Consequently, the LBM with AMR continues to be parallelized in hybrid frameworks in recent literature. The current work addresses these two concerns: 1) a block-based GPU-native algorithm is developed for AMR in two- and three-dimensions and implemented in an open-source C++ code, and 2) a Lattice Boltzmann solver for incompressible hydrodynamic flows is constructed and equipped to the mesh. Although the implementation is tailored for LBM simulations, the outlined grid refinement procedure is compatible with other solvers over cell-centered block-based grids. Validation for three choices of velocity set and analysis of performance in terms of solver speed with single- and double-precision, fraction of time communicating between grids, and fraction of time in refinement are conducted using the lid-driven cavity and flow past a square cylinder test cases. Consumer- and datacenter-grade GPUs are both used to run the test cases in order to demonstrate versatility of the algorithm.

      <title>Quantum-like behavior of an active particle in a double-well potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A macroscopic, self-propelled wave-particle entity (WPE) that emerges as a walking droplet on the surface of a vibrating liquid bath exhibits several hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We explore the rich dynamical and quantum-like features emerging in a model of an idealized one-dimensional wave-particle entity in a double-well potential. The integro-differential equation of motion for the WPE transforms to a Lorenz-like system, which we explore in detail. We observe the analog of quantized eigenstates as discrete limit cycles that arise by varying the width of the double-well potential, and also in the form of multistability with coexisting limit cycles. These states show narrow as well as wide energy level splitting. Tunneling-like behavior is also observed where the WPE erratically transitions between the two wells of the double-well potential. We rationalize this phenomena in terms of crisis-induced intermittency. Further, we discover a fractal structure in the escape time distribution of the particle from a well based on initial conditions, indicating unpredictability of this tunneling-like intermittent behavior at all scales. The chaotic intermittent dynamics lead to wave-like emergent features in the probability distribution of particle's position that show qualitative similarity with its quantum counterpart. Lastly, rich dynamical features are also observed such as a period doubling route to chaos as well as self-similar periodic islands in the chaotic parameter set.</description>

      <title>Photochemically-induced acousto-optics in gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acousto-optics consists of launching acoustic waves in a medium (usually a crystal) in order to modulate its refractive index and create a tunable optical grating. In this article, we present the theoretical basis of a new scheme to generate acousto-optics in a gas, where the acoustic waves are initiated by the localized absorption (and thus gas heating) of spatially-modulated UV light, as was demonstrated in Y. Michine and H. Yoneda, Commun. Phys. 3, 24 (2020). We identify the chemical reactions initiated by the absorption of UV light via the photodissociation of ozone molecules present in the gas, and calculate the resulting temperature increase in the gas as a function of space and time. Solving the Euler fluid equations shows that the modulated, isochoric heating initiates a mixed acoustic/entropy wave in the gas, whose high-amplitude density (and thus refractive index) modulation can be used to manipulate a high-power laser. We calculate that diffraction efficiencies near 100% can be obtained using only a few millimeters of gas containing a few percent ozone fraction at room temperature, with UV fluences of less than 100 mJ/cm2, consistent with the experimental measurements. Our analysis suggests possible ways to optimize the diffraction efficiency by changing the buffer gas composition. Gases have optics damage thresholds two to three orders of magnitude beyond those of solids; these optical elements should therefore be able to manipulate kJ-class lasers.</description>
