      <title>The Functor of Points Approach to Schemes in Cubical Agda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalization of quasi-compact and quasi-separated schemes (qcqs-schemes) in the Cubical Agda proof assistant. We follow Grothendieck's functor of points approach, which defines schemes, the quintessential notion of modern algebraic geometry, as certain well-behaved functors from commutative rings to sets. This approach is often regarded as conceptually simpler than the standard approach of defining schemes as locally ringed spaces, but to our knowledge it has not yet been adopted in formalizations of algebraic geometry. We build upon a previous formalization of the so-called Zariski lattice associated to a commutative ring in order to define the notion of compact open subfunctor. This allows for a concise definition of qcqs-schemes, streamlining the usual presentation as e.g. given in the standard textbook of Demazure and Gabriel. It also lets us obtain a fully constructive proof that compact open subfunctors of affine schemes are qcqs-schemes.</description>

      <title>The Kawamata-Morrison Cone Conjecture for Generalized Hyperelliptic Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Generalized Hyperelliptic Variety (GHV) is the quotient of an abelian variety by a free action of a finite group which does not contain any translation. These varieties are natural generalizations of bi-elliptic surfaces. In this paper we prove the Kawamata-Morrison Cone Conjecture for these manifolds using the analogous results established by Prendergast-Smith for abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Singular plane curves and their interplay with algebra and combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey we focus on various aspects of singular complex plane curves, mostly in the context of their homological properties and the associated combinatorial structures. We formulate some demanding open problems that can indicate new directions in research, for instance by introducing weak Ziegler pairs of curve arrangements.</description>

      <title>Derived categories of quartic double fivefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct singular quartic double fivefolds whose Kuznetsov component admits a crepant categorical resolution of singularities by a twisted Calabi--Yau threefold. We also construct rational specializations of these fivefolds where such a resolution exists without a twist. This confirms an instance of a higher-dimensional version of Kuznetsov's rationality conjecture, and of a noncommutative version of Reid's fantasy on the connectedness of the moduli of Calabi--Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>Paving Matroids: Defining Equations and Associated Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study paving matroids, their realization spaces, and their closures, along with matroid varieties and circuit varieties. Within this context, we introduce three distinct methods for generating polynomials within the associated ideals of these varieties across any dimension. Additionally, we explain the relationship between polynomials constructed using these different methods. We then compute a comprehensive and finite set of defining equations for matroid varieties associated with specific classes of paving matroids. Finally, we focus on the class of paving matroids of rank $3$, known as point-line configurations, which essentially contain simple matroids of rank $3$. Furthermore, we provide a decomposition for the associated circuit variety of point-line configurations, where all points have a degree less than $3$. Lastly, we present several examples applying our results and compare them with the known cases in the literature.</description>

      <title>Singular equivalence and singular locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a commutative Gorenstein Noetherian ring $R$, we construct an affine scheme $X$ solely from singularity category $D_{sg}(R)$ of $R$ such that there is a finite surjective morphism $X \rightarrow \mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$, where $\mathrm{Spec}(R /I)$ is the singular locus in $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. As an application, for two such rings with equivalent singularity categories, we prove that the singular loci in their affine schemes have the same dimension.</description>

      <title>Equivariant K-theory and refined Vafa-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.00078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [MT2] the Vafa-Witten theory of complex projective surfaces is lifted to oriented $\mathbb C^*$-equivariant cohomology theories. Here we study the K-theoretic refinement. It gives rational functions in $t^{1/2}$ invariant under $t^{1/2}\leftrightarrow t^{-1/2}$ which specialise to numerical Vafa-Witten invariants at $t=1$. On the "instanton branch" the invariants give the virtual $\chi_{-t}^{}$-genus refinement of G\"ottsche-Kool. Applying modularity to their calculations gives predictions for the contribution of the "monopole branch". We calculate some cases and find perfect agreement. We also do calculations on K3 surfaces, finding Jacobi forms refining the usual modular forms, proving a conjecture of G\"ottsche-Kool. We determine the K-theoretic virtual classes of degeneracy loci using Eagon-Northcott complexes, and show they calculate refined Vafa-Witten invariants. Using this Laarakker [Laa] proves universality results for the invariants.</description>

      <title>Regularized Integrals on Configuration Spaces of Riemann Surfaces and Cohomological Pairings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the notion of regularized integrals introduced by Li-Zhou that aims to assign finite values to divergent integrals on configuration spaces of Riemann surfaces. We then give cohomological formulations for the extended notion using the tools of current cohomology and mixed Hodge structures. We also provide practical ways of constructing representatives of the corresponding cohomology classes in terms of smooth differential forms.</description>

      <title>K-stability and large complex structure limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how, under suitable assumptions, a K\"ahler test configuration admits a mirror Landau-Ginzburg model, giving a corresponding expression for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant as a residue pairing. We study the general behaviour of such mirror formulae under large scaling of the K\"ahler form. We exploit the observation that this scaling trivially preserves $K$-stability, but takes the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model to a large complex structure limit. In certain cases the mirror formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant simplify in this limit. We focus on a special type of limiting behaviour, when the Donaldson-Futaki invariant concentrates at a single critical point of the Landau-Ginzburg potential, and show that this leads to new formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant in terms of theta functions on the mirror. We provide a main application, which shows that such limiting behaviour actually occurs for test configurations in several nontrivial examples, both toric and non-toric, in the case of slope (in)stability for polarised surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the singular locus of $\mathrm{Sec} (X^{[2]})$ coincides with $X^{[2]}$ under the Grothendieck-Pl\"ucker embedding $X^{[2]} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^N$ when $X$ is embedded by a $4$-very ample line bundle. We also prove that the embedding $X^{[2]} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^N$ satisfies Green's condition $(N_p)$ when the embedding of $X$ is positive enough. As an application, we describe the geometry of a resolution of singularities from the secant bundle to $\mathrm{Sec}(X^{[2]})$ when $X$ is a surface.</description>

      <title>Ewald's Conjecture and integer points in algebraic and symplectic toric geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve several open problems concerning integer points of polytopes arising in symplectic and algebraic geometry. In this direction we give the first proof of a broad case of Ewald's Conjecture (1988) concerning symmetric integral points of monotone lattice polytopes in arbitrary dimension. We also include an asymptotic quantitative study of the set of points appearing in Ewald's Conjecture. Then we relate this work to the problem of displaceability of orbits in symplectic toric geometry. We conclude with a proof for the $2$-dimensional case, and for a number of cases in higher dimensions, of Nill's Conjecture (2009), which is a generalization of Ewald's conjecture to smooth lattice polytopes. Along the way the paper introduces two new classes of polytopes which arise naturally in the study of Ewald's Conjecture and symplectic displaceability: neat polytopes, which are related to Oda's Conjecture, and deeply monotone polytopes.</description>
