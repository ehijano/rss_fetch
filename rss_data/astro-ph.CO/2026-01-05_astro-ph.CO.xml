      <title>Isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background reconstruction for Taiji constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background is a broadband target from diverse astrophysical and cosmological sources. The background falls within the mHz frequency band could become a potential observable for future space-based interferometers. Taiji, a proposed space mission slated for launch in the 2030s, will enable the study of such a background. However, the unique characteristics of space missions pose distinctive challenges for separating the stochastic background from instrumental noise. To address the data analysis requirements, we develop a preliminary pipeline to search for the SGWB and evaluate its performance with Taiji simulation datasets. At present, we demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully recover the parameters of injected background with a known spectral density after setting aside the complication of galactic binaries foreground. Furthermore, by employing the trans-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we extend the analysis to reconstruct the background with unknown spectral morphology.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the extragalactic background light at 8600\r{A} using dark cloud shadow and the CaII-triplet lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a measurement of the near infrared Extragalactic Background Light using the dark-cloud method. Long-slit spectra covering the opaque core of the intermediate--latitude globule DC303.8-14.2 and the almost unobscured off area were measured using nodding-along-the-slit measuring technique providing a differential spectrum free of most of the foreground components. A template for the only remaining major foreground component, the scattered integrated starlight dominated by the strong Ca II triplet lines at 8498, 8542, 8664$\r{A}$, from the dark core itself was constructed using the GAIA RVS spectral database. The derived EBL intensity is $1.62\pm 0.76(\sigma_{stat})\, 10^{-9} erg\, cm^{-2} s^{-1}\r{A}^{-1} sr^{-1}$ or $13.8\pm6.5(\sigma_{stat})$nW m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$; this represents a tentative detection at $2.1\sigma$, level.</description>

      <title>Constraining Primordial Black Holes via p-wave annihilation in light of CMB Spectral Distortion and 21-cm global signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form spike density halos through the accretion of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). In these halos, the enhanced density significantly boosts the annihilation rate of WIMPs. For Majorana dark matter annihilation into light fermions, the s-wave part of the annihilation cross section is helicity-suppressed, making the p-wave contribution dominant. We study the velocity-dependent p-wave annihilation case, whose resulting energy injection can modify the thermal and ionization history of the Universe, leaving observable imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum and the global 21-cm signal. From the predicted energy injection into the plasma, we derive stringent upper limits on the fraction of dark matter in form of PBHs for p-wave annihilation models, based on the observational constraints of the CMB spectral distortions ($y$-type), and from the measurement of the 21-cm absorption signal at cosmic dawn. Our results highlight that accounting for the p-wave nature of annihilation is crucial for deriving robust constraints on the PBH abundance.</description>

      <title>Fisher Forecasts for Cosmological Yields from $3\!\times\!2$pt Analysis of the Roman Space Telescope High Latitude Imaging Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide powerful tests of cosmological models through sensitive measurements of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL), and galaxy clustering. As part of the HLIS Project Infrastructure Team's Data Challenge 1 (DC1), we carry out Fisher forecasts of cosmological parameter constraints from combinations of these probes, focusing on inverse-variance figures of merit (FoMs) for the parameters $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$, which scale the amplitude of weak lensing signals. We find good agreement between Fisher analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of the DC1 baseline data vector, and we exploit the flexibility of Fisher analysis to investigate varied priors on cosmological parameters and on nuisance parameters describing unknown biases in photometric redshifts or shear measurements. Given the benchmark DC1 priors, the forecast constraints from GGL+clustering are substantially stronger than those from cosmic shear, with the combination of all three probes (``$3\!\times\!2$pt'') providing moderate further improvement. Adding tight external priors on the power spectrum shape parameters $n_{\rm{s}}$, $\Omega_{\rm{b}}$, and $h_0$ can improve the $(\sigma_8, \Omega_{\rm{m}})$ FoMs by factors of $1.2$--$3.5$. The smallest scale angular bins provide much more information than the largest scale bins, and the highest redshift tomographic bins provide more information than the lowest redshift bins. Factor-of-two changes in the priors on photo-$z$ and shear biases, relative to the benchmark values based on anticipated calibration accuracy, produce changes of $\lesssim 20\%$ in FoMs, implying robust cosmological performance if this demanding level of accuracy can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Late Time Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Scalar Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that Dark Matter is an ultralight scalar field which is coupled to electromagnetism via a gauge-kinetic function and which at the time of recombination is oscillating coherently over a Hubble patch, we show that there is a tachyonic instability for the gauge field modes which leads to the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales of sufficient amplitude to explain observations.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Resolution of the Hubble Tension in CPL Cosmology with Massive Neutrinos via Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the Hubble constant within the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), focusing on the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and its dynamical dark energy extensions described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, both with and without massive neutrinos. By embedding the cosmological background equations directly into a Bayesian PINN architecture, we reconstruct the Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ in a data-driven yet physically consistent manner, while rigorously propagating epistemic uncertainties. Our analysis combines late-time observational probes, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO DESI DR2), and the Pantheon supernova sample, and quantifies the resulting tension in the inferred Hubble constant with respect to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and the SH0ES (R22) local distance ladder measurement. Within $\Lambda$CDM, we find that data combinations involving BAO tend to favor lower values of $H_0$, alleviating the tension with Planck at the expense of increased disagreement with SH0ES. Allowing for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state in the CPL framework systematically shifts the posterior of $H_0$ toward higher values, leading to a notable reduction of the SH0ES tension, particularly for combinations including supernova data. The most flexible scenario, CPL with a free total neutrino mass $\Sigma m_\nu$, yields a balanced reconciliation between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, with tension levels typically reduced to the $\sim1$-$2\sigma$ range relative to both Planck and SH0ES. Our results highlight the nontrivial interplay between dark energy dynamics and neutrino mass in addressing the Hubble tension and demonstrate the efficacy of Bayesian PINNs as a robust and versatile tool for precision cosmology beyond the standard paradigm.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: The morphologies of clusters of galaxies: II. The intrinsic distributions of morphological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray selected surveys of clusters of galaxies have been reported to contain more regular cool core clusters compared to samples selected using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. Morphology population studies on X-ray selected clusters will be biased without taking into account selection, as cool cores are more easily detected at low redshifts, but can be mistaken for point sources at high redshift. eROSITA, aboard SRG, found over 12000 optically-identified clusters in its first survey, eRASS1. Taking account of the selection function obtained from simulations, we obtain using a Bayesian framework the intrinsic distribution of morphological parameters, including the concentration, central density, cuspiness, ellipticity and slosh. We construct scaling relations for the parameters as a function of redshift (z) and luminosity (LX), and study their distribution within z or LX bins. We find that the concentration in a scaled aperture evolves positively with LX, similarly to the central scaled density, and negatively with z. When using a fixed aperture, its evolution with LX is lower, but also dependent on the choice of cluster centre. The mean ellipticity does not significantly evolve with z or LX. eRASS1 clusters show indications of higher concentrations compared to SZ-selected objects, even after taking account the selection; this suggests that if our X-ray selection model is correct SZ-selected clusters may also suffer from morphological selection effects. We compare different parameter distribution models in bins of z and LX. The distribution of concentration and ellipticity is generally consistent with a normal one, but other parameters such as the central density and cuspiness strongly favour more complex distributions. However, modelling of all clusters as a single population generally prefers non-normal distributions. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Hubble tension: Insights from a diverse set of Sound Horizon-free H0 measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is commonly framed as a discrepancy between local, late-time measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 73$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and early-time, Sound-Horizon-based measurements favoring $H_0 \approx 67$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We challenge this viewpoint by analyzing 83 Sound-Horizon-independent $H_0$ measurements, categorized into four classes: Distance Ladder measurements using local calibrators; Local One-Step $\Lambda$CDM measurements assuming the standard expansion history; Pure Local One-Step measurements independent of $H(z)$ shape; and CMB Sound Horizon free measurements using CMB data without the Sound Horizon scale. We find that the 29 Distance Ladder measurements yield $H_0 = 72.74 \pm 0.40$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu \equiv \chi^2/d.o.f= 0.74$), while the 54 One-Step measurements collectively yield $H_0 = 68.67 \pm 0.46$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.85$), a $6.7\sigma$ tension exceeding the Planck--SH0ES discrepancy. This tension remains significant at $4.5\sigma$ after accounting for correlations. Among One-Step categories, Local One-Step $\Lambda$CDM measurements favor the lowest value ($H_0 = 67.18 \pm 0.90$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), Pure Local One-Step yield an intermediate value ($H_0 = 70.38 \pm 1.00$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and CMB Sound Horizon Free measurements give $H_0 = 68.71 \pm 0.63$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Thus, that the Hubble tension is better characterized as a discrepancy between the Distance Ladder and all other methodologies, rather than an early-vs-late-time split. We also identify a $2.4\sigma$ internal tension among One-Step measurements: analyses assuming $\Lambda$CDM systematically recover lower $H_0$ values by about 3.2 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ compared to model-independent methods. This suggests either unrecognized systematics/physics in the Distance Ladder or deviations from $\Lambda$CDM in the late-time Universe.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Imprints in the Lyman-Alpha Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy (DE) remains elusive, even though it constitutes the dominant energy-density component of the Universe and drives the late-time acceleration of cosmic expansion. By combining measurements of the expansion history from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernova surveys, and cosmic microwave background data, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has inferred that the DE equation of state may evolve over time. The profound implications of a time-variable, ``dynamical" DE (DDE) that departs from a cosmological constant motivate the need for independent observational tests. In this work, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to investigate how DDE affects the properties of the Lyman-Alpha ``forest'' of absorption features produced by neutral hydrogen in the cosmic web. We find that DDE models consistent with the DESI constraints induce a spectral tilt in the forest transmitted flux power spectrum, imprinting a scale- and redshift-dependent signature relative to standard Lambda-CDM cosmologies. These models also yield higher intergalactic medium temperatures and reduced Lyman-Alpha opacity compared to Lambda-CDM. We discuss the observational implications of these trends as potential avenues for independent confirmation of DDE.</description>

      <title>Dark Recipe for the First Giants: From Population III Stars to Early Supermassive Black Holes via Dark Matter Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts ($z&gt;5$), as revealed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), challenges standard black hole (BH) formation scenarios. We propose a mechanism in which non-annihilating dark matter (DM) with non-gravitational interactions with the Standard Model (SM) particles accumulates inside Population III (Pop III) stars, inducing their premature collapse into BH seeds having the same mass as the parent star. Owing to their early formation, these seeds can accrete for longer periods and grow into the SMBHs observed at early cosmic times. Focusing on spin-dependent (SD) DM-proton interactions, we identify regions of parameter space that account for the observed high-redshift SMBH population, their mass function, and the SMBH-stellar mass relation. Portions of this parameter space are testable by forthcoming direct detection experiments. The scenario may lead to distinctive gravitational wave (GW) signatures from SMBH mergers, accessible to Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and pulsar timing array (PTA) observations.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in leptogenesis without the need for right-handed neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimentally testable leptogenesis mechanism based on the standard type-I seesaw model that successfully operates at right-handed-neutrino (RHN) masses around the GeV scale. The mechanism takes place in a cosmological background with an asymmetry between right-handed electrons and left-handed positrons generated at high temperatures, and does not require oscillations between RHNs or any CP violation in the RHN sector. In contrast to standard leptogenesis via freeze-in, our mechanism works even in the presence of a single RHN around the GeV scale. The mechanism is illustrated for the minimal type-I seesaw with two RHNs, where we show that successful baryogenesis via leptogenesis is viable in large regions of parameter space even without a small mass splitting between the RHNs.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots: The Assembly of Early Supermassive Black Holes in the JWST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021, our understanding of high-redshift objects has faced several upheavals. JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point-like morphology, these ``little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star-forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim4)$. In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub-millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet \&amp; optical measurements provided by JWST. Furthermore, we highlight how identifying additional LRD that are truly primarily SMBH-driven may help to shed light on the formation of `overly massive' SMBH discovered by JWST within the first billion years since the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Metric Reconstruction and Second Order Perturbation for Generic Spherically Symmetric spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order perturbations during the ringdown phase are essential for testing gravitational theories. This requires a perturbation framework that extends beyond General Relativity, as well as an appropriate method for reconstructing the spacetime metric. In this work, we address these challenges within the context of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. We introduce a modified Teukolsky equation for perturbative calculations in asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric spacetimes. The metric reconstruction method, which does not rely on the Hertz potential, is extended to $tr$-symmetric spacetime, allowing for the calculation of metric components under specific gauge conditions. Additionally, we present a second-order perturbation theory applicable to generic spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Tails and Transient Behaviors of Quantum-Corrected Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy plays a pivotal role in testing the dynamics of gravity in strong-field regimes and probing the nature of black holes. Motivated by recent studies on late-time tails in gravitational waves, we examine the gravitational wave tails of black holes incorporating quantum corrections within the framework of effective Loop Quantum Gravity. Our findings indicate that both the amplitudes and the intermediate behavior of these tails are influenced by quantum corrections. We demonstrate that the amplitude and transient characteristics of the tail are sensitive to the specific details of the black hole's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of RHN DM relic in the vanilla scotogenic neutrino mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scotogeneic neutrino mass models are very popular choices to generate light neutrino masses via radiative mechanism. In these models, the particles running in the loop are distinguished from the standard model due to an imposed $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the loop particles are odd. Therefore, the lightest particle running in the loop can be a viable dark matter candidate. In this paper, we revisit the minimal scotogenic neutrino mass model and study the anatomy of right handed neutrino (RHN) DM relic, taking into account contributions from self-annihilation, co-annihilation, conversion-driven processes, as well as production via the freeze-in mechanism. We impose the constraints from direct detection and collider searches of DM including anomalous magnetic moment of muon, charged lepton flavor violation and low-energy neutrino oscillation data to show that the lightest RHN can be a viable DM in the mass range: $M_{h}/2\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim2000 {\rm GeV}$ (thermal DM) and $0.1 ~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim 1000 {\rm GeV}$ (non-thermal DM), where $M_h$ denotes the Standard Model Higgs mass and $M_{\rm DM}$ is the RHN dark matter mass. We also find the displaced vertex signatures of long lived particles which can be probed at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Lines and Excitation of (Nearly) Double-Pole Quasinormal Modes: A Semi-Analytic Study in the Nariai Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar field in Kerr-de Sitter and Myers-Perry black holes exhibit an exceptional line (EL), which is a continuous set of exceptional points (EPs) in parameter space, at which two QNM frequencies and their associated solutions coincide. We find that the EL appears in the parameter space spanned by the scalar mass and the black hole spin parameter, and also in the Nariai limit, i.e., $r_{\rm c} - r_{\rm h} \to 0$, where $r_{\rm c}$ and $r_{\rm h}$ denote the radii of the cosmological and black hole horizons, respectively. We analytically study the amplitudes or excitation factors of QNMs near the EL. Such an analytic treatment becomes possible since, in the Nariai limit, the perturbation equation reduces to a wave equation with the P\"{o}schl-Teller (PT) potential. We discuss the destructive excitation of QNMs and the stability of the ringdown near and at the EL. The transient linear growth of QNMs -- a characteristic excitation pattern near an EP or EL -- together with the conditions under which this linear growth dominates the early ringdown, is also studied analytically. Our conditions apply to a broad class of systems that involve the excitation of (nearly) double-pole QNMs.</description>

      <title>Dark Dimension Right-handed Neutrinos Confronted with Long-Baseline Oscillation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Right-handed neutrinos are naturally induced by dark extra dimension models and play an essential role in neutrino oscillations. The model parameters can be examined by the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work, we compute the predicted neutrino oscillation spectra within/without extra dimension models and compare them with the experimental data. We find that the neutrino data in the T2K and NOvA experiments are compatible with the standard neutrino oscillation hypothesis. The results set the stringent exclusion limit on the extra dimension model parameters at a high confidence level. The derived constraints on dark dimension right-handed neutrinos are complementary to those results from the collider experiments and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy models in light of the latest observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study several models and parameterizations of dynamical dark energy (DE) that have been studied already in the past, in conjunction with the recently proposed model $w$XCDM, the running vacuum model (RVM) with and without a threshold at $z=1$ and two variants of it, the RRVM and the ``flipped RVM'', and compare them all with the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and the popular $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization. We use two standard sets of cosmological data, one including distant supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and the other from DES-Y5. The rest of the data (BAO from DESI DR2 and CMB from Planck PR4) are shared by the two sets. They are analyzed with the help of \texttt{CLASS}. No structure formation data are utilized for this analysis and no use is made of the SH0ES calibration of $H_0$. Even so, we find that the flipped RVM and to a lesser extent the $w$XCDM and the RVM with threshold, point to significant evidence of dynamical DE, at a level comparable to $w_0w_a$CDM, more conspicuously for the dataset that involves DES-Y5 observations. We also find that while more traditional models studied in the past, in which there is an exchange between vacuum energy and cold dark matter (through e.g. an interactive source proportional either to the density of dark matter or to that of vacuum) still hint at dynamical DE, the strength of the statistical signal (which we assess through information criteria and other estimators) is nevertheless less pronounced. Finally, we discuss the ability of the various models to explain the data by performing an analysis of their effective equation-of-state parameters and corresponding evolution of their dark energy densities.</description>

      <title>Feeling Blue: Constructing a Robust SALT3 UV Template and Constraining its Redshift Dependency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming cosmological surveys will obtain numerous rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), yet there is concern about how standardizable SNe Ia are in the UV. In this work, we train a robust optical--UV SED model for SNe Ia (SALT3-UV) with the open-source model-training software $\texttt{SALTshaker}$. We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, including 67 UV spectra from 18 nearby SNe Ia. Unlike previous training spectra, the HST spectra have sufficiently precise calibration that they do not require additional warping to match coincident photometric data. Additionally, while including this new SN Ia sample necessitates incorporating auxiliary photometric data from ZTF and ATLAS that have insufficient calibration for cosmological analyses, the improvements in the calibration of these data is anticipated in the near future. Compared to the previous SALT3-K21 model, the SALT3-UV model shows a significant improvement in the UV down to $2000\mathring{\text{A}}$, with over a threefold improvement in model uncertainty and a more physically accurate continuum and line features. We further evaluate potential redshift evolution in the UV template by separating the UV training sample into low- and high-$z$ subsamples. Our results reveal a non-negligible $\gtrsim 0.05$ mag difference between low- and high-$z$ SALT3-UV models in the $g-$band at $z\gtrsim0.5$ and the $u-$band at $z\gtrsim0.2$. We demonstrate that, if confirmed, such evolution could lead to a few-percent bias in the measurement of $w$ if high-$z$ rest-frame UV data are included in future cosmological surveys such as LSST and $\textit{Roman}$.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XIX. Measuring stellar velocity dispersion with sub-percent accuracy for cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of massive elliptical galaxies is a key ingredient in breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy and obtaining precise and accurate cosmography from gravitational time delays. The relative uncertainty on the Hubble constant H$_0$ is double the relative error on $\sigma$. Therefore, time-delay cosmography imposes much more demanding requirements on the precision and accuracy of $\sigma$ than galaxy studies. While precision can be achieved with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the accuracy critically depends on key factors such as the elemental abundance and temperature of stellar templates, flux calibration, and wavelength ranges. We carried out a detailed study of the problem using multiple sets of
  galaxy spectra of massive elliptical galaxies with S/N$\sim$30--160 \AA$^{-1}$, along with state-of-the-art empirical and semi-empirical stellar libraries and stellar population synthesis templates. We show that the choice of stellar library is generally the dominant source of residual systematic errors. We propose a general recipe for mitigating and accounting for residual uncertainties. We show that a sub-percent level of accuracy can be achieved on individual spectra with our data quality, which we subsequently validated with simulated mock datasets. The covariance between velocity dispersions measured for a sample of spectra can also be reduced to sub-percent levels. We recommend this recipe for all applications that require high precision and accurate stellar kinematics. Thus, we have made all the software publicly available to facilitate its implementation. This recipe will also be used in future TDCOSMO collaboration papers.</description>

      <title>Single-Point Search for eV-scale Axion-like particles with Variable-Angle Three-Beam Stimulated Resonant Photon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a laboratory search for axion-like particles (ALPs) in the eV-mass range using a variable-angle three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider. The scheme independently focuses and collides three laser beams, providing a cosmology- and astrophysics-independent test. By varying the angles of incidence, the center-of-mass energy can be scanned continuously across the eV range. In this work, we operated the collider in a vacuum chamber at a large-angle configuration, verified the spacetime overlap of the three short pulses, and performed a first search centered at $m_a\simeq 2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. No excess was observed. We thus set a $95\%$ C.L.\ upper limit on the pseudoscalar two-photon coupling, with a minimum sensitivity of $g/M\simeq 4.2\times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at $m_a=2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. This provides the first model-independent upper limit on the coupling that reaches the KSVZ benchmark in the eV regime and demonstrates the feasibility of eV-scale mass scans in the near future.</description>

      <title>Physical Effects of Gravitational Waves at Second Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.</description>
