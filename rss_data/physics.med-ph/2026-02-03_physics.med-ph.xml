      <title>Multi-Compartment Volume Conductor with Complete Electrode Model: Simulated Stereo-EEG Source Localization using Brainstorm-Zeffiro Plugin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel integration of the Brainstorm (BST) software and the Zeffiro Interface (ZI) to enable whole-head, multi-compartment volume conductor modeling for electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging, with a particular focus on stereotactic EEG applications. We present the BST-2-ZI plugin, a MATLAB-based tool that facilitates seamless transfer of tissue segmentations and anatomical atlases from BST into ZI for finite element (FE) mesh generation as well as forward and inverse modeling. The generated FE meshes support variable spatial resolution and implement the complete electrode model (CEM), allowing for precise modeling of both invasive depth electrodes and non-invasive scalp electrodes. Using the ICBM152 template and synthetic source simulation, we demonstrate the end-to-end pipeline from MRI data to lead field (LF) computation and source localization in a stereotactic EEG (stereo-EEG) setting. Our numerical experiments highlight the capability of the pipeline to accurately model multi-compartment head geometry and conductivity with a stereotactic CEM-based electrode configuration. Our preliminary source localization results show how a synthetic stereo-EEG probe corresponding to a bidirectional deep brain stimulation (DBS) probe with four omnidirectional contacts can, in principle, be coupled with scalp electrodes to improve source localization in its vicinity.</description>

      <title>The Contrast Order: An Order-Based Image Quality Criterion for Nonlinear Beamformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern ultrasound beamformers report improved image quality when evaluated using classical criteria like the contrast ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio, which are based on summary statistics of regions of interest (ROIs). However, nonlinear beamformers and post-processing methods can substantially alter these statistics, raising concerns that the reported improvements may reflect changes in dynamic range or remapping rather than a reflection of true information gain, such as clutter suppression. New criteria like the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) address these concerns, but rely on noisy estimates of the underlying distribution. To address this, we introduce a new image quality criterion, called the contrast order (CO), defined as the expected value of the sign of the difference in brightness between two ROIs. The CO is invariant under all strictly monotonic transformations of the image values, as it depends only on their relative ordering, and is interpretable as the probability that one ROI is brighter than the other minus the probability that it is darker. Unlike the gCNR, the CO has a simple unbiased estimator whose variance decreases with the number of samples in each ROI. We further propose the effective contrast ratio (ECR), which calibrates the contrast order to the familiar contrast ratio such that the two coincide under ideal Rayleigh-speckle statistics. Together, the CO and ECR provide order- and sign-preserving, dynamic-range-invariant criteria for evaluating lesion contrast, offering a principled alternative to classical and newer image quality criteria when assessing modern beamformers.</description>

      <title>Effects of PLGA coating on biological and mechanical behaviors of tissue engineering scaffolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaffolds have a key role in the clinical success of tissue engineering for the regeneration of damaged tissues. Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Differential Pathlength Factor Model for Near-Infrared Diffuse Optical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near infrared diffuse optical imaging can be performed in reflectance and transmission mode and relies on physical models along with measurements to extract information on changes in chromophore concentration. Continuous-wave near-infrared diffuse optical imaging relies on accurate differential pathlength factors (DPFs) for quantitative chromophore estimation. Existing DPF definitions inherit formulation-dependent limitations that can introduce large errors in modified Beer--Lambert law analyses. These errors are significantly higher at smaller source-detector separations in a reflectance mode of measurement. This minimizes their applicability in situations where large area detection is used and also when signal depth is varying. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we derive two distance- and property-dependent DPF models one ideal and one experimentally practical and benchmark them against standard formulations. The proposed models achieve errors below 10 percent across broad optical conditions, whereas conventional DPFs can exceed 100 percent error. The theoretical predictions are further validated using controlled phantom experiments, demonstrating improved quantitative accuracy in CW-NIR imaging.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Imaging Depth and Sensitivity in Reflectance Mode Near Infrared Optical Imaging with Scatter Reducing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of scatter reducing agents in a continuous wave (CW) near infrared (NIR)reflectance mode imaging setting. We use food-grade dye Tartrazine as a scatter reducing agent to enhance depth sensitivity and weak-absorber detectability in CW diffuse reflectance measurements. We found that reflectance signal was enhanced when the dye was applied on chicken breast phantom. However, we saw reduced reflectance sensitivity when the dye was uniformly dissolved in intralipid phantom which is a commonly used for NIR imaging studies. This shows that the gradient of refractive index modulation created as the dye diffuses from the top layer allows increased reflectance signal sensitivity of optical photons. However, when the scatter reduction is uniform throughout the phantom (like in intralipid phantom), the improved reflectance sensitivity was not observed. Our study points to significant redistribution of photons with scatter modulation with Tartrazine dye. We show significant improvement in sensitivity to signals with reflectance imaging. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of dye induced scatter reduction in tissue, analytical diffusion models and Monte Carlo simulations were employed. Modeling results show the impact of refractive index gradient created due to dye diffusion in enhancing reflectance sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that dye induced scatter reduction provides a practical, low-complexity approach to improving depth sensitivity in CW diffuse reflectance measurements and extend the functional capabilities of CW-NIRS systems for deep-tissue sensing applications. Our preliminary studies shows up to five fold enhancement in signal sensitivity for signals between two and three cm depth.</description>

      <title>Improving Neuropathological Reconstruction Fidelity via AI Slice Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuropathological analyses benefit from spatially precise volumetric reconstructions that enhance anatomical delineation and improve morphometric accuracy. Our prior work has shown the feasibility of reconstructing 3D brain volumes from 2D dissection photographs. However these outputs sometimes exhibit coarse, overly smooth reconstructions of structures, especially under high anisotropy (i.e., reconstructions from thick slabs). Here, we introduce a computationally efficient super-resolution step that imputes slices to generate anatomically consistent isotropic volumes from anisotropic 3D reconstructions of dissection photographs. By training on domain-randomized synthetic data, we ensure that our method generalizes across dissection protocols and remains robust to large slab thicknesses. The imputed volumes yield improved automated segmentations, achieving higher Dice scores, particularly in cortical and white matter regions. Validation on surface reconstruction and atlas registration tasks demonstrates more accurate cortical surfaces and MRI registration. By enhancing the resolution and anatomical fidelity of photograph-based reconstructions, our approach strengthens the bridge between neuropathology and neuroimaging. Our method is publicly available at https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_3d_photo_recon</description>

      <title>Multi-head automated segmentation by incorporating detection head into the contextual layer neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning based auto segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy, but conventional models often produce anatomically implausible false positives, or hallucinations, in slices lacking target structures. We propose a gated multi-head Transformer architecture based on Swin U-Net, augmented with inter-slice context integration and a parallel detection head, which jointly performs slice-level structure detection via a multi-layer perceptron and pixel-level segmentation through a context-enhanced stream. Detection outputs gate the segmentation predictions to suppress false positives in anatomically invalid slices, and training uses slice-wise Tversky loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Prostate-Anatomical-Edge-Cases dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive demonstrate that the gated model substantially outperforms a non-gated segmentation-only baseline, achieving a mean Dice loss of $0.013 \pm 0.036$ versus $0.732 \pm 0.314$, with detection probabilities strongly correlated with anatomical presence, effectively eliminating spurious segmentations. In contrast, the non-gated model exhibited higher variability and persistent false positives across all slices. These results indicate that detection-based gating enhances robustness and anatomical plausibility in automated segmentation applications, reducing hallucinated predictions without compromising segmentation quality in valid slices, and offers a promising approach for improving the reliability of clinical radiotherapy auto-contouring workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03010v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micron-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) to cellular-level tissue structure. Precision medicine and quantitative imaging depend on uncovering the information content of dMRI and establishing its parsimonious hardware-independent fingerprint. Based on the rotational SO(3) symmetry, we study the geometry of the dMRI signal and the topology of its acquisition, identify irreducible components and a full set of invariants for the cumulant tensors, and relate them to tissue properties. Including all kurtosis invariants improves multiple sclerosis classification in a cohort of 1189 subjects. We design the shortest acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices to determine the most used invariants in only 1-2 minutes for whole brain. Representing dMRI via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMRI into clinic.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the ISOLPHARM gamma camera for Ag-111 imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT) is a well-established technique for cancer treatment. In this approach, radionuclides are bound to specific drugs that selectively transport them to the tumor site. Within the ISOLPHARM project, a radiopharmaceutical for TRT based on the innovative radionuclide Ag-111 is currently under development. Ag-111 has a half-life of 7.45 days and decays by emitting both electrons and gamma-rays. The emission of gamma-rays, predominantly at an energy of 342 keV, enables the visualization of Ag-111 using a gamma camera. In this work, we describe a Monte Carlo simulation developed to optimize the design parameters of such an imaging device. The simulation is based on the Geant4 toolkit, which accurately models the interactions between particles and matter. The estimated spatial resolution and sensitivity of the system are approximately 4 mm and 19 cps/MBq, respectively. The simulated device is able to resolve lesions with a lesion-to-background activity ratio of 4:1 under in-vivo-like conditions. These results indicate that the proposed gamma camera can provide cost-effective imaging capabilities for preclinical radiopharmaceutical studies.</description>

      <title>OpenPros: A Large-Scale Dataset for Limited View Prostate Ultrasound Computed Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers among men, motivating the development of accurate and accessible imaging technologies for early detection. Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) reconstructs quantitative tissue parameters such as speed-of-sound (SOS) and is a promising low-cost alternative to existing modalities. However, prostate USCT remains challenging due to limited-angle acquisition, strong tissue heterogeneity, bone-induced wave distortion, and the lack of large-scale, anatomically realistic datasets for method development and evaluation. We introduce OPENPROS, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for limited-angle prostate USCT, designed to systematically evaluate machine learning methods for quantitative inverse problems. OPENPROS contains over 280,000 paired samples of realistic 2D SOS maps and corresponding ultrasound full-waveform data, generated from anatomically accurate 3D digital prostate models derived from 4 clinical MRI/CT scans and 62 ex vivo prostate specimens with experimental ultrasound measurements. Wave propagation is simulated under clinically realistic configurations using open-source finite-difference time-domain and Runge-Kutta solvers. We provide standardized training, in-distribution, and out-of-distribution benchmarks and evaluate representative deep learning baselines. While learning-based methods substantially improve inference speed and reconstruction accuracy over physics-based approaches, results highlight persistent challenges in robustness, generalization, and high-resolution reconstruction quality. By publicly releasing OPENPROS, we establish a rigorous benchmark to support research in inverse problems, physics-guided learning, and operator learning, and to bridge the gap between machine learning research and practical USCT deployment. The dataset is available at https://open-pros.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of a Position-Sensitive SiPM-based Gamma Camera for Intraoperative Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The POSiCS camera is a handheld, small field-of-view gamma camera developed for multipurpose use in radio-guided surgery (RGS), with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as its benchmark application. This compact and lightweight detector (weighing approximately 350 g) can map tissues labeled with Tc-99m nanocolloids and guide surgeons to the location of target lesions. By enabling intraoperative visualization in close proximity to the surgical field, its primary objective is to minimize surgical interventional invasiveness and operative time, thereby enhancing localization accuracy and reducing the incidence of post-operative complications. The design and components of the POSiCS camera emphasize ergonomic handling and compactness, providing, at the same time, rapid image formation and a spatial resolution of a few millimeters. These features are compatible with routine operating-room workflow, including wireless communication with the computer and a real-time display to support surgeon decision-making.
  The spatial resolution measured at a source-detector distance of 0 cm was 1.9 +/- 0.1 mm for the high-sensitivity mode and 1.4 +/- 0.1 mm for the high-resolution mode. The system sensitivity at 2 cm was evaluated as 481 +/- 14 cps/MBq (high sensitivity) and 134 +/- 8 cps/MBq (high resolution). For both working modes, we report an energy resolution of approximately 20 percent, even though the high-resolution collimator exhibits an increased scattered component due to the larger amount of tungsten.</description>
