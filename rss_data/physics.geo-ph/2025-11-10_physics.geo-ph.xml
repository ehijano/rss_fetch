      <title>Modelling dynamic strains on ice shelves resulting from flexural and extensional motions forced by ocean wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient response of an ice shelf to an incident wave packet from the open ocean is studied with a model that allows for extensional waves in the ice shelf, in addition to the standard flexural waves. Results are given for strains imposed on the ice shelf by the incident packet, over a range of peak periods in the swell regime and a range of packet widths. In spite of the large difference in speeds of the extensional and flexural waves, it is shown that there is generally an interval of time during which they interact, and the coherent phases of the interactions generate the greatest ice shelf strain magnitudes. The findings indicate that incorporating extensional waves into models is potentially important for predicting the response of Antarctic ice shelves to swell, in support of previous findings based on frequency-domain analysis.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of 10 - 50 MeV Solar Proton Events at Lagrange Point 1 and the Geostationary Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar proton events (SPEs) pose radiation hazards, disrupt technology, and impact operations on Earth and in space, making continuous monitoring essential. We compare 10-50 MeV proton flux measurements from SOHO/EPHIN at Lagrange Point 1 (L1) with those from NOAA/GOES in geostationary orbit (GEO) during Solar Cycle 23 and most of Cycle 24. We identify 83 &gt;=10 pfu SPEs observed at both locations and classify them into S1-S4 categories (comparable to NOAA's solar radiation storm scales). EPHIN detected earlier onsets and longer durations across all categories, along with earlier peaks and ends for S1-S3, while GOES recorded slightly earlier peak and end times for S4. S1 median timing offsets (EPHIN relative to GOES) were -20 +/- 50 min (onsets), -1.00 +/- 1.42 hr (peaks), and -1.08 +/- 2.21 hr (ends), with similar trends for S2-S3 and near-simultaneity for S4 (peaks ~ -0.17 +/- 1.62 hr; ends ~ +0.04 +/- 3.33 hr). Flux comparisons show that EPHIN measurements modestly exceed GOES for S1 (median ratios ~1.11 for peaks and ~1.06 for fluence) and are lower than GOES for stronger events (peaks ~0.97 +/- 0.29, 0.84 +/- 0.21; fluence ~0.84 +/- 0.16, 0.75 +/- 0.16 for S2-S3). The EPHIN-to-GOES peak flux and fluence ratios reach 0.16 +/- 0.03 and 0.29 +/- 0.07, respectively, for S4 events, originating from contamination of lower-energy GOES channels. Correlation analyses show no significant flux dependence on geomagnetic indices, field strength, or spacecraft position, suggesting minimal near-Earth modulation of &gt;=10 MeV proton access at GEO. These results highlight systematic differences in how SPEs manifest at L1 versus GEO and offer practical guidance for forecasting beyond Earth's magnetosphere, supporting mission planning for near-Earth and cislunar exploration, including Artemis.</description>

      <title>A multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06130v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel multi-phase thermo-mechanical rock-ice avalanche model. It considers rock, ice and fluid; includes rigorously derived ice melt rate, melting efficiency dependent fluid production rate and a general temperature equation. It explains advection-diffusion of heat including heat exchange across the avalanche, basal heat conduction, production and loss of heat due to frictional shearing and changing temperature, and temperature enhancement due to entrainment. Temperature equation couples rates of thermal conductivity and temperature. Ice melt intensity determines these rates as mixture conductivity evolves, characterizing thermo-mechanical processes. The model includes interfacial mass and momentum exchanges and mass and momentum productions due to entrainment. The latter significantly changes the state of temperature; yet, the former characterizes the rock-ice avalanche. Phase mass and momentum balances and temperature are coupled. New model offers the first-ever complete dynamical solution for rock-ice avalanche with changing temperature and ice melting. We develop an advection-diffusion-decay-source model and its analytical solutions providing novel understanding of temperature evolution. The 2021 Chamoli event simulations with r$.$avaflow (https://www.landslidemodels.org/r.avaflow/) illustrate the functionality of thermo-mechanical rock-ice avalanche model. Four scenarios are considered: variations in ice-melt-efficiency; fraction of ice; ice and rock frictions; governing the process of melting, flow transformation, spreading and mobility. Ice melting designates the motion and explains the rock-ice avalanche mobility: a phenomenal thermo-mechanical play. Essentially different controls of ice and rock frictions on the state of flow mobility are revealed, explaining complex thermo-mechanical processes. This provides a useful method for practitioners and engineers in solving problems associated with rock-ice avalanches.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale assessment for managing coastal geomorphic changes in southwestern Lake Michigan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding coastal geomorphic change is essential for advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a multi-scale coastal management framework. In particular, characterization of coastal geomorphic change across multiple spatial and temporal scales can provide essential insights and context-specific knowledge that can inform and empower local communities. In this study, we present a multi-scale assessment of coastal geomorphic change in southwestern Lake Michigan in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Three spatial scales: county, reach, and transect and two temporal scales: long-term and short-term were examined using nine sets of historical aerial imagery spanning 1937 to 2020. The site-averaged long-term (1937-2020) change rates for the bluff crest, bluff toe, and shoreline were -0.22, -0.17, and -0.16 m/year, respectively. In the short term (1995-2020), the corresponding rates were -0.22, -0.15, and -0.32 m/year, indicating an increasing shoreline erosion in recent years. The coastal geomorphic changes at county, reach, and transect scales were further characterized, showing regional and localized distributions of coastal erosion in our study sites. The mechanisms driving coastal change,particularly wave impacts, were also examined to assess their correlation with coastal geomorphic change across different spatial scales. The results indicate that wave impacts influence coastal environments at certain scales more strongly than at others. Several erosion "hotspots" were examined to identify local factors contributing to severe site-specific erosion. Lastly, the spatial uniformity of coastal geomorphology was examined between the county and reach scales. Overall, the findings suggest that multi-scale analyses provide a valuable insight for effective management of coastal geomorphology.</description>

      <title>Surface elevation errors in finite element Stokes models for glacier evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary data which determine the evolution of glaciation are the bedrock elevation and the surface mass balance. From this data, which we assume is defined over a fixed land region, the glacier's geometry solves a free boundary problem which balances the time derivative of the surface elevation, the surface velocity from the Stokes flow of the ice, and the surface balance rate. This problem can be posed in weak form as a variational inequality over a cone of admissible surface elevation functions, those which are above the bedrock topography. After some preparatory theory for the Stokes problem, we conjecture that the corresponding continuous-space, implicit time-step variational inequality problem is well-posed if the surface kinematical equation is appropriately regularized. This conjecture is supported by physical arguments and numerical evidence. We then prove a general theorem which bounds the numerical error made by finite element approximations of nonlinear-operator variational inequalities in Banach spaces. This bound is a sum of error terms of different types, special to variational inequalities. When it is applied to the implicit time-step glacier problem there are three terms in the bound: an error from discretizing the bed elevation, an error from numerically solving for the Stokes velocity, and finally an expected error which is quasi-optimal in the finite element space representation of the surface elevation. The design of glacier models is then reconsidered based on this a priori error analysis.</description>
