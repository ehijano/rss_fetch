      <title>Bragg diffraction of higher orders on oblique helicoidal liquid crystal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the oblique helicoidal structure of the chiral twist-bend nematic-forming mixture of CB7CB/CB6OCB/5CB doped by light-sensitive chiral compound based on azo-fragment, two consequent states of Bragg reflection of the light in the visible spectral range from 400 to 750 nm were experimentally observed in the course of decreasing the applied electric field. These states were assigned to different orders of Bragg's diffraction. While the second and third orders of Bragg's diffraction can be easily observed in conditions of standard electrooptic cell, the first order could be revealed only at very high electric field near the "red" edge of the visible spectral range. For the second and third orders of diffraction there is a narrow range of electric field where both diffraction orders are observed (so-called hybrid state), with transmittance spectra of the $Ch_{OH}$ structure showing two peaks at the short-wavelength and the long-wavelength edges of the visible spectral range. Model calculations of Bragg's reflection of light were carried out using literature values of elasticity constants and dielectric permittivity, and the calculated plots of the selective reflection maximum vs. voltage were in good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of neutral and charged microgel suspensions: from single-particle to collective behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations of an ensemble of realistic microgel particles in swollen conditions in a wide range of packing fractions $\zeta$. We compare neutral and charged microgels, where we consider charges distribution adherent to experimental conditions. Through a detailed analysis of single-particle behavior, we are able to identify the different regimes occurring upon increasing concentration: from shrinking to deformation and interpenetration, always connecting our findings to available experimental observations. We then link these single-particle features to the collective behavior of the suspension, finding evidence of a structural reentrance, that has no counterpart in the dynamics. Hence, while the maximum of the radial distribution function displays a non-monotonic behavior with increasing $\zeta$, the dynamics, quantified by the microgels' mean-squared displacement, always slows down. Key similarities and differences between neutral and charged microgels are identified. Importantly, at high enough $\zeta$ we also detect the fusion of the shells of charged microgels, that was previously invoked to explain key experimental findings. This highlights the fact that even for standard poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels, commonly considered as a prototype of soft colloid, charge effects are relevant. Overall, our study establishes a powerful framework to uncover the physics of microgel suspensions under several different conditions. Indeed, it can be readily extended to tackle different regimes, e.g. high temperature, and systems, e.g. complex microgel topologies such as ultra-low-crosslinked ones, where experimental evidence is still limited.</description>

      <title>Directed Aggregation of Cellulose Nanocrystals to Enhance Chiral Twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are bioderived nanoparticles that can be isolated from any source of natural cellulose via sulfuric acid hydrolysis. Arising from a combination of the negatively-charged sulfate half-ester groups grafted during this process and their elongated morphology, CNCs typically form colloidal cholesteric liquid crystalline phases in aqueous suspension. Recently, the chiral strength of such a CNC mesophase was correlated to the presence of CNCs with a 'bundle' morphology, analogous to the case of chiral dopants in molecular liquid crystal systems. This indicates the central role these composite particles play in the chiral behavior of CNCs, however the origin and formation pathway of the CNC bundles remains elusive. In this study, we systematically explore how different post-hydrolysis treatments alter the morphology of the CNCs (using electron microscopy, viscosimetry, and electron diffraction) and correlate this to changes in the observed liquid crystalline behavior. We found that the centrifugation step applied during CNC purification favors the formation of bundles of aligned crystallites, attached preferentially on their hydrophobic faces. This is in stark contrast to ionic treatments, where uncontrolled aggregation dominates. This reveals the importance of these often-disregarded purification steps on the final chiral and liquid crystalline properties of CNCs and promotes routes to tailor them towards a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Beaded metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the pragmatic to the symbolic, textiles play a prominent role in some of the most demanding yet ubiquitous scenarios, such as covering the complex and dynamic geometries of the human body. Textiles are made by repeated manipulations of slender fibers into structures with emergent properties. Today, these ancient metamaterials are being examined in a new light, propelled by the idea that their geometric structures can be leveraged to engineer functional soft materials. However, per their inherent softness, textiles and other compliant materials cannot typically withstand compressive forces.
  This limitation hinders the transfer of soft matter's rich shape-morphing capabilities to broader research areas that require load-bearing capabilities. Here we introduce \textit{beading} as a versatile platform that links centuries of human ingenuity encoded in the world of textiles with the current demand for smart, programmable materials. By incorporating discrete rigid units, i.e. \textit{beads}, into various fiber-based assemblies, beadwork adds tunable stiffness to otherwise flaccid fabrics, creating new opportunities for textiles to become load-bearing. We select a shell-like bead design as a model experimental system and thoroughly describe how its mechanics are captured by friction, the material properties of the constituent elements, and geometry. The fundamental characterization in this study demonstrates the range of complex behaviors possible with this class of material, inspiring the application of soft matter principles to fields that ultimately demand rigidity, such as robotics and architecture.</description>

      <title>Learning to control non-equilibrium dynamics using local imperfect gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard approaches to controlling dynamical systems involve biologically implausible steps such as backpropagation of errors or intermediate model-based system representations. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that "imperfect" feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative systems. For systems evolving under non-conservative dynamics, we derive a new theoretical result that makes possible the control of non-equilibrium steady-state probabilities through simple local update rules. Finally, we show that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>Mean-field model for a mixture of biaxial nematogens and dipolar nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a mean-field model for mixtures involving biaxial nematogens and dipolar nanoparticles, taking into account orientational and isotropic pair interactions between nematogens, but also orientational nematogen-nanoparticle interactions. We determine bulk equilibrium phase diagrams for a wide range of interaction strengths, identifying in each case the effect of the nanoparticles on the stability of nematic phases and on the appearance of multicritical points. Special attention is given to the limit of low concentration of nanoparticles, in which their effect on the temperatures of both the first-order uniaxial-isotropic and the continuous biaxial-uniaxial transitions is investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Collective deformation modes promote fibrous self-assembly in protein-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-assembly of particles into organized structures is a key feature of living organisms and a major engineering challenge. While it may proceed through the binding of perfectly matched, puzzle-pieces-like particles, many other instances involve ill-fitting particles that must deform to fit together. These include some pathological proteins, which have a known propensity to form fibrous aggregates. Despite this observation, the general relationship between the individual characteristics of the particles and the overall structure of the aggregate is not understood. To elucidate it, we analytically and numerically study the self-assembly of two-dimensional, deformable ill-fitting particles. We find that moderately sticky particles tend to form equilibrium self-limited aggregates whose size is set by an elastic boundary layer associated with collective deformations that may extend over many particles. Particles with a soft internal deformation mode thus give rise to large aggregates. Besides, when the particles are incompressible, their aggregates tend to be anisotropic and fiber-like. Our results are preserved in a more complex particle model with randomly chosen elastic properties. This indicates that generic protein characteristics such as allostery and incompressibility could favor the formation of fibers in protein aggregation, and suggests design principles for artificial self-assembling structures.</description>

      <title>Light-responsive active particles in a thermotropic liquid crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of synthetic microswimmers has advanced our understanding of the fundamental self-propelled mechanisms of living systems. However, there are scarce studies at the microscale within highly structured anisotropic media, such as bacteria or cellular receptors that swim in concentrated solutions of filamentous proteins or lipids with viscoelastic properties. Synthetic liquid crystals (LCs) have the potential to serve as biomimetic surrogates to study the structure and dynamics of living systems. Nevertheless, studies on thermotropic LCs have mainly focused on electro and magneto-phoretic effects, with a few others on diffusiophoresis or light-driven distortions of the LC nematic director. To the best of our knowledge, here we report self-thermophoretic experiments on thermotropic LCs for the first time. Our system consists of 2D confined Janus particles in 5CB with homeotropic anchoring on the particle and LC cell surfaces. The Janus particles include a conductive titanium coating that, upon exposure to an LED source, is heated and induces a local steady nematic-isotropic phase transition, leading to the self-propulsion of the particles orthogonally to the LC director. The trajectories of the Janus particles were tracked at different intensities of the applied light. A model is developed to describe the mean-squared displacement of a Janus particle suspended in a nematic LC. The model assumes that the Janus particle feels the LC as a continuum with the anisotropic viscosity of the bulk nematic phase. Moreover, the viscoelasticity of the LC is also considered. The model describes the experimental data well, and the fitting parameter related to the magnitude of the swimming force increases with the intensity of the applied light. Our approach suggests the possibility of utilizing Janus particles for microrheological measurements within nematic LCs.</description>

      <title>How motility drives the glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As wounds heal, embryos develop, cancer spreads, or asthma progresses, the cellular monolayer undergoes glass transition between solid-like jammed and fluid-like flowing states. During some of these processes, the cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT): they acquire in-plane polarity and become motile. Thus, how motility drives the glassy dynamics in epithelial systems is critical for the EMT process. However, no analytical framework that is indispensable for deeper insights exists. Here, we develop such a theory inspired by a well-known glass theory. One crucial result of this work is that the confluency affects the effective persistence time-scale of active force, described by its rotational diffusivity, $D_r^{\text{eff}}$. $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ differs from the bare rotational diffusivity, $D_r$, of the motile force due to cell shape dynamics, which acts to rectify the force dynamics: $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is equal to $D_r$ when $D_r$ is small and saturates when $D_r$ is large. We test the theoretical prediction of $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ and how it affects the relaxation dynamics in our simulations of active Vertex model. This novel effect of $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is crucial to understanding the new and previously published simulation data of active glassy dynamics in epithelial monolayers.</description>
