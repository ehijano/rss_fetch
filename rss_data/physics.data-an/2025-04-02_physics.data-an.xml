      <title>Tailor-Made Metasurface Camouflage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing electromagnetic scattering from an object has always been a task, inspiring efforts across disciplines such as materials science and electromagnetic theory. The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Near-instantaneous Atmospheric Retrievals and Model Comparison with FASTER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the dramatic improvement in the spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres demands a corresponding leap forward in our ability to analyze them: atmospheric retrievals need to be performed on thousands of spectra, applying to each large ensembles of models (that explore atmospheric chemistry, thermal profiles and cloud models) to identify the best one(s). In this limit, traditional Bayesian inference methods such as nested sampling become prohibitively expensive. We introduce FASTER (Fast Amortized Simulation-based Transiting Exoplanet Retrieval), a neural-network based method for performing atmospheric retrieval and Bayesian model comparison at a fraction of the computational cost of classical techniques. We demonstrate that the marginal posterior distributions of all parameters within a model as well as the posterior probabilities of the models we consider match those computed using nested sampling both on mock spectra, and for the real NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of WASP-39b. The true power of the FASTER framework comes from its amortized nature, which allows the trained networks to perform practically instantaneous Bayesian inference and model comparison over ensembles of spectra -- real or simulated -- at minimal additional computational cost. This offers valuable insight into the expected results of model comparison (e.g., distinguishing cloudy from cloud-free and isothermal from non-isothermal models), as well as their dependence on the underlying parameters, which is computationally unfeasible with nested sampling. This approach will constitute as large a leap in spectral analysis as the original retrieval methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo have proven to be.</description>
