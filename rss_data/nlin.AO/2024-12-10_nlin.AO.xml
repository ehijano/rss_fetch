      <title>Towards a Theory for the Formation of Chimera Patterns in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05504</link>

Abstract: Chimera states, marked by the coexistence of order and disorder in systems of coupled oscillators, have captivated researchers with their existence and intricate patterns. Despite ongoing advances, a fully understanding of the genesis of chimera states remains challenging. This work formalizes a systematic method by evoking pattern formation theory to explain the emergence of chimera states in complex networks, in a similar way to how Turing patterns are produced. Employing linear stability analysis and the spectral properties of complex networks, we show that the randomness of network topology, as reflected in the localization of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors, determines the emergence of chimera patterns, underscoring the critical role of network structure. In particular, this approach explains how amplitude and phase chimeras arise separately and explores whether phase chimeras can be chaotic or not. Our findings suggest that chimeras result from the interplay between local and global dynamics at different time scales. Validated through simulations and empirical network analyses, our method enriches the understanding of coupled oscillator dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Information Theory of Self-Organization Phenomena in Thermal Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper revisits Brownian motion from the perspective of Information Theory, aiming to explore the connections between Information Theory, Thermodynamics, and Complex Science. First, we propose a single-particle discrete Brownian motion model (SPBM). Within the framework of the maximum entropy principle and Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the equivalence of prior information and constraint conditions, revealing the relationship between local randomness and global probability distribution. By analyzing particle motion, we find that local constraints and randomness can lead to global probability distributions, thereby reflecting the interplay between local and global dynamics in the process of information transfer. Next, we extend our research to multi-particle systems, introducing the concepts of "Energy as Encoding" and "Information Temperature" to clarify how energy distribution determines information structure. We explore how energy, as not only a fundamental physical quantity in physical systems but also an inherently informational one, directly dictates the prior probability distribution of system states, thus serving as a form of information encoding. Based on this, we introduce the concept of "Equilibrium Flow" to explain the self-organizing behavior of systems under energy constraints and Negative Information Temperature. By proving three theorems regarding Equilibrium Flow systems, we reveal the criticality of Self-Organization, energy-information conversion efficiency, and the characteristic that event occurrence probabilities follow the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Through theoretical analysis and theorem proofs, we offer new perspectives for understanding the dynamics of Complex Systems, enriching the theoretical framework of Information Theory, Thermodynamics, and Complex Science, and providing a new theoretical basis for further research in related fields.</description>

      <title>Beating of eukaryotic flagella via Hopf bifurcation of a system of stalled molecular motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling of the beating of cilia and flagella in fluids is a particularly active field of study, given the biological relevance of these organelles. Various mathematical models have been proposed to represent the nonlinear dynamics of flagella, whose motion is powered by the work of molecular motors attached to filaments composing the axoneme. Here, we formulate and solve a nonlinear model of activation based on the sliding feedback mechanism, capturing the chemical and configurational changes of molecular motors driving axonemal motion. This multiscale model bridges microscopic motor dynamics with macroscopic flagellar motion, providing insight into the emergence of oscillatory beating. We validate the framework through linear stability analysis and fully nonlinear numerical simulations, showing the onset of spontaneous oscillations. To make the analysis more comprehensive, we compare our approach with two established sliding feedback models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Non-equilibrium Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) characterize critical changes in system behavior occurring at finite times, providing a lens to study nonequilibrium phenomena beyond conventional equilibrium physics. While extensively studied in quantum systems, DPTs have remained largely unexplored in classical settings. Recent experiments on complex systems, from social networks to financial markets, have revealed abrupt dynamical changes analogous to quantum DPTs, motivating the search for a theoretical understanding. Here, we present a minimal model for nonequilibrium networks, demonstrating that nonlinear interactions among network edges naturally give rise to DPTs. Specifically, we show that network degree diverges at a finite critical time, following a universal hyperbolic scaling, consistent with empirical observations. Our analytical results predict that key network properties, including degree distributions and clustering coefficients, exhibit critical scaling as criticality approaches. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for understanding emergent nonequilibrium criticality across diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>Metastability of multi-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Ott-Antonsen reduced $M$-population of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators is investigated, focusing on the influence of the phase-lag parameter $\alpha$ on the collective dynamics. For oscillator populations coupled on a ring, we obtained a wide variety of spatiotemporal patterns, including coherent states, traveling waves, partially synchronized states, modulated states, and incoherent states. Back-and-forth transitions between these states are found, which suggest metastability. Linear stability analysis reveals the stable regions of coherent states with different winding numbers $q$. Within certain $\alpha$ ranges, the system settles into stable traveling wave solutions despite the coherent states also being linearly stable. For around $\alpha \approx 0.46\pi$, the system displays the most frequent metastable transitions between coherent states and partially synchronized states, while for $\alpha$ closer to $\pi/2$, metastable transitions arise between partially synchronized states and modulated states. This model captures metastable dynamics akin to brain activity, offering insights into the synchronization of brain networks.</description>
