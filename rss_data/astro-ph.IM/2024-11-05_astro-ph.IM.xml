      <title>A highly efficient Voigt program for line profile computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluation of the Voigt function, a convolution of a Lorentzian and a Gaussian profile, is essential in various fields such as spectroscopy, atmospheric science, and astrophysics. Efficient computation of the function is crucial, especially in applications where the function may be called for an enormous number of times. In this paper, we present a highly efficient novel algorithm and its Fortran90 implementation for the practical evaluation of the Voigt function with accuracy in the order of 1.0e-6. The algorithm uses improved fits based on Chebyshev subinterval polynomial approximation for functions in two variables. The algorithm significantly outperforms widely-used competitive algorithms in the literature, in terms of computational speed, making it highly suitable for real-time applications and large-scale data processing tasks. The substantial improvement in efficiency positions the present algorithm and computer code as a valuable tool in relevant scientific domains. The algorithm has been adopted and implemented in the Meudon PDR code at Paris Observatory and is recommended for similar applications and simulation packages.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{bayes_spec}$: A Bayesian Spectral Line Modeling Framework for Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ is a Bayesian spectral line modeling framework for astrophysics. Given a user-defined model and a spectral line dataset, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ enables inference of the model parameters through different numerical techniques, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods, implemented in the PyMC probabilistic programming library. The API for $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ is designed to support astrophysical researchers who wish to ``fit'' arbitrary, user-defined models, such as simple spectral line profile models or complicated physical models that include a full physical treatment of radiative transfer. These models are ``cloud-based'', meaning that the spectral line data are decomposed into a series of discrete clouds with parameters defined by the user's model. Importantly, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ provides algorithms to determine the optimal number of clouds for a given model and dataset.</description>

      <title>Identifying Telescope Usage in Astrophysics Publications: A Machine Learning Framework for Institutional Research Management at Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large scientific institutions, such as the Space Telescope Science Institute, track the usage of their facilities to understand the needs of the research community. Astrophysicists incorporate facility usage data into their scientific publications, embedding this information in plain-text. Traditional automatic search queries prove unreliable for accurate tracking due to the misidentification of facility names in plain-text. As automatic search queries fail, researchers are required to manually classify publications for facility usage, which consumes valuable research time. In this work, we introduce a machine learning classification framework for the automatic identification of facility usage of observation sections in astrophysics publications. Our framework identifies sentences containing telescope mission keywords (e.g., Kepler and TESS) in each publication. Subsequently, the identified sentences are transformed using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and classified with a Support Vector Machine. The classification framework leverages the context surrounding the identified telescope mission keywords to provide relevant information to the classifier. The framework successfully classifies usage of MAST hosted missions with a 92.9% accuracy. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates robustness when compared to other approaches, considering common metrics and computational complexity. The framework's interpretability makes it adaptable for use across observatories and other scientific facilities worldwide.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Astronomical Time Series Model with Uncertainty Estimation for Detecting Misclassified Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a framework for estimating and evaluating uncertainty in deep-attention-based classifiers for light curves for variable stars. We implemented three techniques, Deep Ensembles (DEs), Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) and Hierarchical Stochastic Attention (HSA) and evaluated models trained on three astronomical surveys. Our results demonstrate that MCD and HSA offers a competitive and computationally less expensive alternative to DE, allowing the training of transformers with the ability to estimate uncertainties for large-scale light curve datasets. We conclude that the quality of the uncertainty estimation is evaluated using the ROC AUC metric.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ambient Radio Frequency Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio astronomy observatories, such as the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia, try to limit radio frequency interference to observe incredibly faint astronomical signals. These protective measures include placing observatories in geographically remote locations, the implementation of radio-frequency-interference-free quiet zones, or removal of interference in data processing. In 2018, we set out to explore how necessary radio-quiet zones are, by studying the radio frequency emission around the Observatory and around our local environment in Calgary, Alberta. We studied five well-used radio frequency bands and found the emission to be variable and environment dependent. While the radio frequency environment has changed since then, as a consequence of increased satellite activity and other forms of emission, we present these results as documentation of the past environment with the aim to redo the measurements. Overall, as there is use from both public and private services across the radio spectrum, protective measures at astronomical observatories are essential to reduce radio frequency interference.</description>

      <title>A sky survey of ultraviolet sources observed through AstroSat's UVIT: A point source catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard India's first dedicated multiwavelength satellite \textit{AstroSat} observed a significant fraction of the sky in the ultraviolet with a spatial resolution of 1.4\arcsec. We present a catalog of the point sources observed by UVIT in the far ultraviolet (FUV; 1300-1800 \AA) and near ultraviolet (NUV; 2000-3000 \AA). We carried out astrometry and photometry of 428 field pointings in the FUV and 54 field pointings in the NUV band, observed in 5 filter bands in each channel respectively, covering an area of about 63 square degrees. The final catalog contains about 102,773 sources. The limiting magnitude(AB) of the F148W band filter, that has the largest number of detections is $\sim21.3$. For the NUV channel, we find the limiting magnitude at around $\sim23$. We describe the final catalog and present the results of the statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the clock of JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST, despite not being designed to observe astrophysical phenomena that vary on rapid time scales, can be an unparalleled tool for such studies. If timing systematics can be controlled, JWST will be able to open up the sub-second infrared timescale regime. Rapid time-domain studies, such as lag measurements in accreting compact objects and Solar System stellar occultations, require both precise inter-frame timing and knowing when a time series begins to an absolute accuracy significantly below 1s. In this work we present two long-duration observations of the deeply eclipsing double white dwarf system ZTF J153932.16+502738.8, which we use as a natural timing calibrator to measure the absolute timing accuracy of JWST's clock. From our two epochs, we measure an average clock accuracy of $0.12\pm0.06$s, implying that JWST can be used for sub-second time-resolution studies down to the $\sim100$ms level, a factor $\sim5$ improvement upon the pre-launch clock accuracy requirement. We also find an asymmetric eclipse profile in the F322W2 band, which we suggest has a physical origin.</description>

      <title>La Serena School for Data Science and the Spanish Virtual Observatory Schools: Initiatives Based on Hands on Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The worlds of Data Science (including big and/or federated data, machine learning, etc) and Astrophysics started merging almost two decades ago. For instance, around 2005, international initiatives such as the Virtual Observatory framework rose to standardize the way we publish and transfer data, enabling new tools such as VOSA (SED Virtual Observatory Analyzer) to come to existence and remain relevant today. More recently, new facilities like the Vera Rubin Observatory, serve as motivation to develop efficient and extremely fast (very often deep learning based) methodologies in order to fully exploit the informational content of the vast Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) dataset. However, fundamental changes in the way we explore and analyze data cannot permeate in the "astrophysical sociology and idiosyncrasy" without adequate training. In this talk, I will focus on one specific initiative that has been extremely successful and is based on "learning by doing": the La Serena School for Data Science. I will also briefly touch on a different successful approach: a series of schools organized by the Spanish Virtual Observatory. The common denominator among the two kinds of schools is to present the students with real scientific problems that benefit from the concepts / methodologies taught. On the other hand, the demographics targeted by both initiatives vary significantly and can represent examples of two "flavours" to be followed by others.</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian regression in astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model mis-specification (e.g. the presence of outliers) is commonly encountered in astronomical analyses, often requiring the use of ad hoc algorithms (e.g. sigma-clipping). We develop and implement a generic Bayesian approach to linear regression, based on Student's t-distributions, that is robust to outliers and mis-specification of the noise model. Our method is validated using simulated datasets with various degrees of model mis-specification; the derived constraints are shown to be systematically less biased than those from a similar model using normal distributions. We demonstrate that, for a dataset without outliers, a worst-case inference using t-distributions would give unbiased results with $\lesssim\!10$ per cent increase in the reported parameter uncertainties. We also compare with existing analyses of real-world datasets, finding qualitatively different results where normal distributions have been used and agreement where more robust methods have been applied. A Python implementation of this model, t-cup, is made available for others to use.</description>

      <title>Astronomical outreach and education in marginalised and indigenous communities: astronomy as a tool for social development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The way we look at the sky is connected to the cosmological paradigm embraced by the society we live in. On the other hand, several astronomical concepts reinforce the idea of a common humanity. Yet, scientific outreach is frequenty reaching out only to a specific part of the world population, often excluding people living in extreme social vulnerability, victims of violence and prejudice, fighting for their lives and for the right of living according to their traditions. We present two outreach projects, developed in Brazil, funded by the Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), i.e. 'Under Other Skies' and 'OruMbya', which tackle the importance of ethno-astronomy, and the collaboration with leaders and cultural agents of marginalised communities. We also describe an educational project born in the favela of Cantagalo Pav\~ao Pava\~azinho (PPG), in Rio de Janeiro, during the COVID19 pandemic, which started a collaboration with local educators and artists to offer classes of astronomy and English language to children in the favela</description>

      <title>Light Scattering Measurements of KCl Particles as an Exoplanet Cloud Analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Salt clouds are predicted to be common on warm exoplanets, but their optical properties are uncertain. The Exoplanet Cloud Ensemble Scattering System (ExCESS), a new apparatus to measure the scattering intensity and degree of linear polarization (DOLP) for an ensemble of particles, is introduced here and used to study the light scattering properties of KCl cloud analogs. ExCESS illuminates particles with a polarized laser beam (532 nm) and uses a photomultiplier tube detector to sweep the plane of illumination. Scattering measurements for KCl particles were collected for three size distributions representative of modeled clouds for the warm exoplanet GJ 1214b. Our measurements show that Lorenz-Mie calculations, commonly used to estimate the light scattering properties of assumedly spherical cloud particles, offer an inaccurate depiction of cubic and cuboid shaped KCl particles. All of our measurements indicate that Lorenz-Mie scattering overestimates the backscattering intensity of our cloud analogs and incorrectly predicts the scattering at mid-phase angles (~90 degrees) and preferential polarization state of KCl scattered light. Our results align with the general scattering properties of non-spherical particles and underscore the importance of further understanding the effects that such particles will have on radiative transfer models of exoplanet atmospheres and reflected light observations of exoplanets by the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Re-thinking Richardson-Lucy without Iteration Cutoffs: Physically Motivated Bayesian Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Richardson-Lucy deconvolution is widely used to restore images from degradation caused by the broadening effects of a point spread function and corruption by photon shot noise, in order to recover an underlying object. In practice, this is achieved by iteratively maximizing a Poisson emission likelihood. However, the RL algorithm is known to prefer sparse solutions and overfit noise, leading to high-frequency artifacts. The structure of these artifacts is sensitive to the number of RL iterations, and this parameter is typically hand-tuned to achieve reasonable perceptual quality of the inferred object. Overfitting can be mitigated by introducing tunable regularizers or other ad hoc iteration cutoffs in the optimization as otherwise incorporating fully realistic models can introduce computational bottlenecks. To resolve these problems, we present Bayesian deconvolution, a rigorous deconvolution framework that combines a physically accurate image formation model avoiding the challenges inherent to the RL approach. Our approach achieves deconvolution while satisfying the following desiderata:
  I deconvolution is performed in the spatial domain (as opposed to the frequency domain) where all known noise sources are accurately modeled and integrated in the spirit of providing full probability distributions over the density of the putative object recovered;
  II the probability distribution is estimated without making assumptions on the sparsity or continuity of the underlying object;
  III unsupervised inference is performed and converges to a stable solution with no user-dependent parameter tuning or iteration cutoff;
  IV deconvolution produces strictly positive solutions; and
  V implementation is amenable to fast, parallelizable computation.</description>

      <title>Fabry-P\'{e}rot open resonant cavities for measuring the dielectric parameters of mm-wave optical materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave cosmology experiments refine their optical chains, precisely characterizing their optical materials under cryogenic conditions becomes increasingly important. For instance, as the aperture sizes and bandwidths of millimeter-wave receivers increase, the design of antireflection coatings becomes progressively more constrained by an accurate measure of material optical properties in order to achieve forecasted performance. Likewise, understanding dielectric and scattering losses is relevant to photon noise modeling in presently-deploying receivers such as BICEP Array and especially to future experiments such as CMB-S4. Additionally, the design of refractive elements such as lenses necessitates an accurate measure of the refractive index. High quality factor Fabry-P\'{e}rot open resonant cavities provide an elegant means for measuring these optical properties. Employing a hemispherical resonator that is compatible with a quick-turnaround 4 Kelvin cryostat, we can measure the dielectric and scattering losses of low-loss materials at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures. We review the design, characterization, and metrological applications of quasioptical cavities commissioned for measuring the dielectric materials in the BICEP3 (95 GHz) and BICEP Array mid-frequency (150 GHz) optics. We also discuss the efforts to improve the finesse of said cavities, for better resolution of degenerate higher order modes, which can provide stronger constraints on cavity parameters and sample material thickness.</description>

Abstract: We present the characterization of cosmogenic muon backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), located in the Edgar Experimental Mine (EEM) in Idaho Springs, Colorado. The CURIE facility at the EEM offers a versatile shallow underground environment, with accessible horizontal tunnel access and stable rock formations ideal for low-background physics experiments. We have measured the total underground muon flux in two locations, Site 0 and Site 1, yielding values of $\phi$ = 0.246 $\pm$ 0.020$_{sys.}$ $\pm$ 0.012$_{stat.}$ and 0.239 $\pm$ 0.025$_{sys.}$ $\pm$ 0.010$_{stat.}$ $\mu\text{/}m^{2}\text{/}s$, respectively. We have utilized GEANT4 and PROPOSAL Monte Carlo simulations with Daemonflux and MUTE to model the muon flux at both sites, as well as an additional future location. We find good agreement between measurement and simulations, demonstrating the first instance of this computational framework being successfully used for depths $&lt;$ 1 km.w.e. The measured underground flux corresponds to a factor of 700 reduction compared to the sea level flux. Additionally, we present a new depth-intensity relationship to normalize the mountain overburden to an equivalent flat depth, enabling direct comparison with other underground facilities. We report an average equivalent vertical depth of 0.415 $\pm$ 0.027 km.w.e. Based on our measurements, this work highlights the facility's capability for hosting low-background experiments, addressing the demand for shallow underground research spaces.</description>

      <title>Askaryan Radio Array: searching for the highest energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for ultra-high energy ($E_\nu \geq 10$ PeV) cosmogenic and astrophysical neutrinos (UHENs) have been conducted by several experiments over the last two decades. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), located near the geographical South Pole, was one of the first two experiments that used radio antennas sensitive to orthogonal polarizations for detection of neutrino-induced Askaryan radiation. ARA comprises five independent autonomous stations, with an additional low threshold phased array merged with station 5, which were deployed at a depth of 100-200 m over the period 2012-2018, corresponding to a total livetime of more than 27 station years. In this article, we present a brief overview of the detector, its detection technique, and discuss a few of its major achievements with a focus on the current status of the array-wide UHEN search. We expect to produce the most sensitive results on the neutrino flux by any existing in-ice neutrino experiment below 1000 EeV energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments conducted since 2018, using three geographically spaced synchronized radio telescopes, and a radio interferometer, indicate the presence of anomalous narrow bandwidth pulse pairs, conjectured to be sourced from a celestial direction near the star Rigel. Many explanatory hypotheses are possible. In the current work, a measurement method is proposed and implemented to attempt to provide high levels of statistical power of narrowband pulse pair observations, while minimizing interferometer instrument adjustments that might bias the experiment. Using the proposed method, twenty pulse pairs having statistical power at 5 to 10 standard deviations, and one pulse pair at 22 standard deviations of mean shift of pulse pair count, were observed in the prior celestial direction range, while using other celestial directions as an experimental comparison group. High levels of standard deviations of pulse pair count mean shift, observed in this 92 day experiment, imply the falsification of a Gaussian noise hypothesis. Alternate and auxiliary hypotheses, and further experiments, are sought to try to explain the narrow bandwidth pulsed signals.</description>

      <title>Hints of spin-magnitude correlations and a rapidly spinning subpopulation of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex astrophysical processes leading to the formation of binary black holes and their eventual merger are imprinted on the spins of the individual black holes. We revisit the astrophysical distribution of those spins based on gravitational waves from the third gravitational wave transient catalog GWTC-3, (Abbott et al. 2023a), looking for structure in the two-dimensional space defined by the dimensionless spin magnitudes of the heavier ($\chi_1$) and lighter ($\chi_2$) component black holes. We find support for two distinct subpopulations with greater than $95\%$ credibility. The dominant population is made up of black holes with small spins, preferring $\chi_1 \approx 0.2$ for the primary and $\chi_2 \approx 0$ for the secondary; we report signs of an anticorrelation between $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, as well as as evidence against a subpopulation of binaries in which both components are nonspinning. The subdominant population consists of systems in which both black holes have relatively high spins and contains $20^{+18}_{-18}\%$ of the binaries. The binaries that are most likely to belong in this subpopulation are massive and slightly more likely to have spin-orientations aligned with the orbital angular momentum--potentially consistent with isolated binary formation channels capable of producing large spins, like chemically homogeneous evolution. This hint of a rapidly spinning subpopulation hinges on GW190517, a binary with large and well-measured spins. Our results, which are enabled by novel hierarchical inference methods, represent a first step towards more descriptive population models for black hole spins, and will be strengthened or refuted by the large number of gravitational wave detections expected in the next several years.</description>

      <title>Detecting unresolved lensed SNe Ia in LSST using blended light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe) are promising probes for providing absolute distance measurements using gravitational-lens time delays. Spatially unresolved LSNe offer an opportunity to enhance the sample size for precision cosmology. We predict that there will be approximately three times as many unresolved as resolved LSNe Ia in the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the {\it Rubin} Observatory. In this article, we explore the feasibility of detecting unresolved LSNe Ia from a pool of preclassified SNe Ia light curves using the shape of the blended light curves with deep-learning techniques. We find that $\sim 30\%$ unresolved LSNe Ia can be detected with a simple 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) using well-sampled $rizy$-band light curves (with a false-positive rate of $\sim 3\%$). Even when the light curve is well observed in only a single band among $r$, $i$, and $z$, detection is still possible with false-positive rates ranging from $\sim 4$ to $7\%$ depending on the band. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these unresolved cases can be detected at an early stage using light curves up to $\sim20$ days from the first observation with well-controlled false-positive rates, providing ample opportunity to trigger follow-up observations. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of time-delay estimations using solely LSST-like data of unresolved light curves, particularly for doubles, when excluding systems with low time delays and magnification ratios. However, the abundance of such systems among those unresolved in LSST poses a significant challenge. This approach holds potential utility for upcoming wide-field surveys, and overall results could significantly improve with enhanced cadence and depth in the future surveys.</description>

      <title>StarDICE III: Characterization of the photometric instrument with a Collimated Beam Projector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of type Ia supernovae magnitudes provides cosmological distances, which can be used to constrain dark energy parameters. Large photometric surveys require a substantial improvement in the calibration precision of their photometry to reduce systematic uncertainties in cosmological constraints. The StarDICE experiment is designed to establish accurate broadband flux references for these surveys, aiming for sub-percent precision in magnitude measurements. This requires a precise measurement of the filter bandpasses of both the StarDICE and survey instruments with sub-nanometer accuracy. To that end, we have developed the Collimated Beam Projector (CBP), an optical device capable of calibrating the throughput of an astronomical telescope and of its filters. The CBP is built from a tunable laser source and a reversed telescope to emit a parallel monochromatic light beam that is continuously monitored in flux and wavelength. The CBP output light flux is measured using a large area photodiode, previously calibrated relative to a NIST photodiode. We derive the StarDICE telescope throughput and filter transmissions from the CBP measurements, anchoring it to the absolute calibration provided by the NIST. After analyzing the systematic uncertainties, we achieved sub-nanometer accuracy in determining filter central wavelengths, measured each filter transmission with a precision of 0.5% per 1nm bin, and detected out-of-band leakages at 0.01%. Furthermore, we have synthesized the equivalent transmission for full pupil illumination from four sample positions in the StarDICE telescope mirror, with an accuracy of approximately 0.2nm for central wavelengths and 7mmag for broadband fluxes. We demonstrated our ability to characterize a telescope throughput down to the mmag, and paved the way for future developments, such as a portable CBP version for in-situ transmission monitoring.</description>

      <title>Generating synthetic star catalogs from simulated data for next-gen observatories with py-ananke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find ourselves on the brink of an exciting era in observational astrophysics, driven by groundbreaking facilities like JWST, Euclid, Rubin, Roman, SKA, or ELT. Simultaneously, computational astrophysics has shown significant strides, yielding highly realistic galaxy formation simulations, thanks to both hardware and software enhancements. Bridging the gap between simulations and observations has become paramount for meaningful comparisons. We introduce py-ananke, a Python pipeline designed to generate synthetic resolved stellar surveys from cosmological simulations, adaptable to various instruments. Building upon its predecessor, ananke by Sanderson et al. 2020 (arXiv:1806.10564), which produced Gaia DR2 mock star surveys, the py-ananke package offers a user-friendly "plug &amp; play" experience. The pipeline employs cutting-edge phase-space density estimation and initial mass function sampling to convert particle data into synthetic stars, while interpolating pre-computed stellar isochrone tracks for photometry. Additionally, it includes modules for estimating interstellar reddening, dust-induced extinctions, and for quantifying errors through dedicated modeling approaches. py-ananke promises to serve as a vital bridge between computational astrophysics and observational astronomy, facilitating preparations and making scientific predictions for the next generation of telescopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After black holes collide, the remnant settles to a stationary state by emitting gravitational waves. Once non-linearities subside, these ringdown waves are dominated by exponentially-damped sinusoids, or quasinormal modes. We develop a general method using perturbative spectral expansions to calculate the quasinormal-mode frequencies and damping times in a wide class of modified gravity theories for black holes with any subextremal spin. We apply this method to scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to show its accuracy, thus enabling robust ringdown tests with gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time transformation between the geocentric, solar system barycentric, and luni-centric coordinate reference systems requires relativistic corrections to account for differences in gravitational potential and relative motion. To maintain consistency with Terrestrial Time (TT), solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) on average must exhibit no rate difference from TT. Although the IAU has established resolutions for transformations involving TT and TDB, the analogous transformation between TDB and a lunar surface time scale (TL) is essential, especially with upcoming robotic and crewed lunar missions. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, at the rate of 56.0256 us/d, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system and lunar ephemerides.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 3D Planetary Atmosphere Simulations with a Surrogate Radiative Transfer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to enhancing the computational efficiency of 3D atmospheric simulations by integrating a machine-learned surrogate model into the OASIS global circulation model (GCM). Traditional GCMs, which are based on repeatedly numerically integrating physical equations governing atmospheric processes across a series of time-steps, are time-intensive, leading to compromises in spatial and temporal resolution of simulations. This research improves upon this limitation, enabling higher resolution simulations within practical timeframes. Speeding up 3D simulations holds significant implications in multiple domains. Firstly, it facilitates the integration of 3D models into exoplanet inference pipelines, allowing for robust characterisation of exoplanets from a previously unseen wealth of data anticipated from JWST and post-JWST instruments. Secondly, acceleration of 3D models will enable higher resolution atmospheric simulations of Earth and Solar System planets, enabling more detailed insights into their atmospheric physics and chemistry. Our method replaces the radiative transfer module in OASIS with a recurrent neural network-based model trained on simulation inputs and outputs. Radiative transfer is typically one of the slowest components of a GCM, thus providing the largest scope for overall model speed-up. The surrogate model was trained and tested on the specific test case of the Venusian atmosphere, to benchmark the utility of this approach in the case of non-terrestrial atmospheres. This approach yields promising results, with the surrogate-integrated GCM demonstrating above 99.0% accuracy and 147 factor GPU speed-up of the entire simulation compared to using the matched original GCM under Venus-like conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativistic radiative transfer calculations are essential for comparing theoretical models of black hole accretion flows and jets with observational data. In this work, we introduce Coport, a novel public code specifically designed for covariant polarized ray-tracing radiative transfer computations in any spacetime. Written in Julia, Coport includes an interface for visualizing numerical results obtained from HARM, a publicly available implementation of the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code. We validate the precision of our code by comparing its outputs with the results from a variety of established methodologies. This includes the verification against analytical solutions, the validation through thin-disk assessments, and the evaluation via thick-disk analyses. Notably, our code employs a methodology that eliminates the need for separating the computations of spacetime propagation and plasma propagation. Instead, it directly solves the coupled, covariant, polarized radiative transfer equation in curved spacetime, seamlessly integrating the effects of gravity with plasma influences. This approach sets our code apart from the existing alternatives and enhances its accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Next-generation global gravitational-wave detector network: Impact of detector orientation on compact binary coalescence and stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>TV Mon -- post mass transfer Algol type binary with $\delta$ Scuti pulsations in primary component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the detached eclipsing binary TV~Mon using spectra from the LAMOST medium-resolution survey and ASAS-SN, CoRoT photometry. We apply multiple-epochs spectral fitting to derive RV and spectral parameters. The analysis of eclipses in CoRoT data show the relative sizes of the stellar components and almost edge-on circular orbit. Combining the spectral and photometrical solutions we estimate masses and radii of the components: $M_{A,B}=2.063\pm0.033({\rm stat.})\pm0.095({\rm syst.}),~0.218\pm0.004({\rm stat.})\pm0.018({\rm syst.})~M_\odot$, $R_{A,B}=2.394\pm0.014,~2.860\pm0.016~R_\odot$. SED analysis and Gaia parallax allow us to get estimation of temperatures ${T_{ eff}}_{A,B}=7624^{+194}_{-174},~5184^{+130}_{-123}$ K and distance $d=907\pm11$ pc. We identify three $\delta$ Scuti type pulsation frequencies in the primary component, while we also suspect TV~Mon having a spot activity in the secondary component. This system experienced intensive mass transfer and mass ratio reversal in the past, but currently shows no signs of mass transfer in the spectra. The low mass component will lose its outer envelope and shrink to the helium white dwarf, the mass and orbital period of which are in good agreement with evolutionary models predictions.</description>

      <title>Forecasting High-Speed Solar Wind Streams from Solar Images</title>

Abstract: The solar wind, a stream of charged particles originating from the Sun and transcending interplanetary space, poses risks to technology and astronauts.In this work, we develop a prediction model to forecast the solar wind speed at the Earth. We focuse on high-speed streams (HSSs) and their solar source regions, coronal holes. As input, we use the coronal hole area, extracted from solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images and mapped on a fixed grid, as well as the solar wind speed 27 days before. We use a polynomial regression model and a distribution transformation to predict the solar wind speed with a lead time of four days. Our forecast achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 68.1 km/s for the solar wind speed prediction and an RMSE of 76.8 km/s for the HSS peak velocity prediction for 2010 to 2019. We also demonstrate the applicability of our model to the current solar cycle 25 in an operational setting, resulting in an RMSE of 80.3 km/s and an HSS peak velocity RMSE of 92.2 km/s. The study shows that a small number of physical features explains most of the solar wind variation, and that focusing on these features with simple machine learning algorithms even outperforms current approaches based on deep neural networks and MHD simulations. In addition, we explain why the typically used loss function, the mean squared error, systematically underestimates the HSS peak velocities, aggravates operational space weather forecasts, and how a distribution transformation can resolve this issue.</description>

      <title>Joint Modeling of Quasar Variability and Accretion Disk Reprocessing using Latent Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasars are bright active galactic nuclei powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. Their stochastic brightness variability depends on the physical properties of the accretion disk and black hole. The upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to observe tens of millions of quasars, so there is a need for efficient techniques like machine learning that can handle the large volume of data. Quasar variability is believed to be driven by an X-ray corona, which is reprocessed by the accretion disk and emitted as UV/optical variability. We are the first to introduce an auto-differentiable simulation of the accretion disk and reprocessing. We use the simulation as a direct component of our neural network to jointly model the driving variability and reprocessing to fit simulated LSST 10-year quasar light curves. The driving variability is reconstructed using a latent stochastic differential equation, a physically motivated, generative deep learning method that can model continuous-time stochastic dynamics. By embedding these physical processes into our network, we achieve a model that is more robust and interpretable. We also use transformers to scale our model to tens of millions of parameters. We demonstrate how our model outperforms a Gaussian process regression baseline and can infer accretion disk parameters and time delays between wavebands, even for out-of-distribution driving signals. Our approach provides a powerful and scalable framework that can be adapted to solve other inverse problems in multivariate time series with irregular sampling.</description>

      <title>First Detection of Molecular Gas in the Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxy Malin 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After over three decades of unsuccessful attempts, we report the first detection of molecular gas emission in Malin 1, the largest spiral galaxy observed to date, and one of the most iconic giant low surface brightness galaxies. Using ALMA, we detect significant $^{12}$CO(J=1-0) emission in the galaxy's central region and tentatively identify CO emission across three regions on the disc. These observations allow for a better estimate of the H$_2$ mass and molecular gas mass surface density, both of which are remarkably low given the galaxy's scale. By integrating data on its HI mass, we derive a very low molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio. Overall, our results highlight the minimal presence of molecular gas in Malin 1, contrasting sharply with its extensive, homogeneous atomic gas reservoir. For the first time, we position Malin 1 on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) diagram, where it falls below the main sequence for normal spirals, consistent with previous upper limits but now with more accurate figures. These findings are crucial for constraining our understanding of star formation processes in environments characterized by extremely low molecular gas densities and for refining models of galaxy formation, thereby improving predictions concerning the formation, evolution, and distribution of these giant, elusive galaxies.</description>
