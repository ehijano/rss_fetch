      <title>Closed graph property and Khalimsky spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the following text for Khalimsky $n-$dimensional space $\mathcal{K}^n$ we show self--map $f:\mathcal{K}^n\to\mathcal{K}^n$ has closed graph if and only if there exist integers $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$ such that $f$ is a constant map with value $(2\lambda_1,\cdots,2\lambda_n)$. We also show each self--map on Khalimsky circle and Khalimsky sphere which has closed graph is a constant map. The text is motivated by examples.</description>

      <title>On quasisymmetric mappings between ultrametric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1980 P. Tukia and J. V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} in seminal paper [P. Tukia and J. V\"ais\"al\"a, Quasisymmetric embeddings of metric spaces, Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn., Ser. A I, Math. 5, 97--114 (1980)] extended a concept of quasisymmetric mapping known from the theory of quasiconformal mappings to the case of general metric spaces. They also found an estimation for the ratio of diameters of two subsets which are images of two bounded subsets of a metric space under a quasisymmetric mapping. We improve this estimation for the case of ultrametric spaces. It was also shown that the image of an ultrametric space under an $\eta$-quasisymmetric mapping with $\eta(1)=1$ is again an ultrametric space. In the case of finite ultrametric spaces it is proved that such mappings are ball-preserving.</description>

      <title>Expensive Homeomorphism of Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the longstanding question of whether expansive homeomorphisms can exist within convex bodies in Euclidean spaces. Utilizing fundamental tools from topology, including the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, we establish the nonexistence of such mappings. Through an inductive approach based on dimension and the extension of boundary homeomorphisms, we demonstrate that expansive homeomorphisms are incompatible with the compact and convex structure of these bodies. This work highlights the interplay between topological principles and metric geometry, offering new insights into the constraints imposed by convexity.</description>

      <title>Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I propose a mathematical framework for embedding an unshaped discrete lattice $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$. This framework simplifies complex concepts in pure mathematics and physics by connecting discrete lattice structures with continuous geometric interpretations through practical embeddings.</description>

      <title>Indefinite Descriptive Proximities Inherent in Dynamical Systems. An Axiomatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces indefinite proximities inherent in the collection of physical objects found in a dynamical system. Axiomatically, these indefinite proximities lead to a new form of Hausdorff topology, which is indefinite descriptively. The main results in this paper are (1) Every descriptive proximity space on a dynamical system is indefinite (Theorem 1), (2) Every dynamical system has an indefinite descriptive Hausdorff topology (Theorem 3), and (3) The energy of a dynamical system varies with every clock tick (Theorem 4). An application of these results is given in terms of the detection of those portions of a dynamical system that are stable and that have low energy dissipation.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a determinstic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave determinstic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, with partially identical shapes and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>
