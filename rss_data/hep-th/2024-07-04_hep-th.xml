      <title>Localization of the free energy in supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general formula for the gravitational free energy of Euclidean supersymmetric solutions to $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity coupled to vector multiplet matter. This allows one to compute the free energy without solving any supergravity equations, just assuming the solutions exist. As well as recovering some known results in the literature with ease, we also present new supergravity results that match with holographically dual field theory computations.</description>

      <title>Orientifold Calabi-Yau Threefolds: Divisor Exchanges and Multi-Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Kreuzer-Skarke database of 4-dimensional reflexive polytopes, we systematically constructed a new database of orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds with $h^{1,1}(X) \leq 12$. Our approach involved non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ involutions, incorporating both divisor exchanges and multi-divisor reflections acting on the Calabi-Yau threefolds. Each proper involution results in an orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds and we constructed 320,386,067 such examples. We developed a novel algorithm that significantly reduces the complexity of determining all the fixed loci under the involutions, and clarifies the types of O-planes. Our results show that under proper involutions, the majority of cases end up with O3/O7-plane systems, and most of these further admit a naive Type IIB string vacua. Additionally, a new type of free action was determined. We also computed the smoothness and the splitting of Hodge numbers in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold limit for these orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Dualities of Self-Dual Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any causal nonlinear electrodynamics theory that is "self-dual" (electromagnetic $U(1)$-duality invariant), the Legendre-dual pair of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities $\{\mathcal{L},\mathcal{H}\}$ are constructed from functions $\{\ell,h\}$ on ${\bf R}^+$ related to a particle-mechanics Lagrangian and Hamiltonian. We show how a `duality' relating $\ell$ to $h$ implies that $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ are related by a simple map between appropriate pairs of variables. We also discuss Born's "Legendre self-duality" and implications of a new "$\Phi$-parity" duality. Our results are illustrated with many examples.</description>

      <title>Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity as a Noncritical String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jackiw Teitelboim (JT) gravity has proven to be an excellent tool for investigating aspects of quantum gravity and black hole physics. In recent years, the study of JT gravity and its deformations has helped us learn about the different contributions of geometries in the gravitational path integral, the quantum gravity Hilbert space, the space-time factorization problem, the role of averaging in holography, the black hole information paradox, and the matrix models. All this motivates the exploration of the JT gravity in different setups, with and without matter. Here, we consider JT gravity conformally coupled to Liouville field theory and matter fields. This model admits to be interpreted as a non-critical string theory on a linear dilaton background with a tachyonic Liouville potential along a null direction. The constant curvature constraint of JT gravity results in a neutralization of the Liouville mode, which makes it possible to compute the four-point correlation function of the theory analytically. Here we give the explicit derivation of the four-point function and briefly comment on its properties, such as monodromy invariance, crossing symmetry, factorization, and limits.</description>

      <title>3d Gravity as a random ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give further evidence that the matrix-tensor model studied in \cite{belin2023} is dual to AdS$_{3}$ gravity including the sum over topologies. This provides a 3D version of the duality between JT gravity and an ensemble of random Hamiltonians, in which the matrix and tensor provide random CFT$_2$ data subject to a potential that incorporates the bootstrap constraints. We show how the Feynman rules of the ensemble produce a sum over all three-manifolds and how surgery is implemented by the matrix integral. The partition functions of the resulting 3d gravity theory agree with Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) on a fixed, hyperbolic manifold. However, on non-hyperbolic geometries, our 3d gravity theory differs from VTQFT, leading to a difference in the eigenvalue statistics of the associated ensemble. As explained in \cite{belin2023}, the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the matrix-tensor integral play a crucial role in understanding how gravity emerges in the limit that the ensemble localizes to exact CFT's. We show how the SD equations can be translated into a combinatorial problem about three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Topics in Weyl Geometry and Quantum Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first part of this thesis focuses on the Weyl-covariant nature of holography. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham (FG) ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the ALAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory (QFT). The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly.
  The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.</description>

      <title>On Measuring Distances in the Quantum Gravity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a generalized notion of distance between vacua in the theory of a scalar field $\phi$ with scalar potential $V(\phi)$ coupled to gravity. We propose the normalized tension of the domain wall connecting different field values, with a varying normalization relative to a local energy scale, as the distance. We show this definition reproduces the usual moduli space distance for zero potential, as well as the $d\propto |\log \Lambda|$ behavior with the vacuum energy $-\Lambda$ in the AdS case, previously proposed in the literature. In the case of large AdS we also obtain the expected exponent of mass versus distance in one particular case, when the mass of the light tower is $m\sim \sqrt \Lambda$ and there is a single extra dimension decompactifying. We also discuss the features and shortcomings of alternative but related proposals.</description>

      <title>Modular properties of massive scalar partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the exact thermal partition functions of a massive scalar field on flat spacetime backgrounds of the form $\mathbb R^{d-q}\times \mathbb T^{q+1}$ and show that they possess an ${\rm SL}(q+1,\mathbb Z)$ symmetry. Non-trivial relations between equivalent expressions for the result are obtained by doing the computation using functional, canonical and worldline methods. For $q=1$, the results exhibit modular symmetry and may be expressed in terms of massive Maass-Jacobi forms. In the complex case with chemical potential for ${\rm U}(1)$ charge turned on, the usual discussion of relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation is modified by the presence of the small dimensions.</description>

      <title>Probing Krylov Complexity in Scalar Field Theory with General Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krylov complexity characterizes the operator growth in quantum many-body systems or in quantum field theories. The existing literatures have studied the Krylov complexity in the low temperature limit in quantum field theory. In this paper, we extend and systematically study the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy in a scalar field theory with general temperatures. To this end, we propose a new method to calculate the Wightman power spectrum which allows us to compute the Lanczos coefficients and then to study the Krylov complexity (entropy) extensively. Compared to the previous studies in the low temperature limit, we find that the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity (entropy) in the high temperature limit will behave somewhat differently. Finally, we also discuss the Krylov complexity (entropy) in the symmetry breaking phase with the Higgs scalar field at finite temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a theory space consisting of a large number of five-dimensional Dirac fermion field theories including background abelian gauge fields, we can construct a theory similar to a continuous six-dimensional theory compactified with two-dimensional manifolds with and without magnetic flux or orbifolds as extra dimensions. This method, called dimensional deconstruction, can be used to construct a model with one-dimensional discrete space, which represents general graph structures. In this paper, we propose the models with two extra dimensions, which resemble two-dimensional tori, cylinders, and rectangular regions, as continuum limits. We also try to build a model that mimics one with the two-dimensional orbifold compactification.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT thermodynamics of charged, rotating black holes in $D=4$ dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the holographic thermodynamics of $4-D$ Kerr-Newman AdS black holes. We consider the conformal thermal states dual to KN AdS black holes and work out the corresponding thermodynamics in 10 ensembles. These ensembles are: fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p,C)$,fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},p,C)$,fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,\mu)$ and fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,p,\mu)$ ensembles. Here $\varphi$, $\mathcal{Q}$, $\Omega$, $\mathcal{J}$, $p$, $\mathcal{V}$, $C$ and $\mu$ denotes the electric potential, electric charge, angular velocity, angular momentum, CFT pressure, CFT volume, central charge, and chemical potential respectively. In the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, we observe a first order phase transition for $\mathcal{Q}&lt;\mathcal{Q}_{crit}$, $\mathcal{J}&lt;\mathcal{J}_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. In the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V}, C)$ ensemble, we again find a first-order phase transition for $\mathcal{Q}&lt;\mathcal{Q}_{crit}$, $\Omega&lt;\Omega_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. The fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V}, C)$ ensemble is characterized by a confinement/de-confinement phase transition. In the fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, we see a first order phase transition for $\mathcal{J}&lt;\mathcal{J}_{crit}$, $\varphi&lt;\varphi_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. Finally, in the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p, C)$,$(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p, C)$,$(\varphi,\mathcal{J},p, C)$,$(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,\mu)$,$(\varphi,\Omega,p,\mu)$ ensembles, we do not observe any critical behavior or phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five dimensional super conformal field theories can be studied using their geometric realisation as a limit of $M$-theory on a metrically conical Calabi-Yau threefold. We utilise this framework to investigate the phases of such theories that arise by varying the couplings away from the conformal point. We demonstrate that many 5d SCFTs, including strongly coupled gauge theories, have couplings giving rise to massive, confining vacua with confining strings and corresponding unbroken 1-form symmetries. The simplest examples arise by considering the parameter space of {\it complete} Ricci flat metrics on discrete quotients of the standard conifold singularity. Varying other couplings produces coupled 5d SCFTs interacting via massive BPS instanton particle states.</description>

      <title>Null Infinity and Horizons: A New Approach to Fluxes and Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework tailored to degrees of freedom (DOF) of field theories that reside in suitable 3-dimensional open regions, and then apply it to the gravitational DOF of general relativity. Specifically, these DOF now refer to open regions of null infinity, and of black hole (and cosmological) horizons representing equilibrium situations. At null infinity the new Hamiltonian framework yields the well-known BMS fluxes and charges. By contrast, all fluxes vanish identically at black hole (and cosmological) horizons just as one would physically expect. In a companion paper we showed that, somewhat surprisingly, the geometry and symmetries of these two physical configurations descend from a common framework. This paper reinforces that theme: Very different physics emerges in the two cases from a common Hamiltonian framework because of the difference in the nature of degrees of freedom. Finally, we compare and contrast this Hamiltonian approach with those available in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider formulating $D$ dimensional gauge theories, with the focus on the case of gravity theories, in spacetimes with boundaries. We extend covariant phase space formalism to the cases in which boundaries are allowed to fluctuate. We analyze the symplectic form, the freedoms (ambiguities), and its conservation for this case. We show that boundary fluctuations render all the surface charges integrable. We study the algebra of charges and its central extensions, charge conservation, and fluxes. We briefly comment on memory effects and questions regarding semiclassical aspects of black holes in the fluctuating boundary setup.</description>

      <title>Macdonald polynomials for super-partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce generalization of famous Macdonald polynomials for the case of super-Young diagrams that contain half-boxes on the equal footing with full boxes. These super-Macdonald polynomials are polynomials of extended set of variables: usual $p_k$ variables are accompanied by anti-commuting Grassmann variables $\theta_k$. Starting from recently defined super-Schur polynomials and exploiting orthogonality relations with triangular decompositions we are able to fully determine super-Macdonald polynomials. These new polynomials have similar properties to canonical Macdonald polynomials -- they respect two different orderings in the set of (super)-Young diagrams simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in TGFT: Landau-Ginzburg analysis of the causally complete Lorentzian Barrett-Crane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is expected that continuum spacetime emerges via phase transition in the tensorial group field theory (TGFT) approach to quantum gravity. Recent work on the application of Landau-Ginzburg mean-field theory to progressively realistic TGFT models has demonstrated how phase transitions can be realized therein. Here, we further develop this setting and consider the causally complete Lorentzian Barrett-Crane (BC) model which includes not only spacelike but also timelike and lightlike tetrahedra as quantum geometric building blocks. In addition, we incorporate discretized scalar fields by $\mathbb{R}$-valued variables of the group fields. In this context, we analyze models with an arbitrary single interaction of simplicial and tensor-invariant type, extend it to the model with the two vertices well-known from causal dynamical triangulations, and also consider a model with colored simplicial interactions. As a main result, we demonstrate for all those cases that a mean-field approximation of a phase transition towards a non-trivial condensate state can always be realized. In particular, we show that the critical behavior is entirely driven by spacelike faces which are characterized by the boost part of the Lorentz group. The latter induces an exponential suppression of fluctuations which then stabilizes the mean-field vacuum. In contrast, timelike faces do not play a role in this as they are characterized by the rotational and thus compact part of the Lorentz group. Since such a state is typically populated by a large number of TGFT quanta, our work lends further considerable support to the existence of a sensible continuum gravitational regime for causally complete TGFT models. Our results also indirectly strengthen the derivation of effective cosmological dynamics and the recently improved study of scalar cosmological perturbations within a mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>A Max-Flow approach to Random Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy of a random tensor network (RTN) using tools from free probability theory. Random tensor networks are simple toy models that help the understanding of the entanglement behavior of a boundary region in the ADS/CFT context. One can think of random tensor networks are specific probabilistic models for tensors having some particular geometry dictated by a graph (or network) structure. We first introduce our model of RTN, obtained by contracting maximally entangled states (corresponding to the edges of the graph) on the tensor product of Gaussian tensors (corresponding to the vertices of the graph). We study the entanglement spectrum of the resulting random spectrum along a given bipartition of the local Hilbert spaces. We provide the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the reduced density operator of the RTN state, in the limit of large local dimension. The limit value is described via a maximum flow optimization problem in a new graph corresponding to the geometry of the RTN and the given bipartition. In the case of series-parallel graphs, we provide an explicit formula for the limiting eigenvalue distribution using classical and free multiplicative convolutions. We discuss the physical implications of our results, allowing us to go beyond the semiclassical regime without any cut assumption, specifically in terms of finite corrections to the average entanglement entropy of the RTN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended dark matter objects (EDOs) are popular dark matter candidates that interact gravitationally with the Standard Model. These gravitational interactions can be used to constrain their allowed parameter space. However, EDOs can have different formation mechanisms, sizes, and shapes, requiring a case-by-case analysis when studying their impact on different areas of cosmology. We thus present a repository of all available bounds for these objects, with a code that allows plotting user-defined combinations of all up-to-date bounds for a given shape and different radii. We propose a standard for the EDOs' mass profiles so that different sets of bounds are consistent with each other, and provide instructions on using the code and contributing to the repository.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between gravitational anomalies and Hawking radiation of black holes was revealed by Wilczek and Robinson. In this study, we apply their method to an analogue de Sitter spacetime in the quantum Hall system with an expanding edge. Because this system is chiral, there is no need to impose the condition of ingoing modes near the horizon, which was assumed in the original method. Moreover, this system is structured so that the de Sitter space is sandwiched between two flat spaces, and although the effects of the anomaly would not appear in an ordinal de Sitter spacetime, they manifest themselves as boundary conditions between the de Sitter and the flat regions. By performing calculations under these boundary conditions, we obtain the flux of Hawking radiation in the outer flat region with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the de Sitter horizon.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum from inflation/bouncing Universe in VCDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the non-linear interactions within the VCDM model, a type II minimally modified gravity model with the same number of degrees of freedom as in General Relativity but not connected to the latter by field redefinitions. During an inflationary phase in the early universe, if the VCDM potential does not modify the slow-roll behavior of the inflaton field, we recover, up to the leading order, the standard results for the bispectrum in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, if the VCDM potential becomes dominant, the interactions can strongly deviate and even violate the Maldacena's consistency relation for the local non-Gaussianities. Furthermore, we apply the formalism to the recently introduced bouncing model in VCDM, and show that the bispectrum still respects current observational constraints. Future measurements on non-Gaussianities of the local type should provide the test ground for the model's validity.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this work is to do a systematic feasibility study of measuring in backward region deeply virtual Compton scattering on the pion in Sullivan processes in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion to photon transition distribution amplitudes (TDAs) describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. Our approach employs TDAs based on the overlap of light front wave functions, using a previously developed pion light-front wave function and deriving a consistent model for the light front wave functions of the photon. This work is expected to lead us to an estimate of the cross-sections that could be measured in the future U.S. and China's electron-ion colliders. It will also provide a comparison with the forward Sullivan DVCS case, which gives access to pion GPDs and for which a strong signal is expected.</description>

      <title>Tensor Networks for Lattice Gauge Theories beyond one dimension: a Roadmap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods are a class of numerical tools and algorithms to study many-body quantum systems in and out of equilibrium, based on tailored variational wave functions. They have found significant applications in simulating lattice gauge theories approaching relevant problems in high-energy physics. Compared to Monte Carlo methods, they do not suffer from the sign problem, allowing them to explore challenging regimes such as finite chemical potentials and real-time dynamics. Further development is required to tackle fundamental challenges, such as accessing continuum limits or computations of large-scale quantum chromodynamics. In this work, we review the state-of-the-art of Tensor Network methods and discuss a possible roadmap for algorithmic development and strategies to enhance their capabilities and extend their applicability to open high-energy problems. We provide tailored estimates of the theoretical and computational resource scaling for attacking large-scale lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the phase space of a constantly curved tetrahedron with fixed triangle areas in terms of a pair of Darboux coordinates called the length and twist coordinates, which are in analogy to the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for flat connections, and their quantization. The curvature is identified to the value of the cosmological constant, either positive or negative. The physical Hilbert space is given by the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ intertwiner space. We show that the quantum trace of quantum monodromies, defining the quantum length operators, form a fusion algebra and describe their representation theory. We also construct the coherent states in the physical Hilbert space labeled by the length and twist coordinates. These coherent states describe quantum curved tetrahedra and peak at points of the tetrahedron phase space. This works is closely related to 3+1 dimensional Loop Quantum Gravity with a non-vanishing cosmological constant. The coherent states constructed herein serve as good candidates for the application to the spinfoam model with a cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We study supersymmetric AdS$_6$ black holes at large angular momenta, from the index of 5d SCFTs on $S^4\times\mathbb{R}$ in the large $N$ and Cardy limit. Our examples are the strong coupling limits of 5d gauge theories on the D4-D8-O8 system. The large $N$ free energy scales like $N^{5/2}$, statistically accounting for the entropy of large black holes in AdS$_6$. Instanton solitons play subtle roles to realize these deconfined degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge formulation of Einstein gravity in AdS$_3$ background leads to a boundary theory that breaks modular symmetry and loses the covariant form. We examine the Weyl anomaly for the cylinder and torus manifolds. The divergent term is the same as the Liouville theory when transforming from the cylinder to the sphere. The general Weyl transformation on the torus also reproduces the Liouville theory. The Weyl transformation introduces an additional boundary term for reproducing the Liouville theory, which allows the use of CFT techniques to analyze the theory. The torus partition function in this boundary theory is one-loop exact, and an analytical solution to disjoint two-interval R\'enyi-2 mutual information can be obtained. We also discuss a first-order phase transition for the separation length of two intervals, which occurs at the classical level but is smoothed out by non-perturbative effects captured by averaging over a modular group in the boundary theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for classical Liouville field theory, diffeomorphism invariance, Weyl invariance and locality cannot hold together. This is due to a genuine Virasoro center, present in the theory, that leads to an energy\hyp{}momentum tensor with non-tensorial conformal transformations, in flat space, and with a non-vanishing trace, in curved space. Our focus is on a field-independent term, proportional to the square of the Weyl gauge field, $W_\mu W^\mu$, that makes the action Weyl-invariant and was disregarded in previous investigations of Weyl and conformal symmetry. We show this term to be related to the classical center of the Virasoro algebra. The mechanism uncovered here is a classical version of the quantum anomalous phenomenon: the generalization to curved space only allows to keep one of the two symmetries enjoyed by the flat space theory, either Lorentz (diffeomorphism) or conformal invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The constraints arising from anomaly cancellation are particular strong for chiral theories in six dimensions. We make progress towards a complete classification of 6D supergravities with minimal supersymmetry and non-abelian gauge group. First, we generalize a previously known infinite class of anomaly-free theories which has $T\gg 9$ to essentially any semi-simple gauge group and infinitely many choices for hypermultiplets. The construction relies on having many decoupled sectors all selected from a list of four simple theories which we identify. Second, we use ideas from graph theory to rephrase the task of finding anomaly-free theories as constructing cliques in a certain multigraph. A branch-and-bound type algorithm is described which can be used to explicitly construct, in a $T$-independent way, anomaly-free theories with an arbitrary number of simple factors in the gauge group. We implement these ideas to generate an ensemble of $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ irreducible cliques from which anomaly-free theories may be easily built, and as a special case obtain a complete list of $19,\!847$ consistent theories for $T=0$, for which the maximal gauge group rank is $24$. Modulo $\mathrm{U}(1)$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ simple factors and the new infinite families, we give a complete characterization of anomaly-free theories and show that the bound $T\leq 273$ is sharp.</description>

      <title>Differential Equations for Cosmological Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological fluctuations retain a memory of the physics that generated them in their spatial correlations. The strength of correlations varies smoothly as a function of external kinematics, which is encoded in differential equations satisfied by cosmological correlation functions. In this work, we provide a broader perspective on the origin and structure of these differential equations. As a concrete example, we study conformally coupled scalar fields in a power-law cosmology. The wavefunction coefficients in this model have integral representations, with the integrands being the product of the corresponding flat-space results and "twist factors" that depend on the cosmological evolution. These integrals are part of a finite-dimensional basis of master integrals, which satisfy a system of first-order differential equations. We develop a formalism to derive these differential equations for arbitrary tree graphs. The results can be represented in graphical form by associating the singularities of the differential equations with a set of graph tubings. Upon differentiation, these tubings grow in a local and predictive fashion. In fact, a few remarkably simple rules allow us to predict -- by hand -- the equations for all tree graphs. While the rules of this "kinematic flow" are defined purely in terms of data on the boundary of the spacetime, they reflect the physics of bulk time evolution. We also study the analogous structures in ${\rm tr}\,\phi^3$ theory, and see some glimpses of hidden structure in the sum over planar graphs. This suggests that there is an autonomous combinatorial or geometric construction from which cosmological correlations, and the associated spacetime, emerge.</description>

Abstract: The Hilbert spaces of matrix quantum mechanical systems with $N \times N$ matrix degrees of freedom $ X $ have been analysed recently in terms of $S_N$ symmetric group elements $U$ acting as $X \rightarrow U X U^T $. Solvable models have been constructed uncovering partition algebras as hidden symmetries of these systems. The solvable models include an 11-dimensional space of matrix harmonic oscillators, the simplest of which is the standard matrix harmonic oscillator with $U(N)$ symmetry. The permutation symmetry is realised as gauge symmetry in a path integral formulation in a companion paper. With the simplest matrix oscillator Hamiltonian subject to gauge permutation symmetry, we use the known result for the micro-canonical partition function to derive the canonical partition function. It is expressed as a sum over partitions of $N$ of products of factors which depend on elementary number-theoretic properties of the partitions, notably the least common multiples and greatest common divisors of pairs of parts appearing in the partition. This formula is recovered using the Molien-Weyl formula, which we review for convenience. The Molien-Weyl formula is then used to generalise the formula for the canonical partition function to the 11-parameter permutation invariant matrix harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in the presence of non-conformality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behaviour of a chaotic system and its effect on existing quantum correlation has been holographically studied in presence of non-conformality. Keeping in mind the gauge/gravity duality framework, the non-conformality in the dual field theory has been introduced by considering a Liouville type dilaton potential for the gravitational theory. The resulting black brane solution is associated with a parameter $\eta$ which represents the deviation from conformality. The parameters of chaos, namely, the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity are computed by following the well-known shock wave analysis. The obtained results reveal that presence of non-conformality leads to suppression of the chaotic nature of a system. Further, for a particular value of the non-conformal parameter $\eta$, the system achieves Lyapunov stability resulting from the vanishing of both the Lyapunov exponent and as well as butterfly velocity. Interestingly, this particular value of $\eta$ matches with the previously given upper bound of $\eta$ known as Gubser bound in the literature. The effects of chaos and non-conformality on the existing correlation of a thermofield doublet state have been quantified by holographically computing the thermo mutual information in both the presence and absence of the shock wave. Furthermore, the entanglement velocity is also computed and the effect of non-conformality on it has been observed. Finally, the obtained results for the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity have also been computed from the pole-skipping analysis. The results from the two approaches agree with each other.</description>

      <title>A new infinite class of $6d$, $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supergravities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new infinite class of non-abelian, 6d supergravities with eight supercharges. These theories not only satisfy all known low-energy consistency conditions, such as being free of anomalies, but also evade the constraints arising from the consistency of string probes, even after assuming BPS completeness. This demonstrates that some additional UV input or hitherto unknown IR condition is needed in order to be left with a finite landscape, as is generally anticipated from a theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the topological defect lines commuting with the spectral flow and the $\mathcal{N}=(4,4)$ superconformal symmetry in two dimensional non-linear sigma models on K3. By studying their fusion with boundary states, we derive a number of general results for the category of such defects. We argue that while for certain K3 models infinitely many simple defects, and even a continuum, can occur, at generic points in the moduli space the category is actually trivial, i.e. it is generated by the identity defect. Furthermore, we show that if a K3 model is at the attractor point for some BPS configuration of D-branes, then all topological defects have integral quantum dimension. We also conjecture that a continuum of topological defects arises if and only if the K3 model is a (possibly generalized) orbifold of a torus model. Finally, we test our general results in a couple of examples, where we provide a partial classification of the topological defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new model of string inflation driven by a blow-up K\"ahler modulus of type IIb compactifications with a potential generated by string loops. Slow-roll is naturally realized thanks to the fact that the blow-up mode is a leading-order flat direction lifted by string loops which are unavoidable and generate a plateau at large field values. We check that throughout the whole inflationary dynamics the effective field theory is under control. We perform a phenomenological analysis determining the exact number of efoldings by studying the post-inflationary evolution. We determine the values of the microscopic parameters which lead to agreement with CMB data, together with the prediction of a tensor-to-scalar ratio of order $r\sim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Chern Characteristics and Todd-Hirzebruch Identities for Transpolar Pairs of Toric Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard toric geometry methods used to construct Calabi-Yau varieties may be extended to complete intersections in non-Fano varieties encoded by star triangulating non-convex polytopes. Similarly, mirror symmetry is conjectured to hold in terms of a transpolar duality generalizing the original construction of Batyrev and Borisov. The associated mirror pairs naturally include certain flip-folded, multi-layered multihedral objects, inclusively named VEX multitopes, and a correspondingly generalized transpolar duality. These self-overlaying VEX multitopes, long since known in pre-symplectic geometry, are found to correspond to certain non-algebraic but smooth toric spaces with Chern classes that satisfy the standard Todd-Hirzebruch identities. The computation of diffeomorphism invariants, including characteristic submanifold intersection numbers, corroborates their recent inclusion in the connected web of Calabi-Yau spaces and associated string compactifications: They arise together with the standard (Fano/reflexive polytope) constructions, within deformation families of generalized complete intersections in products of projective spaces.</description>

Abstract: The Emergence Proposal suggests that some Swampland criteria, in particular on large field distances, are a consequence of the emergent nature of dynamics for fields in the infrared. In the context of type II string theory compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, it proposes that the cubic tree-level piece of the genus-zero prepotential is emergent from integrating out massive non-perturbative states. For a certain special non-compact Calabi-Yau, the blown-up conifold, it is known that the full all-genus prepotential can be matched onto the Grand Canonical potential of a two-dimensional Fermi gas. We propose here that this should be understood in the context of emergence: the prepotential is induced by integrating out the Fermi gas degrees of freedom. To make contact with the Swampland we need dynamical gravity, so compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show that for specifically the cubic term, an integrating out calculation also works for compact cases. In particular, the exact cubic term coefficient can be recovered from integrating out a Fermi gas for any compact Calabi-Yau that is an elliptic fibration over a reflexive toric base. We also propose a general map, for any one-parameter Calabi-Yau, between the Grand Canonical potential of the ultraviolet non-perturbative system and the period. In particular, this map leads to an emergent cubic term in the genus-zero prepotential for any such one-parameter model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two parameter family of string field theory vertices, which we refer to as hyperbolic Kaku vertices. It is defined in terms of hyperbolic metrics on the Riemann surface, but the geometry is allowed to depend on inputs of the states. The vertices are defined for both open and closed strings. In either case, the family contains the hyperbolic vertices. Then we show that the open string lightcone vertex is obtained as the flat limit of the hyperbolic Kaku vertices. The open string Kaku vertices, which interpolate between the Witten vertex and the open string lightcone vertex, is also obtained as a flat limit. We use the same limit on the case of closed strings to define the closed string Kaku vertices: a one parameter family of vertices that interpolates between the polyhedral vertices - which are covariant, but not cubic - and the closed string lightcone vertex - which is cubic, but not Lorentz covariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the 3-sphere partition functions of various 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ holographic SCFTs arising from the $N$ stack of M2-branes in the 't Hooft limit both analytically and numerically. We first employ a saddle point approximation to evaluate the free energy $F=-\log Z$ at the planar level, tracking the first subleading corrections in the large 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ expansion. Subsequently, we improve these results by determining the planar free energy to all orders in the large $\lambda$ expansion via numerical analysis. Remarkably, the resulting planar free energies turn out to take a universal form, supporting a prediction that these $S^3$ partition functions are all given in terms of an Airy function even beyond the special cases where the Airy formulae were derived analytically in the literature; in this context we also present new Airy conjectures in several examples. The subleading behaviors we captured encode a part of quantum corrections to the M-theory path integrals around dual asymptotically Euclidean AdS$_4$ backgrounds with the corresponding internal manifolds through holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature. We further provide evidence that these thermodynamic properties hold in systems with $U(N)$ symmetry such as the zero charge sector of the 2-matrix model and in certain tensor models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the negative specific heat capacities in gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on M5-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The M5-brane has been argued to potentially provide much-needed theoretical underpinning for various non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-coupled quantum systems and yet the primary non-perturbative effect already in its classical on-shell formulation has received little attention: The flux-quantization of the higher gauge field on its worldvolume.
  This problem appears subtle because of (1a.) the notorious self-duality of the 3-form flux density in the small field limit, combined with (1b.) its highly non-linear self-duality for strong fields, and (2a.) the twisting of its Bianchi identity by the pullback of the 11d SuGra C-field flux density, which (2b.) is subject to its own subtle flux quantization law on the ambient spacetime.
  These subtleties call into question the tacit assumption that the M5 brane's 3-flux is quantized in ordinary cohomology and hence leaves open the rather fundamental question of what the M5-brane's worldvolume higher gauge field really is.
  Here we characterize the valid quantization laws of the M5-brane's 3-flux in (non-abelian) generalized twisted cohomology. The key step is to pass to super-spacetime and there to combine the character map with the "super-embedding"-construction of the on-shell M5-brane fields, of which we give a rigorous and streamlined re-rederivation.
  We show that one admissible quantization law of the 3-flux on M5-branes is by 4-Cohomotopy-twisted 3-Cohomotopy, as predicted by "Hypothesis H". Besides quantizing the bulk fluxes (G4,G7) and the brane's H3-flux themselves, this law also implies the (level-)quantization of the induced Page-charge/Hopf-WZ term on the M5-brane, necessary for its action functional to be globally well-defined.
  Finally, we demonstrate how with this flux quantization imposed, there generically appear skyrmionic solitons on M5-branes and anyonic topological quantum states on open M5-branes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct compactifications of type IIB string theory that yield, at leading order in the $\alpha^\prime$ and $g_s$ expansions, de Sitter vacua of the form envisioned by Kachru, Kallosh, Linde, and Trivedi. We specify explicit Calabi-Yau orientifolds and quantized fluxes for which we derive the four-dimensional effective supergravity theories, incorporating the exact flux superpotential, the nonperturbative superpotential from Euclidean D3-branes, and the K\"ahler potential at tree level in the string loop expansion but to all orders in $\alpha'$. Each example includes a Klebanov-Strassler throat region containing a single anti-D3-brane, whose supersymmetry-breaking energy, computed at leading order in $\alpha'$, causes an uplift to a metastable de Sitter vacuum in which all moduli are stabilized. Finding vacua that demonstrably survive subleading corrections, and in which the quantization conditions are completely understood, is an important open problem for which this work has prepared the foundations.</description>

Abstract: We consider two-dimensional quantum gravity endowed with a positive cosmological constant and coupled to a conformal field theory of large and positive central charge. We study cosmological properties at the classical and quantum level. We provide a complete ADM analysis of the classical phase space, revealing a family of either bouncing or big bang/crunch type cosmologies. At the quantum level, we solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly. In the semiclassical limit, we link the Wheeler-DeWitt state space to the classical phase space. Wavefunctionals of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin type are identified, and we uncover a quantum version of the bouncing spacetime. We retrieve the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction from the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory. To do so, we must select a particular contour in the space of complexified fields. The quantum information content of the big bang cosmology is discussed, and contrasted with the de Sitter horizon entropy as computed by a gravitational path integral over the two-sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:hep-th/0504187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists a certain limit in type I and type II superstring theory in the presence of a suitable configuration of magnetic U(1) fields where all string excitations get an infinite mass, except for the neutral massless sector and for the boson and fermion string states lying on the leading Regge trajectory. For a supersymmetric configuration of magnetic fields in internal directions, the resulting theory after the limit is a 3+1 Lorentz invariant supersymmetric theory. Supersymmetry can be broken by introducing extra components of the magnetic field or else by finite temperature. In both cases we compute the one-loop partition function for the type I string model after taking the limit, which turns out to be different from the Yang-Mills result that arises by a direct $\alpha'\to 0$ limit. In the case of finite temperature, no Hagedorn transition appears, in consistency with the reduction of the string spectrum. In type II superstring theory, the analogous limit is constructed by starting with a configuration of Melvin twists in two or more complex planes. The resulting theory contains gravitation plus an infinite number of states of the leading Regge trajectory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the bubble wall velocity for a large jump in degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bubble expansion velocity is an important parameter in the prediction of gravitational waves from first order phase transitions. This parameter is difficult to compute, especially in phase transitions in strongly coupled theories. In this work, we present a method to estimate the wall velocity for phase transitions with a large enthalpy jump, valid for weakly and strongly coupled theories. We find that detonations are disfavored in this limit, but wall velocities are not necessarily small. We also investigate the effect of two other features in the equation of state: non-conformal sound speeds and a limited range of temperatures for which the phases exist. We find that the former can increase the wall velocity for a given nucleation temperature, and the latter can restrict the wall velocities to small values. To test our approach, we use holographic phase transitions, which typically display these three features. We find excellent agreement with numerically obtained values of the wall velocity. We also demonstrate that the implications for gravitational waves can be significant.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to establish a connection between Pisarski's fixed point and a (2+3)-spin-glass model with sextic confinement potential. This is made possible by the unconventional power-counting induced by the effective kinetics provided by the disorder coupling in the large $N$-limit. Because of the absence of epsilon expansion, our approach is more attractive than the previous one. It may be relevant to the signal detection issue in nearly continuous spectra.</description>

      <title>Chiral Magnetic Effect in Heavy Ion Collisions: The Present and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Corrections to the inflationary spectrum in a Bohmian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A precise interpretation of the Universe wave function is forbidden in the spirit of the Copenhagen School since a precise notion of measure operation cannot be satisfactorily defined. Here we propose a Bohmian interpretation of the isotropic Universe quantum dynamics, in which the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is restated by including quantum corrections, which lead to a classical trajectory containing effects of order $\hbar^2$. This solution is then used to determine the spectrum of gauge-invariant quantum fluctuations living on the obtained background model. The analysis is performed adopting the wave function approach to describe the fluctuation dynamics, which gives a time-dependent harmonic oscillator for each Fourier mode and whose frequency is affected by the $\hbar^2$ corrections. The properties of the emerging spectrum are discussed, outlining the modification induced with respect to the scale-invariant result and the hierarchy of the spectral index running is discussed.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlation functions in the Ising field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite temperature dynamical correlation functions of the magnetization operator in the one-dimensional Ising quantum field theory. Our approach is based on a finite temperature form factor series and on a Fredholm determinant representation of the correlators. While for space-like separations the Fredholm determinant can be efficiently evaluated numerically, for the time-like region it has convergence issues inherited from the form factor series. We develop a method to compute the correlation functions at time-like separations based on the analytic continuation of the space-time coordinates to complex values. Using this numerical technique, we explore all space-time and temperature regimes in both the ordered and disordered phases including short, large, and near-light-cone separations at low and high temperatures. We confirm the existing analytic predictions for the asymptotic behavior of the correlations except in the case of space-like correlations in the paramagnetic phase. For this case we derive a new closed form expression for the correlation length that has some unusual properties: it is a non-analytic function of both the space-time direction and the temperature, and its temperature dependence is non-monotonic.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets, a New Anomaly, Instantons, and (noninvertible) Continuous Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of classical field theories with continuous translation symmetry. In the quantum theory, a new anomaly explicitly breaks this translation symmetry to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, this discrete translation symmetry is extended by a $d-2$-form global symmetry. All these theories can be described as $U(1)$ gauge theories where Gauss law states that the system has nonzero charge density. Special cases of such systems can be phrased as theories with a compact phase space. Examples are ferromagnets and lattices in the lowest Landau level. In some cases, the broken continuous translation symmetry can be resurrected as a noninvertible symmetry. We clarify the relation between the discrete translation symmetry of the continuum theory and the discrete translation symmetry of an underlying lattice model. Our treatment unifies, clarifies, and extends earlier works on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Robust Hilbert space fragmentation in group-valued loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>
