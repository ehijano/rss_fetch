      <title>Non-associative versions of Hilbert's basis theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several new versions of Hilbert's basis theorem for non-associative Ore extensions and non-associative skew Laurent polynomial rings, non-associative skew power series rings, and non-associative skew Laurent series rings. For non-associative skew Laurent polynomial rings, we show that both a left and a right version of Hilbert's basis theorem hold. For non-associative Ore extensions, we show that a right version holds, but give a counterexample to a left version; a difference that does not appear in the associative setting.</description>

      <title>Quiver connections and bimodules of basic algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of classifying quantum symmetries of non-semisimple, finite-dimensional associative algebras, we define a notion of connection between bounded quivers and build a bicategory of bounded quivers and quiver connections. We prove this bicategory is equivalent to a bicategory of basic algebras, bimodules, and intertwiners with some additional structure.</description>

      <title>Partial representations of connected and smash product Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every partial representation of a connected Hopf algebra is global. Some interesting classes of partial representations of smash product Hopf algebras are studied, and a description of the partial "Hopf" algebra if the first tensorand is connected is given. If $H$ is cocommutative and has finitely many grouplikes, this allows to see $H_{par}$ as the weak Hopf algebra coming from a Hopf category.</description>

      <title>Filtered Boolean powers of finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{A}$ be a finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebra (e.g. a group, loop, ring). We investigate the Boolean power $\mathbf{D}$ of $\mathbf{A}$ by the countable atomless Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$ filtered at some idempotents $e_1,\dots,e_n$ of $\mathbf{A}$. When $e_1,\dots,e_n$ are all idempotents of $\mathbf{A}$ we establish two concrete representations of $\mathbf{D}$: as the Fra\"iss\'e limit of the class of finite direct powers of $\mathbf{A}$, and as congruence classes of the countable free algebra in the variety generated by $\mathbf{A}$. Further, for arbitrary $e_1,\dots,e_n$, we show that $\mathbf{D}$ is $\omega$-categorical and that its automorphism group has the small index property, strong uncountable cofinality and the Bergman property. As necessary background we establish some general properties of congruences and automorphisms of filtered Boolean powers of $\mathbf{A}$ by any Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$, including a semidirect decomposition for their automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>On some counterparts of Rickart $*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11519v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we introduce and study counterparts of Rickart involutive algebras, i.e., almost inner Rickart algebras. We prove that a nilpotent associative algebra, which has no nilpotent elements with nonzero square roots, is an almost inner Rickart algebra. A nilpotent associative algebra, which has no nilpotent elements with a square root $b$ such that $b^3\neq 0$, is not an almost inner Rickart algebra if there exists a nonzero element $a$ such that $a^2\neq 0$. As a main result of the paper, we describe a finite-dimensional almost inner Rickart algebra $\mathcal{A}$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}^n\dot{+} \mathcal{N}$, $n=1,2$, with a nilradical $\mathcal{N}$. Also, we classify finite-dimensional almost inner Rickart algebras over the real or complex numbers with a nonzero nilradical $\mathcal{N}$.</description>

      <title>Quotient Modules of Finite Length and Their Relation to Fredholm Elements in Semiprime Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: B. A. Barnes introduced so-called Fredholm elements in a semiprime ring whose definition is inspired by Atkinson's theorem. Here the socle of a semiprime ring generalizes the ideal of finite-rank operators on a Banach space. In this paper, we aim to see that the algebraic concept of the length of a module is strongly related to that of Fredholm elements. This motivates another generalization of Fredholm elements by requiring for an element $a\in\mathcal{A}$ that the $\mathcal{A}$-modules of the form $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{A} a$ and $\mathcal{A}/a\mathcal{A}$ are of finite length. We are particularly interested in sufficient conditions for our generalized Fredholm elements to be Fredholm. In a unital C$^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ we shall even see that an element $a\in\mathcal{A}$ is Fredholm if and only if the $\mathcal{A}$-modules $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{A} a$ and $\mathcal{A}/a\mathcal{A}$ both have finite length.</description>

      <title>Topological finiteness properties of monoids. Part 2: special monoids, one-relator monoids, amalgamated free products, and HNN extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.03413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how topological methods developed in a previous article can be applied to prove new results about topological and homological finiteness properties of monoids. A monoid presentation is called special if the right-hand side of each relation is equal to $1$. We prove results which relate the finiteness properties of a monoid defined by a special presentation with those of its group of units. Specifically we show that the monoid inherits the finiteness properties $F_n$ and $FP_n$ from its group of units. We also obtain results which relate the geometric and cohomological dimensions of such a monoid to those of its group of units. We apply these results to prove a Lyndon's Identity Theorem for one-relator monoids of the form $\langle A \mid r=1 \rangle$. In particular we show that all such monoids are of type $F_{\infty}$ (and $FP_{\infty}$), and that when $r$ is not a proper power, then the monoid has geometric and cohomological dimension at most $2$. The first of these results resolves an important case of a question of Kobayashi from 2000 on homological finiteness properties of one-relator monoids. We also show how our topological approach can be used to prove results about the closure properties of various homological and topological finiteness properties for amalgamated free products and HNN-extensions of monoids. To prove these results we introduce new methods for constructing equivariant classifying spaces for monoids, as well as developing a Bass-Serre theory for free constructions of monoids.</description>

      <title>Denseness of $g$-vector cones from weighted orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $g$-vector cones in a cluster algebra defined from a weighted orbifold of rank $n$ introduced by Felikson, Shapiro and Tumarkin. We determine the closure of the union of the $g$-vector cones. It is equal to $\mathbb{R}^n$ except for a weighted orbifold with empty boundary and exactly one puncture, in which case it is equal to the half space of a certain explicit hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>A semigroup with linearithmic Dehn function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that there is no finitely presented group for which the Dehn function lies asymptotically strictly between linear and quadratic functions. This work presents an example of a semigroup that has Dehn function equivalent to $n \log n$, thus it lies strictly inside the said gap. The example is obtained by symmetrizing the rewriting rules of a particular semi-Thue system, which has the derivational complexity function $n \log n$. We also show that such connection is not universal by providing a semi-Thue system, for which the Dehn function of the symmetrized semigroup asymptotically differs from the derivational complexity of the initial system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a geometrization of semicanonical bases of quantum groups via Grothendieck groups of the derived categories of Lusztig's nilpotent varieties. Meanwhile, we describe the dual semicanonical bases in terms of Serre polynomials of Grassmannians of modules over preprojective algebras.</description>
