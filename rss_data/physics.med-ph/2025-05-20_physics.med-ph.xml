      <title>Investigating the Impact of Arterial Irregularity On Clinical Parameters Using Reduced Order CFD Models In Stenosed Coronary Artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a novel approach that integrates patient-specific Multi-slice CT scans into CAD models, using a one-dimensional numerical framework to assess varying degrees of coronary artery stenosis. The computational analysis encompasses the entire arterial tree, with a particular focus on stenosed coronary arteries modeled analytically. Key parameters, such as area and velocity, are derived from one-dimensional characteristic equations based on forward and backward characteristic variables. A resistance model with zero reflection coefficient and realistic pressure waveform inputs is applied at the outflow and inflow, respectively. The global characteristics captured by the 1D model serve as boundary conditions for a 2D axisymmetric model that focuses on local characteristics. The numerical solvers are validated against existing literature, ensuring grid independence. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and Instantaneous wave-free Ratio (iFR) are calculated using various non-Newtonian models across different stenosis severities. The study also investigates the impact of lesion irregularity in stenosed coronary arteries, finding that irregular arteries exhibit lower FFR and iFR values and higher pressure drops, indicating increased blood flow resistance. This method provides a reliable, non-invasive diagnostic tool for evaluating the functional severity of irregular coronary artery stenosis in clinical settings, effectively capturing both global and local hemodynamic characteristics.</description>

      <title>High-energy X-ray phase-contrast CT of an adult human chest phantom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propagation-based phase-contrast X-ray imaging is a promising technique for in~vivo medical imaging, offering lower radiation doses than traditional attenuation-based imaging. Previous studies have focused on X-ray energies below 50 keV for small-animal imaging and mammography. Here, we investigate the feasibility of high-energy propagation-based computed tomography for human adult-scale lung imaging at the Australian Synchrotron's Imaging and Medical Beamline. This facility is uniquely positioned for human lung imaging, offering a large field of view, high X-ray energies, and supporting clinical infrastructure. We imaged an anthropomorphic chest phantom (LungMan) between 50 keV and 80 keV across the range of possible sample-to-detector distances, with a photon-counting and an integrating detector. Strong phase-contrast fringes were observed with the photon-counting detector, even at high X-ray energies and a large pixel size relative to previous work, whereas the integrating detector with lower spatial resolution showed no clear phase effects. Measured X-ray phase-shifting properties of LungMan aligned well with reference soft tissue values, validating the phantom for phase-contrast studies. Imaging quality assessments suggest an optimal configuration at approximately 70 keV and the longest available propagation distance of 7.5 m, indicating potential benefit in positioning the patient in an upstream hutch. This study represents the first step towards clinical adult lung imaging at the Australian Synchrotron.</description>

      <title>A fully flexible joint lattice position and dose optimization method for LATTICE therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice radiotherapy (LATTICE) is a form of spatially fractionated radiation therapy (SFRT) designed to deliver high doses to tumor regions while sparing surrounding tissues. Traditional LATTICE uses rigid vertex patterns, limiting adaptability for irregular tumors or those near critical organs. This study introduces a novel planning method with flexible vertex placement and joint optimization of vertex positions and dose distribution, enhancing treatment precision. The method integrates vertex positioning with other treatment variables within a constrained optimization framework, allowing dynamic adjustments. Results showed that plans generated with the new method (NEW) demonstrated superior or comparable quality to conventional LATTICE plans, with improvements in the optimization objective and peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR). This approach offers significant improvements in target dose conformity and OAR sparing, providing an enhanced LATTICE technique.</description>
