      <title>Scalable Lithium Niobate Nanoimprinting for Nonlinear Metalenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturizing nonlinear optical components is essential for integrating advanced light manipulation into compact photonic devices, enabling scalable and cost-effective applications. While monocrystalline lithium niobate thin films advance nonlinear nanophotonics, their high inertness limits the design of top-down fabricated nanostructures. Here we present a versatile bottom-up fabrication method based on nanoimprint lithography for achieving polycrystalline lithium niobate nanostructures, and demonstrate its significant potential for nonlinear metasurfaces. The fabrication enables nearly vertical features and aspect ratios of up to 6, which we combine with a novel solution-derived material with high effective second-order nonlinearity of d_{eff}=5 pm/V. On this platform, we demonstrate second-harmonic focusing over a broad spectral range from near-UV to near-IR, increasing the nonlinear signal intensity by up to 34 times. Our method enables the first lithium niobate metalens and expands the field of nonlinear metasurfaces by providing a low-cost, highly scalable fabrication method for engineered nonlinear nanostructures</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Analog Processing with Anisotropic Nonlinear Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital signal processing is the cornerstone of several modern-day technologies, yet in multiple applications it faces critical bottlenecks related to memory and speed constraints. Thanks to recent advances in metasurface design and fabrication, light-based analog computing has emerged as a viable option to partially replace or augment digital approaches. Several light-based analog computing functionalities have been demonstrated using patterned flat optical elements, with great opportunities for integration in compact nanophotonic systems. So far, however, the available operations have been restricted to the linear regime, limiting the impact of this technology to a compactification of Fourier optics systems. In this paper, we introduce nonlinear operations to the field of metasurface-based analog optical processing, demonstrating that nonlinear optical phenomena, combined with nonlocality in flat optics, can be leveraged to synthesize kernels beyond linear Fourier optics, paving the way to a broad range of new opportunities. As a practical demonstration, we report the experimental synthesis of a class of nonlinear operations that can be used to realize broadband, polarization-selective analog-domain edge detection.</description>

      <title>Optical multi-beam steering and communication using integrated acousto-optics arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical beam steering enables optical detection and imaging in macroscopic or microscopic scales and long-range communication over free space. It underpins numerous optical applications, including LiDAR, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing. Despite the inherent speed of light, advanced applications increasingly require the ability to steer multiple beams simultaneously to increase imaging throughput, boost communication bandwidth, and control arrays qubits for scalable quantum computing. Therefore, there is a significant demand for non-mechanical, integrated, and scalable multi-beam steering technology. Here, we report a scalable multi-beam steering system comprising an array of acousto-optic beam steering channels and photonic integrated circuits on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. Each channel generates tens of individually controllable beams of visible wavelength by exciting acoustic waves using digitally synthesized multi-tone microwave signals. We demonstrate the system's capabilities through multi-input, multi-output free-space communications, simultaneously transmitting to multiple receivers at megabits/sec data rates. This technology can be readily scaled up to steer hundreds of optical beams from a compact chip, potentially advancing many areas of optical technologies and enabling novel applications.</description>

      <title>Intense X-ray Vortices Generation via Wavefront Shaping in high-gain Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The x-ray vortex optical beam, distinguished by its topological charge and orbital angular momentum, offers new insights in probing complex electronic structures, enhancing material characterization, and advancing high-resolution imaging techniques. Here we propose a straightforward and effective method to generate intense x-ray vortices with tunable wavelengths in high-gain free-electron lasers (FELs). By simply adjusting the wavefront tilt of the radiation pulse during the FEL gain process, high-quality vortex beam can be amplified until saturation. Compared to existing methods for FEL vortex generation, the proposed technique imposes no wavelength limitations and can be easily implemented in high-gain FEL facilities, regardless of the operation modes.</description>

      <title>Broadband measurement of Feibelman's quantum surface response functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feibelman $d$-parameter, a mesoscopic complement to the local bulk permittivity, describes quantum optical surface responses for interfaces, including nonlocality, spill-in and-out, and surface-enabled Landau damping. It has been incorporated into the macroscopic Maxwellian framework for convenient modeling and understanding of nanoscale electromagnetic phenomena, calling for the compilation of a $d$-parameter database for interfaces of interest in nano-optics. However, accurate first-principles calculations of $d$-parameters face computational challenges, whereas existing measurements of $d$-parameters are scarce and restricted to narrow spectral windows. We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure $d$-parameters at a gold--air interface across the visible--ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill in and spill out at different frequencies. We also observe gold's Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the $d$-parameter, around 2.5 eV. Our measurements give rise to and are further validated by the passivity and Kramers--Kronig causality analysis of $d$-parameters. Our work advances the understanding of quantum surface response and may enable applications like enhanced electron field emission.</description>

      <title>Small-scale light structures in a Kerr medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a monochromatic weakly nonlinear light wave in a Kerr medium, a system of equations is suggested which up to the third order in magnitude of the electric field is equivalent to the known equation $\mbox{curl}\,\mbox{curl}\, {\bf E}=k_0^2[{\bf E +\alpha |{\bf E}|^2}{\bf E}+\beta({\bf E}\cdot{\bf E}){\bf E}^*]$, but the new equations are much more convenient for numerical computation. Within this system, optical fields with small structures, just as two or three wavelengths, are simulated. It is found that in some parametric domain, a stable self-focused light beam (a 2D vector soliton) is possible, and no modification of the nonlinearity is required for that. ``Non-elastic'' collisions of two such narrow beams with opposite circular polarizatios are computed. Besides that, for the defocusing nonlinearity, examples are given which demonstrate interacting optical vortices, spatial separation of the circular polarizations, and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.</description>

      <title>Carrier-envelope-phase-independent field sampling of single-cycle transients using Homochromatic Attosecond Streaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of Homochromatic Attosecond Streaking (HAS) has enabled a novel, highly precise method for ultrafast metrology of attosecond electron pulses as well as for real-time sampling of the instantaneous field waveforms of light transients. Here, we evaluate the potential of HAS as a method for precisely sampling the field waveform of non-phase-stabilized, single-cycle transients of light. We show that the extreme nonlinearity of field emission allows our technique to isolate and track the waveform of a single carrier-envelope phase (CEP) setting whose field dynamics results in the most energetic electron cutoff. Our results establish HAS as a robust, compact, all-solid-state method for characterizing light fields with attosecond-level precision and as a powerful tool in light field synthesis.</description>

      <title>Optothermal Revolution: Colloids in an Optical Ring Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional motion is commonly observed in various living active systems, such as bacterial colonies moving through confined environments. In these systems, the dynamics arise from the collective effects of mutual interactions between individual elements, as well as their interactions with obstacles or boundaries. In this study, we turn our focus to an artificial system and experimentally investigate the emergence of directional revolution in dimer and trimer structures composed of colloidal particles in ring-shaped optical illumination. In this case, the movement of these colloidal structures is exclusively facilitated by optothermal interactions without any direct mechanical force applied from the external optical field. Depending on the optical absorption properties of the colloidal particles, these optothermal interactions can exhibit both attractive and repulsive characteristics. The attractive interactions provide the necessary driving force that propels the motion, while the repulsive interactions serve to control the structural parameters of the system. The arrangement and interaction of the colloidal particles within these dimer and trimer structures fuel the controlled, directional revolution, with the optical gradient force acting as a confining factor, guiding the movement along a specific path. Notably, the dynamics of these systems can be tuned by altering the intensity of the optical field. This study can be useful as a model for understanding insights into biological systems where group dynamics and environmental interactions are key to coordinated movement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multijunction active layers, featuring a stack of alternating active layers and tunnel junctions, to PCSELs to increase their slope efficiency, which is vital for various applications including laser processing and LiDAR. First, we design a multijunction PCSEL that avoids optical absorption in the heavily-doped tunnel junctions while allowing sufficient optical gain and resonance effects in the active and photonic crystal layers. Next, we fabricate a 3-mm-diameter two-junction PCSEL, achieving a slope efficiency of 1.58 W/A, which is over twice as high as that of conventional single-junction PCSELs, and a record-high peak output power of 1.8 kW for PCSELs.</description>

      <title>Design and Fabrication of Robust Hybrid Photonic Crystal Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneously integrated hybrid photonic crystal cavities enable strong light-matter interactions with solid-state, optically addressable quantum memories. A key challenge to realizing high quality factor (Q) hybrid photonic crystals is the reduced index contrast on the substrate compared to suspended devices in air. This challenge is particularly acute for color centers in diamond because of diamond's high refractive index, which leads to increased scattering loss into the substrate. Here we develop a design methodology for hybrid photonic crystals utilizing a detailed understanding of substrate-mediated loss, which incorporates sensitivity to fabrication errors as a critical parameter. Using this methodology we design robust, high-Q, GaAs-on-diamond photonic crystal cavities, and by optimizing our fabrication procedure we experimentally realize cavities with Q approaching 30,000 at a resonance wavelength of 955 nm.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Photonics-based D-band Integrated Localization and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Terahertz spectrum has the ability to provide high-speed communication and millimeter-level resolution. As a result, terahertz-integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been identified as a key enabler for 6G wireless networks. This work discusses a photonics-based D-band communication system for integrated high-resolution localization and high-speed wireless communication. Our empirical results show that a communication rate of 5 Gbps over a distance of 1.5 meters and location identification of the target with millimeter-level (&lt;3 mm) range resolution can be conducted simutaneously. We also show that the error due to the thickness of the beam splitter can be eliminated, while the quantization error and the random drift errors are the limiting factors of the resolution achieved. This experimental demonstration using D-band communication indicates that terahertz ISAC can be realized for 6G networks while considering the underlying system restrictions, e.g. bandwidth limit and lens diameter.</description>

      <title>Tailored 3D microphantoms: an essential tool for quantitative phase tomography analysis of organoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for benchmarking and validating quantitative phase tomography (QPT) systems using three-dimensional microphantoms. These microphantoms, crafted from biological and imaging data, replicate the optical and structural properties of multicellular biological samples. Their fabrication featuring refractive index modulation at sub-micrometer details is enabled by two-photon polymerization. We showcase the effectiveness of our technique via a round-robin test of healthy and tumoral liver organoid phantoms across three different QPT systems. This test reveals sample- and system-dependent errors in measuring dry mass and morphology. Tailored microphantoms establish the gold standard for the optimization of hardware setups, reconstruction strategies and error assessment, paving the way for novel non-invasive, label-free measurements of 3D biological samples.</description>

      <title>Free-standing bilayer metasurfaces in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mult-layered meta-optics have enabled complex wavefront shaping beyond their single layer counterpart owing to the additional design variables afforded by each plane. For instance, complex amplitude modulation, generalized polarization transformations, and wide field of view are key attributes that fundamentally require multi-plane wavefront matching. Nevertheless, existing embodiments of bilayer metasurfaces have relied on configurations which suffer from Fresnel reflections, low mode confinement, or undesired resonances which compromise the intended response. Here, we introduce bilayer metasurfaces made of free-standing meta-atoms working in the visible spectrum. We demonstrate their use in wavefront shaping of linearly polarized light using pure geometric phase with diffraction efficiency of 80 % expanding previous literature on Pancharatnam-Berry phase metasurfaces which rely on circularly or elliptically polarized illumination. The fabrication relies on a two-step lithography and selective development processes which yield free standing, bilayer stacked metasurfaces, of 1200 nm total thickness. The metasurfaces comprise TiO2 nanofins with vertical side walls. Our work advances the nanofabrication of compound meta-optics and inspires new directions in wavefront shaping, metasurface integration, and polarization control.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal scintillation using one-dimensional magneto-optical photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillation describes the conversion of high-energy particles into light in transparent media and finds diverse applications such as high-energy particle detection and industrial and medical imaging. This process operates on multiple timescales, with the final radiative step consisting of spontaneous emission, which can be modeled within the framework of quasi-equilibrium fluctuational electrodynamics. Scintillation can therefore be controlled and enhanced via nanophotonic effects, which has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Such designs have thus far obeyed Lorentz reciprocity, meaning there is a direct equivalence between scintillation emission and absorption by the scintillator. However, scintillators that do not obey Lorentz reciprocity have not been explored, even though they represent a novel platform for probing emission which is both nonequilibrium and nonreciprocal in nature. In this work, we propose to harness nonreciprocity to achieve directional control of scintillation emission, granting an additional degree of control over scintillation. Such directionality of light output is important in improving collection efficiencies along the directions where detectors are located. We present the design of a nonreciprocal scintillator using a one-dimensional magnetophotonic crystal in the Voigt configuration. Our work demonstrates the potential of controlling nonequilibrium emission such as scintillation by breaking reciprocity and expands the space of nanophotonic design for achieving such control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coherent concatenation of multiple Townes solitons may lead to a stable infrared and visible broadband filament in ceramic YAG polycrystal. This self-trapped soliton train helps implement self-referenced multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging. Simulations and experiments are presented in this work that help enhance the understanding of the filamentation process and the concatenation of focusing-defocusing cycles in Ceramic and Crystal YAG. Simulations and experiments are presented that examine the dependence of the filamentation onset location and supercontinuum generation upon peak input power. Understanding this dependence is a necessary component of SR-M-CARS implementation.</description>

      <title>Amplifying hybrid entangled states and superpositions of coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare two amplification schemes, photon addition and then subtraction ($\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger$) and successive photon addition ($\hat{a}^\dagger{}^2$), applied to hybrid entangled states (HESs) and superpositions of coherent states (SCSs). We show that the amplification schemes' fidelity and gain for HESs are the same as those of coherent states. On the other hand, SCSs show quite nontrivial behaviors by the amplification schemes, depending on the amplitudes of coherent states, number of coherent-state components, and relative phases between the components. This implies that appropriate amplification schemes for SCSs should be chosen depending on the tasks and specific forms of the states. To investigate the quality of amplified states, we calculate the quantum Fisher information, a measure of quantum phase estimation. In terms of the quantum Fisher information, the $\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger$ scheme tends to show better performance for relatively small amplitudes while the $\hat{a}^\dagger{}^2$ scheme is better in larger amplitude regime. The performance of the two schemes becomes indistinguishable as the amplitude grows sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Rapid Prototyping of 3D Microstructures: A Simplified Grayscale Lithography Encoding Method Using Blender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The democratization of fabrication equipment has spurred recent interest in maskless grayscale lithography for both 2D and 3D microfabrication. However, the design of suitable template images remains a challenge. This work presents a simplified method for encoding 3D objects into grayscale image files optimized for grayscale lithography. Leveraging the widely used, open-source 3D modeling software Blender, we developed a robust approach to convert geometric heights into grayscale levels and generate image files through top-view rendering. Our method accurately reproduced the overall shape of simple structures like stairs and ramps compared to the original designs. We extended this approach to complex 3D sinusoidal surfaces, achieving similar results. Given the increasing accessibility and user-friendliness of digital rendering tools, this study offers a promising strategy for rapid prototyping of initial designs with minimal effort.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluids of Light in 2D Artificial Reconfigurable Aperiodic Crystals with Tailored Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aperiodic crystals are the intermediates between strictly periodic crystalline matter and amorphous solids. The lack of translational symmetry combined with intrinsic long-range order endows aperiodic crystals with unique physical characteristics, while at the same time dramatically enriching the spectrum and localization properties. Here, we demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in a two-dimensional Penrose tiling with $C_{10}$ rotational symmetry - the first signature of quasicrystalline order in a quantum fluid of light. We identify a regime, wherein near-perfect delocalization and synchronization of a quantum fluid of light occurs at mesoscopic length-scales extending beyond 100x the healing length and the size of each individual condensate. Realizing long-range order in fully reconfigurable aperiodic crystals of nonlinear, and open-dissipative quantum fluids, lays the foundations for testing a broad range of universality classes of continuous phase transitions beyond the limits of mathematically verifiable models in regular lattices.</description>

      <title>Accurate Zernike-Corrected Phase Screens for Arbitrary Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave propagation through random continuous media remains an important fundamental problem with applications ranging from remote sensing to quantum communication. Typically, such media are characterized by smooth refractive index fluctuations whose impact on the wave can be captured by the stochastic parabolic equation. The latter can be solved numerically by means of a split-step method, which replaces the continuous medium with a number of discrete phase screens derived from the medium's power spectrum. We introduce and benchmark highly accurate and efficient hybrid phase screens for arbitrary power spectra which are based on the combination of Zernike and Fourier phase screens.</description>

      <title>Surface-near domain engineering in multi-domain x-cut lithium niobate tantalate mixed crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium niobate and lithium tantalate are among the most widespread materials for nonlinear, integrated photonics. Mixed crystals with arbitrary Nb-Ta ratios provide a new degree of freedom to tune materials properties, such as the birefringence, but also leverage the advantages of the singular compounds, for example, by combining the thermal stability of lithium tantalate with the larger nonlinear or piezoelectric constants of lithium niobate. Periodic poling is the prerequisite for any nonlinear optical application. For mixed crystals this has been challenging so far due to the lack of homogeneous, mono-domain crystals, which severely inhibit domain growth and nucleation. In this work we demonstrate that surface-near ($&lt; 1$~$\mu$m depth) periodic poling on x-cut lithium niobate tantalate mixed crystals can be achieved via electric field poling and lithographically structured electrodes. We find that naturally occurring head-to-head or tail-to-tail domain walls in the as-grown crystal inhibit domain inversion at a larger scale. However, periodic poling is possible, if the gap size between the poling electrodes is of the same order of magnitude or smaller than the average size of naturally occurring domains. This work provides the basis for the nonlinear optical application of lithium niobate tantalate mixed crystals.</description>

      <title>Selective Passive Tuning of Cavity Resonance by Mode Index Engineering of the Partial Length of a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavities in large-scale photonic integrated circuits often suffer from a wider distribution of resonance frequencies due to fabrication errors. It is crucial to adjust the resonances of cavities using post-processing methods to minimize the frequency distribution. We have developed a concept of passive tuning by manipulating the mode index of a portion of a microring cavity. Through analytical studies and numerical experiments, we have found that depositing a thin film of dielectric material on top of the cavity or etching the material enables us to fine-tune the resonances and minimize the frequency distribution. This versatile method allows for the selective tuning of each cavity's resonance in a large set of cavities in a single fabrication step, providing robust passive tuning in large-scale photonic integrated circuits. We show that proposed method achieves tuning resolution below 1/Q and range upto 10^3/Q for visible to near-infrared wavelengths. Furthermore, this method can be applied and explored in various optical cavities and material configurations.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Multimode Fiber Imaging and Characterization Under Thermal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimode fiber (MMF) imaging aided by machine learning holds promise for numerous applications, including medical endoscopy. A key challenge for this technology is the sensitivity of modal transmission characteristics to environmental perturbations. Here, we show experimentally that an MMF imaging scheme based on a neural network (NN) can achieve results that are significantly robust to thermal perturbations. For example, natural images are successfully reconstructed as the MMF's temperature is varied by up to 50$^{\circ}$C relative to the training scenario, despite substantial variations in the speckle patterns caused by thermal changes. A dense NN with a single hidden layer is found to outperform a convolutional NN suitable for standard computer vision tasks. In addition, we demonstrate that NN parameters can be used to understand the MMF properties by reconstructing the approximate transmission matrices, and we show that the image reconstruction accuracy is directly related to the temperature dependence of the MMF's transmission characteristics.</description>

      <title>Surface Second Harmonic Generation from Topological Dirac Semimetal PdTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments and calculations in topological semimetals have observed anomalously strong second-order optical nonlinearity, but yet whether the enhancement also occurs at surfaces of topological semimetals in general remains an open question. In this work, we tackle this problem by measuring polarization-dependent and rotational-anisotropy optical second harmonic generation (SHG) from centrosymmetric type-II Dirac semimetal PdTe$_2$. We found the SHG to follow C$_{3v}$ surface symmetry with a time-varying intensity dictated by the oxidation kinetics of the material after its surface cleavage, indicating the surface origin of SHG. Quantitative characterization of the surface nonlinear susceptibility indicates a large out-of-plane response of PdTe$_2$ with $|\chi_{ccc}^{(2)}|$ up to 25 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ m$^2$/V. Our results support the topological surfaces/interfaces as a new route toward applications of nonlinear optical effects with released symmetry constraints, and demonstrate SHG as a viable means to in situ study of kinetics of topological surfaces.</description>

      <title>Gated InAs quantum dots embedded in surface acoustic wave cavities for low-noise optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) are promising optomechanical elements due to their excellent photonic properties and sensitivity to local strain fields. Microwave-frequency modulation of photons scattered from these efficient quantum emitters has been recently demonstrated using surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavities. However, for optimal performance, a gate structure is required to deterministically control the charge state and reduce charge noise of the QDs. Here, we integrate gated QDs and SAW cavities using molecular beam epitaxy and nanofabrication. We demonstrate that with careful design of the substrate layer structure, integration of the two systems can be accomplished while retaining the optimal performance of each subsystem. These results mark a critical step toward efficient and low-noise optomechanical systems for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction.</description>

      <title>Topological photon pumping in quantum optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems with long-range couplings and apply it to the transport of a photon in quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all couplings. By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological pumping and theoretically and numerically demonstrate topologically protected and dispersionless transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples, we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Ryd\-berg atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states, and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9\%. Moreover, we find that the photon pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the coupling parameters.</description>
