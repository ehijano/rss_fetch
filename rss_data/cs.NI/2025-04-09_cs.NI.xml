      <title>Scalable Routing in a City-Scale Wi-Fi Network for Disaster Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new city-scale decentralized mesh network system suited for disaster recovery and emergencies. When wide-area connectivity is unavailable or significantly degraded, our system, MapMesh, enables static access points and mobile devices equipped with Wi-Fi in a city to route packets via each other for intra-city connectivity and to/from any nodes that might have Internet access, e.g., via satellite. The chief contribution of our work is a new routing protocol that scales to millions of nodes, a significant improvement over prior work on wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc networks. Our approach uses detailed information about buildings from widely available maps--data that was unavailable at scale over a decade ago, but is widely available now--to compute paths in a scalable way.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing by Space-Time Waveform Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the task of introducing a new wireless data link over a given occupied frequency band using a multi-antenna transmitter and receiver. We design formally a dynamic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless link that can coexist in the fixed congested frequency band by (a) optimally avoiding sensed interference in the joint space-time domain, and (b) protecting existing links by minimizing its own transmitted power in the band. In particular, the transmit beam weight vector and time domain pulse code sequence are jointly optimized to minimize the transmit energy per bit per antenna, while maintaining a pre-defined signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the joint space-time maximum SINR receiver filter. Extensive numerical studies are carried out to demonstrate the derived algorithmic solution in light and heavily congested band scenarios with non-cooperative co-channel links. We show that the proposed autonomously reconfigurable 4x4 MIMO link outperforms a non-adaptive transceiver and other forms of waveform shaping in terms of the pre-detection SINR performance and the capability to protect ongoing non-cooperative links by not occupying the band with redundant transmissions.</description>

      <title>SigChord: Sniffing Wide Non-sparse Multiband Signals for Terrestrial and Non-terrestrial Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While unencrypted information inspection in physical layer (e.g., open headers) can provide deep insights for optimizing wireless networks, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods heavily depend on full sampling rate (a.k.a Nyquist rate), and high-cost radios, due to terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks densely occupying multiple bands across large bandwidth (e.g., from 4G/5G at 0.4-7 GHz to LEO satellite at 4-40 GHz). To this end, we present SigChord, an efficient physical layer inspection system built on low-cost and sub-Nyquist sampling radios. We first design a deep and rule-based interleaving algorithm based on Transformer network to perform spectrum sensing and signal recovery under sub-Nyquist sampling rate, and second, cascade protocol identifier and decoder based on Transformer neural networks to help physical layer packets analysis. We implement SigChord using software-defined radio platforms, and extensively evaluate it on over-the-air terrestrial and non-terrestrial wireless signals. The experiments demonstrate that SigChord delivers over 99% accuracy in detecting and decoding, while still decreasing 34% sampling rate, compared with the SOTA approaches.</description>

      <title>Bridging Research and Standardization: Innovations and Methodology for 6G Standard Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition towards 6G presents unique challenges and opportunities in mobile networks design and standardization. Addressing these challenges requires a robust methodology for analyzing and selecting innovations that can be effectively translated into 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) contributions. This paper presents a systematic approach to bridging research and standardization, ensuring that cutting-edge advancements extend beyond academia and translate into concrete standardization efforts. The proposed methodology has been applied within the Italian RESTART framework to two ongoing research areas: Morphable Programmable Networks (MPNs) and Network Digital Twins (NDTs), both key enablers of next-generation networks. MPNs enhance dynamic adaptability and resource management, while NDTs enable real-time simulation, predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-making. Their integration into 3GPP Release 20 will be instrumental in shaping a flexible and future-proof mobile ecosystem. These innovations exemplify how research-driven solutions can align with 6G standardization objectives. By applying the proposed methodology, we aim to establish a systematic pathway for transitioning research into impactful 3GPP contributions, ultimately driving the evolution of next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Optimization and Transfer Learning for Cellular Network Antenna Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach for large-scale cellular network optimization, using a production cellular network in London as a case study and employing Sionna ray tracing for site-specific channel propagation modeling. We optimize base station antenna tilts and half-power beamwidths, resulting in more than double the 10\%-worst user rates compared to a 3GPP baseline. In scenarios involving aerial users, we identify configurations that increase their median rates fivefold without compromising ground user performance. We further demonstrate the efficacy of model generalization through transfer learning, leveraging available data from a scenario source to predict the optimal solution for a scenario target within a similar number of iterations, without requiring a new initial dataset, and with a negligible performance loss.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Design of 3GPP Handover Parameters with Bayesian Optimization and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobility management in dense cellular networks is challenging due to varying user speeds and deployment conditions. Traditional 3GPP handover (HO) schemes, relying on fixed A3-offset and time-to-trigger (TTT) parameters, struggle to balance radio link failures (RLFs) and ping-pongs. We propose a data-driven HO optimization framework based on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO) and enhanced with transfer learning to reduce training time and improve generalization across different user speeds. Evaluations on a real-world deployment show that HD-BO outperforms 3GPP set-1 and set-5 benchmarks, while transfer learning enables rapid adaptation without loss in performance. This highlights the potential of data-driven, site-specific mobility management in large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Cellular Network Design for UAV Corridors via Data-driven High-dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of designing cellular networks for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) corridors through a novel data-driven approach. We assess multiple state-of-the-art high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO) techniques to jointly optimize the cell antenna tilts and half-power beamwidth (HPBW). We find that some of these approaches achieve over 20dB gains in median SINR along UAV corridors, with negligible degradation to ground user performance. Furthermore, we explore the HD-BO's capabilities in terms of model generalization via transfer learning, where data from a previously observed scenario source is leveraged to predict the optimal solution for a new scenario target. We provide examples of scenarios where such transfer learning is successful and others where it fails. Moreover, we demonstrate that HD-BO enables multi-objective optimization, identifying optimal design trade-offs between data rates on the ground versus UAV coverage reliability. We observe that aiming to provide UAV coverage across the entire sky can lower the rates for ground users compared to setups specifically optimized for UAV corridors. Finally, we validate our approach through a case study in a real-world cellular network, where HD-BO identifies optimal and non-obvious antenna configurations that result in more than double the rates along 3D UAV corridors with negligible ground performance loss.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Relative Representations for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In future 6G wireless networks, semantic and effectiveness aspects of communications will play a fundamental role, incorporating meaning and relevance into transmissions. However, obstacles arise when devices employ diverse languages, logic, or internal representations, leading to semantic mismatches that might jeopardize understanding. In latent space communication, this challenge manifests as misalignment within high-dimensional representations where deep neural networks encode data. This paper presents a novel framework for goal-oriented semantic communication, leveraging relative representations to mitigate semantic mismatches via latent space alignment. We propose a dynamic optimization strategy that adapts relative representations, communication parameters, and computation resources for energy-efficient, low-latency, goal-oriented semantic communications. Numerical results demonstrate our methodology's effectiveness in mitigating mismatches among devices, while optimizing energy consumption, delay, and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Content Caching with Waiting Costs via Restless Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18627v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an end user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they continuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a subset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache which either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh version or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh version. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV) dependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and making a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the optimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision epoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based policy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize the Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also compare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy and substantially outperforms the exising policies.</description>
