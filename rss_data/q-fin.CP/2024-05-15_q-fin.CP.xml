      <title>Cost-Benefit Analysis using Modular Dynamic Fault Tree Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulations for Condition-based Maintenance of Unmanned Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in condition-based maintenance (CBM) have helped make it a promising approach to maintenance cost avoidance in engineering systems. By performing maintenance based on conditions of the component with regards to failure or time, there is potential to avoid the large costs of system shutdown and maintenance delays. However, CBM requires a large investment cost compared to other available maintenance strategies. The investment cost is required for research, development, and implementation. Despite the potential to avoid significant maintenance costs, the large investment cost of CBM makes decision makers hesitant to implement. This study is the first in the literature that attempts to address the problem of conducting a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for implementing CBM concepts for unmanned systems. This paper proposes a method for conducting a CBA to determine the return on investment (ROI) of potential CBM strategies. The CBA seeks to compare different CBM strategies based on the differences in the various maintenance requirements associated with maintaining a multi-component, unmanned system. The proposed method uses modular dynamic fault tree analysis (MDFTA) with Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) to assess the various maintenance requirements. The proposed method is demonstrated on an unmanned surface vessel (USV) example taken from the literature that consists of 5 subsystems and 71 components. Following this USV example, it is found that selecting different combinations of components for a CBM strategy can have a significant impact on maintenance requirements and ROI by impacting cost avoidances and investment costs.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Networks Applied to Synthetic Financial Scenarios Generation</title>

Abstract: The finance industry is producing an increasing amount of datasets that investment professionals can consider to be influential on the price of financial assets. These datasets were initially mainly limited to exchange data, namely price, capitalization and volume. Their coverage has now considerably expanded to include, for example, macroeconomic data, supply and demand of commodities, balance sheet data and more recently extra-financial data such as ESG scores. This broadening of the factors retained as influential constitutes a serious challenge for statistical modeling. Indeed, the instability of the correlations between these factors makes it practically impossible to identify the joint laws needed to construct scenarios. Fortunately, spectacular advances in Deep Learning field in recent years have given rise to GANs. GANs are a type of generative machine learning models that produce new data samples with the same characteristics as a training data distribution in an unsupervised way, avoiding data assumptions and human induced biases. In this work, we are exploring the use of GANs for synthetic financial scenarios generation. This pilot study is the result of a collaboration between Fujitsu and Advestis and it will be followed by a thorough exploration of the use cases that can benefit from the proposed solution. We propose a GANs-based algorithm that allows the replication of multivariate data representing several properties (including, but not limited to, price, market capitalization, ESG score, controversy score,. . .) of a set of stocks. This approach differs from examples in the financial literature, which are mainly focused on the reproduction of temporal asset price scenarios. We also propose several metrics to evaluate the quality of the data generated by the GANs. This approach is well fit for the generation of scenarios, the time direction simply arising as a subsequent (eventually conditioned) generation of data points drawn from the learned distribution. Our method will allow to simulate high dimensional scenarios (compared to $\lesssim10$ features currently employed in most recent use cases) where network complexity is reduced thanks to a wisely performed feature engineering and selection. Complete results will be presented in a forthcoming study.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time algorithm for optimal stopping with fixed accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.02227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of high-dimensional path-dependent optimal stopping (OS) is important to multiple academic communities and applications. Modern OS tasks often have a large number of decision epochs, and complicated non-Markovian dynamics, making them especially challenging. Standard approaches, often relying on ADP, duality, deep learning and other heuristics, have shown strong empirical performance, yet have limited rigorous guarantees (which may scale exponentially in the problem parameters and/or require previous knowledge of basis functions or additional continuity assumptions). Although past work has placed these problems in the framework of computational complexity and polynomial-time approximability, those analyses were limited to simple one-dimensional problems. For long-horizon complex OS problems, is a polynomial time solution even theoretically possible? We prove that given access to an efficient simulator of the underlying information process, and fixed accuracy epsilon, there exists an algorithm that returns an epsilon-optimal solution (both stopping policies and approximate optimal values) with computational complexity scaling polynomially in the time horizon and underlying dimension. Like the first polynomial-time (approximation) algorithms for several other well-studied problems, our theoretical guarantees are polynomial yet impractical. Our approach is based on a novel expansion for the optimal value which may be of independent interest.</description>
