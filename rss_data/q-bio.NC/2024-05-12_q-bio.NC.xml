      <title>Contribution of Coincidence Detection to Speech Segregation in Noisy Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a biologically-inspired model designed to examine the role of coincidence detection cells in speech segregation tasks. The model consists of three stages: a time-domain cochlear model that generates instantaneous rates of auditory nerve fibers, coincidence detection cells that amplify neural activity synchronously with speech presence, and an optimal spectro-temporal speech presence estimator. A comparative analysis between speech estimation based on the firing rates of auditory nerve fibers and those of coincidence detection cells indicates that the neural representation of coincidence cells significantly reduces noise components, resulting in a more distinguishable representation of speech in noise. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of brainstem nuclei processing in enhancing auditory skills. Moreover, this approach can be further tested in other sensory systems in general and within the auditory system in particular.</description>

      <title>Combined topological and spatial constraints are required to capture the structure of neural connectomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric brain reconstructions provide an unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into the complex connectivity patterns of neurons in an increasing number of organisms. Here, we model and quantify the complexity of the resulting neural connectomes in the fruit fly, mouse, and human and unveil a simple set of shared organizing principles across these organisms. To put the connectomes in a physical context, we also construct contactomes, the network of neurons in physical contact in each organism. With these, we establish that physical constraints -- either given by pairwise distances or the contactome -- play a crucial role in shaping the network structure. For example, neuron positions are highly optimal in terms of distance from their neighbors. However, spatial constraints alone cannot capture the network topology, including the broad degree distribution. Conversely, the degree sequence alone is insufficient to recover the spatial structure. We resolve this apparent conflict by formulating scalable maximum entropy models, incorporating both types of constraints. The resulting generative models have predictive power beyond the input data, as they capture several additional biological and network characteristics, like synaptic weights and graphlet statistics.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Language and Human Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If language evolved by sexual selection to display superior intelligence, then we require conversational skills, to impress other people, gain high social status, and get a mate. Conversational skills include a Theory of Mind, a sense of self, self esteem and social emotions. To be impressive, we must converse fluently and fast. The syntax of an utterance is defined by fast unification of feature structures. The pragmatic skills of conversation are also learned and deployed as feature structures; we rehearse conversations as verbal thoughts. Many aspects of our mental lives (such as our Theory of Mind, and our social emotions) work by fast, pre conscious unification of learned feature structures, rather than rational deliberation. As we think, we use the Fast Theory of Mind to infer (unreliably) how a Shadow Audience will regard what we think, say, and do. These forces, which determine our motivations and actions, are less rational and deliberate than we like to suppose</description>

      <title>Advantageous and disadvantageous inequality aversion can be taught through vicarious learning of others' preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While enforcing egalitarian social norms is critical for human society, punishing social norm violators often incurs a cost to the self. This cost looms even larger when one can benefit from an unequal distribution of resources (i.e. advantageous inequity), as in receiving a higher salary than a colleague with the identical role. In the Ultimatum Game, a classic test bed for fairness norm enforcement, individuals rarely reject (punish) such unequal proposed divisions of resources because doing so entails a sacrifice of one's own benefit. Recent work has demonstrated that observing another's punitive responses to unfairness can efficiently alter the punitive preferences of an observer. It remains an open question, however, whether such contagion is powerful enough to impart advantageous inequity aversion to individuals. Using a variant of the Ultimatum Game in which participants are tasked with responding to fairness violations on behalf of another 'Teacher' - whose aversion to advantageous (versus disadvantageous) inequity was systematically manipulated-we probe whether individuals subsequently increase their punishment unfair after experiencing fairness violations on their own behalf. In two experiments, we found individuals can acquire aversion to advantageous inequity 'vicariously' through observing (and implementing) the Teacher's preferences. Computationally, these learning effects were best characterized by a model which learns the latent structure of the Teacher's preferences, rather than a simple Reinforcement Learning account. In summary, our study is the first to demonstrate that people can swiftly and readily acquire another's preferences for advantageous inequity, suggesting in turn that behavioral contagion may be one promising mechanism through which social norm enforcement - which people rarely implement in the case of advantageous inequality - can be enhanced.</description>

      <title>The Building Blocks of Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consciousness is presented not as a unified and uniquely human characteristic, but rather as an emergent property of several building blocks, most of which are demonstrably present in other species. Each block has its own rationale under natural selection and could have arisen independently, and the jumps between blocks -- which culminate in consciousness -- are small enough to be evolutionarily plausible. One underappreciated block involves unconscious engram playback and discrimination, and plays a major role in brain storage optimization. This function is present in birds and nearly all mammals and is recognized by its side-effect: dreams.</description>

      <title>ACTION: Augmentation and Computation Toolbox for Brain Network Analysis with Functional MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been increasingly employed to investigate functional brain activity. Many fMRI-related software/toolboxes have been developed, providing specialized algorithms for fMRI analysis. However, existing toolboxes seldom consider fMRI data augmentation, which is quite useful, especially in studies with limited or imbalanced data. Moreover, current studies usually focus on analyzing fMRI using conventional machine learning models that rely on human-engineered fMRI features, without investigating deep learning models that can automatically learn data-driven fMRI representations. In this work, we develop an open-source toolbox, called Augmentation and Computation Toolbox for braIn netwOrk aNalysis (ACTION), offering comprehensive functions to streamline fMRI analysis. The ACTION is a Python-based and cross-platform toolbox with graphical user-friendly interfaces. It enables automatic fMRI augmentation, covering blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal augmentation and brain network augmentation. Many popular methods for brain network construction and network feature extraction are included. In particular, it supports constructing deep learning models, which leverage large-scale auxiliary unlabeled data (3,800+ resting-state fMRI scans) for model pretraining to enhance model performance for downstream tasks. To facilitate multi-site fMRI studies, it is also equipped with several popular federated learning strategies. Furthermore, it enables users to design and test custom algorithms through scripting, greatly improving its utility and extensibility. We demonstrate the effectiveness and user-friendliness of ACTION on real fMRI data and present the experimental results. The software, along with its source code and manual, can be accessed online.</description>
