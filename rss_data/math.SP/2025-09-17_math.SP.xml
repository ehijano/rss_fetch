      <title>Spectra of random graphs with discrete scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random graphs defined by an occurrence probability that is invariant under node aggregation have been identified recently in the context of network renormalization. The invariance property requires that edges are drawn with a specific probability that, in the annealed case, depends on a necessarily infinite-mean node fitness. The diverging mean determines many properties that are uncommon in models with independent edges, but at the same time widespread in real-world networks. Here we focus on the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the model, where the n nodes are assigned a Pareto($\alpha$)-distributed fitness with 0 &lt; $\alpha$ &lt; 1. We find that the leading eigenvalues are all of order square root of n, alternate in sign and are located at the intersection between the real axis and a logarithmic spiral in the complex plane, which we characterize analytically in terms of the Gamma function. We also calculate the associated eigenvectors, finding that they display complexvalued scaling exponents and log-periodicity, which are signatures of discrete scale invariance. In contrast with the typical finite-rank behaviour of random graphs with finite-mean variables, we find that a growing number of the leading eigenvalues emerges from the bulk, whose edge extends up to order square root of n and therefore reaches the same scale as that of the structural eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>On Courant-type bounds and spectral partitioning via Neumann domains on quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on quantum graphs, with a particular focus on Morse eigenfunctions via nodal and Neumann domains. Building on Courant-type arguments, we establish upper bounds for the number of nodal points and explore conditions under which Neumann domains of eigenfunctions correspond to minimizers to a class of spectral partition problems often known as spectral minimal partitions. The main focus will be the analysis on tree graphs, where we characterize the spectral energies of such partitions and relate them to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian under genericity assumptions. Notably, we introduce a notion analogous to Courant-sharpness for Neumann counts and demonstrate when spectral minimal partitions coincide with partitions formed by Neumann domains of eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Topological Levinson's theorem and corrections at thresholds: the full picture in a quasi-1D example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various threshold effects are investigated on a discrete quasi-1D scattering system. In particular, one of these effects is to add corrections to Levinson's theorem. We explain how these corrections are due to the opening or to the closing of channels of scattering, and how these contributions can be computed as partial winding numbers on newly introduced operators. Embedded thresholds, thresholds associated with changes of spectral multiplicity, and doubly degenerate thresholds are exhibited and analyzed. Most of the investigations are of an analytical nature, but the final equalities rely on a C*-algebraic framework.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of random perturbations of non-normal Toeplitz matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral properties of Toeplitz operators and their finite truncations have long been central in operator theory. In the finite dimensional, non-normal setting, the spectrum is notoriously unstable under perturbations. Random perturbations provide a natural framework for studying this instability and identifying spectral features that emerge in typical noisy situations. This article surveys recent advances on the spectral behavior of (polynomially vanishing) random perturbations of Toeplitz matrices, focusing mostly on the limiting spectral distribution, the distribution of outliers, and localization of eigenvectors, and highlight the major techniques used to study these problems. We complement the survey with new results on the limiting spectral distribution of polynomially vanishing random perturbation of Toeplitz matrices with continuous symbols, on the limiting spectral distribution of finitely banded Toeplitz matrices under exponentially and super-exponentially vanishing random perturbations, and on the complete localization of outlier eigenvectors of randomly perturbed Jordan blocks.</description>
