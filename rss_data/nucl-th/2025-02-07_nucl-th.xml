      <title>Emulators for scarce and noisy data II: Application to auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo for neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of pure neutron matter is necessary for interpreting multi-messenger observations of neutron stars. Reliable data analyses of these observations require well-quantified uncertainties for the EOS input, ideally propagating uncertainties from nuclear interactions directly to the EOS. This, however, requires calculations of the EOS for a prohibitively larger number of nuclear Hamiltonians, solving the nuclear many-body problem for each one. Quantum Monte Carlo methods, such as Auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), provide precise and accurate results for the neutron matter EOS but they are very computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for the fast evaluations necessary for uncertainty propagation. Here, we employ parametric matrix models to develop fast emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter, and use them to directly propagate uncertainties of coupling constants in the Hamiltonian to the EOS. As these uncertainties include estimates of the EFT truncation uncertainty, this approach provides robust uncertainty estimates for use in astrophysical data analyses. This work will enable novel applications such as using astrophysical observations to put constraints on coupling constants for nuclear interactions.</description>

      <title>Radii of light nuclei from the Jacobi No-Core Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining the size of the atomic nucleus with realistic nuclear forces is a long outstanding issue of nuclear physics. The no-core shell model (NCSM), one of the powerful ab initio methods for nuclear structure, can achieve accurate energies of light nuclei. The extraction of converged radii is more difficult. In this work, we present a novel method to effectively extract the radius of light nuclei by restoring the long-range behavior of densities from NCSM calculations. The correct large distance asymptotic of two-body relative densities are deduced based on the NCSM densities in limited basis size. The resulting radii using the corrected densities show a nice convergence. The root-mean-square matter and charge radii of $^{4,6,8}$He and $^{6,7,8}$Li can be accurately obtained based on Jacobi-NCSM calculations with the high-precision chiral two-nucleon and three-nucleon forces combined with this new method. Our method can be straightforwardly extended to other ab initio calculations, potentially providing a better description of nuclear sizes with realistic nuclear forces.</description>

      <title>Three-body structures of low-lying nuclear states of $^8$Li</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four nucleons in $^8$Li outside the $\alpha$-particle ($\alpha=^4$He) can be divided into pairs of one neutron ($n$) and 3 nucleons in the triton ($t=^3$H), or 2 in the deuteron ($d=^2$H) and two neutrons in a dineutron ($^2n$). The corresponding three-body structures, $\alpha$+$t$+$n$ or $\alpha$+$d$+$^2n$, are suggested to describe the bulk part of the low-energy ($&lt;10$~MeV) states of $^8$Li. Several breakup thresholds influence the structures and possible decays. We calculate the three-body structures of the various $J^{\pi}$ states, where different clustering appear, e.g. $^7$Li*+$n$, $^6$Li*$+^2n$, $^6$He*$+d$. The experimental $^8$Li spectrum can be reproduced with fine tuning by a three-body potential parameter. Three unobserved $0^+$ and an excited 2$^+$ states are found. All states appear as bound states or resonances. The lowest or highest energies have cluster structures, $\alpha$+$t$+$n$ or $\alpha$+$d$+$^2n$, respectively. We give calculated energy and width (if possible), geometry, and partial wave decomposition for all states.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limits of nucleonic metamodelling using different relativistic density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore two classes of density dependent relativistic mean-field models, their predictions of proton fractions at high densities and neutron star structure. We have used a metamodelling approach to these relativistic density functionals. We have generated a large ensemble of models with these classes and then applied constraints from theoretical and experimental nuclear physics and astrophysical observations. We find that both models produce similar equations of state and neutron star mass-radius sequences. But, their underlying compositions, denoted by the proton fraction in this case, are vastly different. This reinstates previous findings that information on composition gets masqueraded in $\beta$-equilibrium. Additional observations of non-equilibrium phenomena are necessary to pin it down.</description>

      <title>Multidisciplinary Science in the Multimessenger Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the chemical and kinetic nonequilibrium dynamics of the Higgs boson during the primordial Universe QGP (quark-gluon plasma) epoch $130\mathrm{\,GeV}&gt;T&gt;10\mathrm{\,GeV}$. We show that the Higgs bosons is always out of chemical abundance equilibrium with a fugacity $\Upsilon_h = 0.69$ due to virtual decay channels. Additionally, Higgs momentum distribution is found to be ``cold'' for $T&lt;40$\,GeV, since the scattering rate drops below the production rate.</description>

      <title>First-order CP phase transition in two-flavor QCD at $\theta = \pi$ under electromagnetic scale anomaly via a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the thermal CP phase transition in QCD at $\theta=\pi$ under a weak magnetic field background, where the electromagnetic scale anomaly gets significant. To explicitize, we work on a two-flavor Polyakov-loop Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at $\theta=\pi$ in the mean field approximation, including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly term. We find that the thermal CP phase transition becomes first order and the strength of the first order gets more prominent as the magnetic field increases. The associated potential barrier is thermally created by the electromagnetic scale anomaly and gives rise to criticality due to the induced potential of a non-perturbative form $\sim \frac{|eB|^3}{f_\pi} \frac{|P|}{P^2 + m_0^2}$, where $eB$ denotes the magnetic field strength; $P$ the CP order parameter, and $m_0$ the isospin-symmetric current-quark mass. The CP-broken deconfinement(-like) domain, $T^{\rm (CP)}_c &gt; T^{\rm (dec)}_{\rm pc}$, gets wider as $eB$ increases.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group invariant mean-field model for QCD at finite isospin density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potentials has phenomenological relevance for a series of physical systems and provides an ideal testground for the modeling of dense strongly interacting matter. The two-flavor quark-meson model is known to effectively describe the condensation of charged pions in QCD that occurs in this setting. In this paper, we work out a renormalization-group invariant mean-field formulation of the model and demonstrate that the resulting phase diagram and equation of state is in quantitative agreement with data from lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Absence of CP Violation in the Strong Interaction: Vacuum thwarts Axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD admits a contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which potentially gives rise to nontrivial phases and violates CP. This is essentially a question of how the vacuum reacts to the $\theta$ term. In this talk I will address the problem using new developments on the lattice. The overall solution is contrasted with the axion `solution'.</description>

      <title>Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin Transformations in Quantum Electrodynamics: For Perturbation Theory and Dynamical Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out a comprehensive analysis of the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations for a charged fermion propagator at the two-loop level in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Starting with an arbitrary covariant gauge $\xi$ and space-time dimension $d$, we provide its explicit expressions in three and four-dimensional QED. We begin with the tree-level fermion propagator in the Landau gauge and gauge-transform it to obtain an analytical expression for an all order result in an arbitrary covariant gauge. We expand it out to two-loops both for the massless and massive propagators in three and four space-time dimensions. In addition to comparing with all earlier results in the literature wherever possible, we also study constraints of multiplicative renormalizabilty of our results in four-dimensional QED which are logarithmically divergent. Finally, we analyze representative solutions of the fermion propagator which correspond to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation in QED. We study the gauge dependence of these emergent solutions, that of the Euclidean pole mass and the chiral fermion condensate.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Oscillation Modes in Neutron Stars with Hyperons and Delta Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a new parameterization of the modified effective chiral model, developed primarily to regulate the density content of the symmetry energy and its higher order terms, equations of state (EoSs) for hyperon-rich matter ($H$) and delta baryon matter ($\Delta$) were obtained. The models were used to investigate the emission of gravitational waves (GWs) through $f$-mode oscillations in the corresponding neutron stars. We obtained the stellar structure, $f$-mode frequency and tidal deformability $\Lambda$ for our models. We report that the $\Delta$ EoS is stiffer compared to the $H$ EoS. We also analyzed the velocity of sound in these media. The corresponding mass--radius relationships were obtained and compared with various observations. We studied the dependence of $f$-mode frequencies on the stellar mass, redshift and tidal deformability. We employed the well known Cowling approximation to obtain the $f$-mode frequencies for $l=2,\,3$ and $4$ modes of oscillation. We found that the $f$-mode frequencies of the $H$ and $\Delta$ EoSs were almost the same in the lower mass region, while we observed a substantial difference between them in the high-mass region. We also obtained an empirical relation for the EoSs considered. The various attributes obtained for our models showed close agreement with various observational constraints from pulsars and GW events.</description>

      <title>Polaronic neutron in dilute alpha matter: A $p$-wave Bose polaron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate quasiparticle properties of a neutron immersed in an alpha condensate, which is one of the possible states of dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The resonant $p$-wave neutron-alpha scattering, which plays a crucial role in forming halo nuclei, is considered. This system is similar to a Bose polaron near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance that can be realized in cold-atomic experiments. Calculating the self-energy within the field-theoretical approach, we give an analytical formula for the effective mass of a polaronic neutron as a function of alpha condensation density. Moreover, two adjacent neutrons in a medium, each of which behaves like a stable polaron having an enhanced effective mass, can form a bound dineutron, with the help of $^1S_0$ neutron-neutron attraction. This is in contrast to the case of the vacuum, where a dineutron is known to be unbound. Our result would be useful for understanding many-body physics in astrophysical environments as well as the formation of multi-nucleon clusters in neutron-halo nuclei.</description>

      <title>Precision big bang nucleosynthesis with improved Helium-4 predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.08023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial nucleosynthesis is one of the three historical evidences for the big bang model, together with the expansion of the universe and the cosmic microwave background. Now that the number of neutrino families and the baryonic densities have been fixed by laboratory measurements or CMB observations, the model has no free parameter and its predictions are rigid. Departure from its predictions could provide hints or constraints on new physics or astrophysics in the early universe. Precision on primordial abundances deduced from observations have recently been drastically improved and reach the percent level for both deuterium and helium-4. Accordingly, the BBN predictions should reach the same level of precision. For most isotopes, the dominant sources of uncertainty come from those on the laboratory thermonuclear reactions. This article focuses on helium-4 whose predicted primordial abundance depends essentially on weak interactions which control the neutron-proton ratio. The rates of the various weak interaction processes depend on the experimentally measured neutron lifetime, but also includes numerous corrections that we thoroughly investigate here. They are the radiative, zero-temperature, corrections, finite nucleon mass corrections, finite temperature radiative corrections, weak-magnetism, and QED plasma effects, which are for the first time all included and calculated in a self consistent way, allowing to take into account the correlations between them, and verifying that all satisfy detailed balance. The helium-4 predicted mass fraction is $0.24709\pm0.00017$. In addition, we provide a Mathematica code (PRIMAT) that incorporates, not only these corrections but also a full network of reactions, using the best available thermonuclear reaction rates, allowing the predictions of primordial abundances up to the CNO region.</description>

Abstract: While dynamical tides only become relevant during the last couple of orbits for circular inspirals, orbital eccentricity can increase their impact during earlier phases of the inspiral by exciting tidal oscillations at each close encounter. We investigate the effect of dynamical tides on the orbital evolution of eccentric neutron star binaries using post-Newtonian numerical simulations and construct an analytic stochastic model that reproduces the numerical results. Our study reveals a strong dependence of dynamical tides on the pericenter distance, with the fractional energy transferred to dynamical tides over that dissipated in gravitational waves (GWs) exceeding $\sim1\%$ at separations $r_\mathrm{p}\lesssim50$ km for large eccentricities. We demonstrate that the effect of dynamical tides on orbital evolution can manifest as a phase shift in the GW signal. We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the GW phase shift can reach the detectability threshold of $8$ with a single aLIGO detector at design densitivity for eccentric neutron star binaries at a distance of $40$ Mpc. This requires a pericenter distance of $r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim68$ km ($r_\mathrm{p0}\lesssim76$ km) at binary formation with eccentricity close to $1$ for a reasonable tidal deformability and f-mode frequency of $500$ and $1.73$ kHz ($700$ and $1.61$ kHz), respectively. The observation of the phase shift will enable measuring the f-mode frequency of neutron stars independently from their tidal deformability, providing significant insights into neutron star seismology and the properties of the equation of state. We also explore the potential of distinguishing between equal-radius and twin-star binaries, which could provide an opportunity to reveal strong first-order phase transitions in the nuclear equation of state.</description>

Abstract: We extend our measurement of the equation of state of isospin asymmetric QCD to small baryon and strangeness chemical potentials, using the leading order Taylor expansion coefficients computed directly at non-zero isospin chemical potentials. Extrapolating the fully connected contributions to vanishing pion sources is particularly challenging, which we overcome by using information from isospin chemical potential derivatives evaluated numerically. Using the Taylor coefficients, we present, amongst others, first results for the equation of state along the electric charge chemical potential axis, which is potentially of relevance for the evolution of the early Universe at large lepton flavour asymmetries.</description>
