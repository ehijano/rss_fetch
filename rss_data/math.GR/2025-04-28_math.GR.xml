      <title>Decomposition of Borel graphs and cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a cohomological criterion for certain decomposition of Borel graphs, which is an analog of Dunwoody's work on accessibility of groups. As an application, we prove that a Borel graph $(X,G)$ with uniformly bounded degrees of cohomological dimension one is Lipschitz equivalent to a Borel acyclic graph on $X$. This gives a new proof of a result of Chen-Poulin-Tao-Tserunyan on Borel graphs with components quasi-isometric to trees.</description>

      <title>The subalgebras of the generalized special unitary algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the real subalgebras of the generalized special unitary algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2,1)$, a non-compact real form of the complex special linear algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$. Our approach combines Galois cohomology with the existing classification of complex subalgebras of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$. This work completes the classification of real subalgebras of the non-compact real forms of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{C})$, since those of $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\mathbb{R})$ have already been classified.</description>

      <title>Translation length formula for two-generated groups acting on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate translation length functions for two-generated groups acting by isometries on $\Lambda$-trees, where $\Lambda$ is a totally ordered Abelian group. In this context, we provide an explicit formula for the translation length of any element of the group, under some assumptions on the translation lengths of its generators and their products. Our approach is combinatorial and relies solely on the defining axioms of pseudo-lengths, which are precisely the translation length functions for actions on $\Lambda$-trees. Furthermore, we show that, under some natural conditions on four elements $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta \in \Lambda$, there exists a unique pseudo-length on the free group $F(a,b)$ assigning these values to $a$, $b$, $ab$, $ab^{-1}$, respectively.
  Applications include results on properly discontinuous actions, discrete and free groups of isometries, and a description of the translation length functions arising from free actions on $\Lambda$-trees, where $\Lambda$ is Archimedean. This description is related to the Culler--Vogtmann outer space.</description>

      <title>Supersolvable subgroups of order divisible by 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the structure of the finite non-solvable groups of order divisible by $3$ all whose maximal subgroups of order divisible by $3$ are supersolvable. Precisely, we demonstrate that if $G$ is a finite non-solvable group satisfying the above condition on maximal subgroups, then either $G$ is a $3'$-group or $G/{\bf O}_{3'}(G)$ is isomorphic to ${\rm PSL}_2(2^p)$ for an odd prime $p$, where ${\bf O}_{3'}(G)$ denotes the largest normal $3'$-subgroup of $G$. Furthermore, in the latter case, ${\bf O}_{3'}(G)$ is nilpotent and ${\bf O}_2(G)\leq {\bf Z}(G)$.</description>

      <title>Homogeneity in Coxeter groups and split crystallographic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that affine Coxeter groups, even hyperbolic Coxeter groups and one-ended hyperbolic Coxeter groups are homogeneous in the sense of model theory. More generally, we prove that many (Gromov) hyperbolic groups generated by torsion elements are homogeneous. In contrast, we construct split crystallographic groups that are not homogeneous, and hyperbolic (in fact, virtually free) Coxeter groups that are not homogeneous (or, to be more precise, not $\mathrm{EAE}$-homogeneous). We also prove that, on the other hand, irreducible split crystallographic groups and torsion-generated hyperbolic groups are almost homogeneous. Along the way, we give a new proof that affine Coxeter groups are profinitely rigid. We also introduce the notion of profinite homogeneity and prove that finitely generated abelian-by-finite groups are profinitely homogeneous if and only if they are homogenenous, thus deducing in particular that affine Coxeter groups are profinitely homogeneous, a result of independent interest in the profinite context.</description>

      <title>The $m$-partite digraphical representations of valency 3 of finite groups generated by two elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \ \ Let $G$ be a finite group and $m \geq 2$ an integer. An $m$-partite digraphical representation ($m$-PDR) of a group $G$ is a digraph $\Gamma = (V, E)$ satisfying the following properties:
  \item $\Gamma$ is regular;
  \item The automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ is isomorphic to $G$;
  \item $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ acts semiregularly on the vertex set $V$;
  \item The action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ partitions $V$ into exactly $m$ orbits, with each induced subgraph on an orbit being edgeless. This paper advances the classification program for $m$-PDRs with prescribed valency. Building on Du et al.'s complete classification of unrestricted $m$-PDRs \cite{du4} (2021), we focus on the unresolved valency-specific cases. For digraphs, the minimal nontrivial valencies are $k=2$ (even) and $k=3$ (odd), since a connected digraph of valency one is just a directed cycle. While Du et al. \cite{du3} recently classified valency 2 $m$-POSRs for groups generated by at most two elements - where $m$-POSRs are necessarily $m$-PDRs by definition - the valency 3 case remains open. Since all finite simple groups are two-generated, we investigate $m$-PDRs of valency 3 for groups generated by at most two elements, and establish a complete classification of nontrivial finite simple groups admitting $m$-PDRs of valency 3.</description>

      <title>Cayley hyper-digraphs and Cayley hypermaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09561v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Cayley hyper-digraph is a directed hypergraph that its automorphism group contains a subgroup acting regularly on vertices and a Cayley hypermap is a hypermap whose automorphism group contains a subgroup which induces regular action on the hypervertex set. In this paper, we study Cayley hyper-digraphs and construct Cayley hypermaps which have high level of symmetry. Our main goal is to present the general theory so as to make it clear to study Cayley hypermaps.</description>

      <title>Hall-Littlewood polynomials, affine Schubert series, and lattice enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce multivariate rational generating series called Hall-Littlewood-Schubert ($\mathsf{HLS}_n$) series. They are defined in terms of polynomials related to Hall-Littlewood polynomials and semistandard Young tableaux. We show that $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series provide solutions to a range of enumeration problems upon judicious substitutions of their variables. These include the problem to enumerate sublattices of a $p$-adic lattice according to the elementary divisor types of their intersections with the members of a complete flag of reference in the ambient lattice. This is an affine analog of the stratification of Grassmannians by Schubert varieties. Other substitutions of $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield new formulae for Hecke series and $p$-adic integrals associated with symplectic $p$-adic groups, and combinatorially defined quiver representation zeta functions. $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series are $q$-analogs of Hilbert series of Stanley-Reisner rings associated with posets arising from parabolic quotients of Coxeter groups of type $\mathsf{B}$ with the Bruhat order. Special values of coarsened $\mathsf{HLS}_n$ series yield analogs of the classical Littlewood identity for the generating functions of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>Averaging operators on groups and Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on groups were studied quite recently. Motivated mainly by the fact that weight zero Rota-Baxter operators and averaging operators are Koszul dual to each other, we propose the concepts of averaging group and averaging Hopf algebra, and study relationships among them and the existing averaging Lie algebras. We also show that an averaging group induces a disemigroup and a rack, respectively. As the free object is one of the most significant objects in a category, we also construct explicitly the free averaging group on a set.</description>
