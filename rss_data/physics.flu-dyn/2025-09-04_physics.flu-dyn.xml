      <title>Random field reconstruction of inhomogeneous turbulence. Part II: Numerical approximation and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel random field model for the reconstruction of inhomogeneous turbulence from characteristic flow quantities has been recently introduced and analyzed by the authors. This article concerns the numerical approximation and implementation of the model and discusses its key features by means of numerical simulations. We present an effective discretization scheme based on a randomized quadrature method for stochastic integrals. The convergence of the scheme is verified analytically and its algorithmic implementation is described in detail. Various numerical simulation results illustrate the influence of the macroscopically varying characteristic flow quantities on the inhomogeneous turbulence field and demonstrate its spatio-temporal ergodicity properties.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Aerodynamic Optimization of Ride Height and Rake Angle in a Sedan Car Using CFD and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic performance of an Audi A4 sedan using CFD analysis. A 3D model was developed in SolidWorks and validated against DrivAer Notchback wind-tunnel data, showing only a 3.25 percent deviation in drag coefficient (Cd). Ride height varied from 1.336 to 1.536 m and rake angle from 0 to 5 degrees, across four Reynolds numbers. Gradient Boosting emerged as the most accurate predictive model (R square = 0.97 for Cd and 0.96 for lift coefficient, Cl), outperforming Random Forest and LightGBM. Differential Evolution optimization was performed under balanced, drag-focused, and downforce-focused conditions. Reynolds number had minimal impact on optimum location; therefore, detailed results are reported for one Reynolds number, with other Re showing similar trends. The baseline geometry exhibited Cd = 0.313 and Cl = 0.0288. Balanced optimization achieved Cd = 0.287 and Cl = - 0.0826. Minimum drag condition reached Cd = 0.285 with slight positive lift (Cl = 0.0142), while maximum downforce optimization reached Cl = - 0.1084 with a 6.71 percent drag penalty (Cd = 0.334). Near-optimal solutions were found within ride heights of 1.341 to 1.365 m and rakes of 0.158 to 4.610 degrees, indicating robust aerodynamic performance. Machine learning predictions were further validated against CFD with a small error in Cd.</description>

      <title>Relaminarization of turbulent pipe flow induced by streamwise traveling wave wall transpiration and its scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In technical applications, more than 90\% of the energy required to pump the fluids through pipes is dissipated by turbulence near the wall. In this respect, streamwise traveling waves of wall blowing and suction have been used to relaminarize turbulent pipe flow at a low friction Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=110$, considerably reducing friction losses and energy consumption. Here, we demonstrate that streamwise traveling waves of wall blowing and suction applied to initially turbulent pipe flow can trigger relaminarization up to friction Reynolds numbers of $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=720$. Furthermore, we perform a parametric study comprising both upstream traveling waves (UTWs, $c&lt;0$) and downstream traveling waves (DTWs, $c&gt;0$) by varying the traveling wave amplitude $a$, celerity $c$, and wavelength $\lambda$ at $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=180$ and $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=360$ in order to investigate the scaling of the maximum drag reduction and of the net energy saving rate in direct numerical simulations. Consistent with channel flow studies in the literature, we found that UTWs destabilize the flow, while generating sublaminar drag due to the pumping effect. However, only low-speed UTWs with large amplitudes were discovered to decisively reduce energy consumption. For DTWs, a large range of wave parameters lead to a conspicuous drag reduction. Nevertheless, only a subgroup of these wave parameters are associated with siginificant net energy savings, i.e. $0.067U_{c,lam} \lesssim a \lesssim0.1U_{c,lam}$, $c \approx U_{c,lam}$, and $\lambda\approx 360\delta_\nu$, independent of the Reynolds number. Here, $U_{c,lam}=1/2\mathrm{Re}_\tau u_\tau$ is the centerline velocity of the corresponding laminar flow, and $\delta_\nu = \nu/u_\tau$ is the viscous length scale.</description>

      <title>Narwhals and their blessings: exact coherent structures of elastic turbulence in channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions of long, flexible polymer molecules are complex fluids that simultaneously exhibit fluid-like and solid-like behaviour. When subjected to external flows, dilute polymer solutions develop elastic turbulence - a unique chaotic flow state absent in Newtonian fluids such as water. Unlike turbulence in Newtonian fluids, elastic turbulence arises from polymer stretching and alignment in the flow, and can occur even at vanishing inertia. While experimental realisations of elastic turbulence are well documented, its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
  In this paper, we present a perspective on the transition to elastic turbulence in pressure-driven channel flows, drawing on recent computational work from our group. We outline our current understanding of the transition in both two and three spatial dimensions, centred on two key building blocks: (i) narwhals, exact coherent states of the flow, and (ii) blessings, spatio-temporal intermittent states made up of several localised narwhal solutions.
  This contribution is based on a talk given by one of us (A.M.) at the 2024 APS DFD meeting.</description>

      <title>Follow the curvature of viscoelastic stress: Insights into the steady arrowhead structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focusing on simulated dilute polymer solutions, this letter investigates the interactions between flow structures and organized polymer stress sheets for the steady arrowhead coherent structure in a two-dimensional periodic channel flow. Formulating the problem in a frame of reference moving with the arrowhead velocity, streamlines, which are also pathlines in this frame, enables the identification of two distinct topological regions linked to two stagnation points. The streamlines help connecting the spatial distribution of polymer stress within the sheets and the dynamics of polymers transported by the flow. Using stresslines, lines parallel to the eigenvectors of polymer stress, a novel formulation of the viscoelastic stress term in the momentum transport equation proposes a more intuitive interpretation of the relation between the curvature of the stresslines, and the variation of stress along these lines, with the local flow topology. An approximation of this formulation is shown to explain the pressure jump observed in the arrowhead structure as a function of the local curvature of the polymer stress sheet.</description>

      <title>Extreme dynamics and relaxation of quantum gases: A hydrodynamic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum gases, released from traps, are studied through hydrodynamics, both analytically and numerically, in one and two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of long time self-similar solutions of the Euler equations, for the density and velocity fields, and derive the scaling exponents as well as the scaling functions. We find that the expanding gas develops a shock front and the size of the cloud grows in time as a powerlaw. We relate the associated exponent to that appearing in the corresponding equation of state of the quantum gas. Furthermore, we study the relaxation dynamics of a trapped quantum gas and show that the resulting steady state is in excellent agreement with that derived analytically. Our hydrodynamic approach is versatile and can be used to unravel several other far-from-equilibrium collective phenomenon of extreme nature, relevant to the growing experimental interests in quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Surface bubble lifetime in the presence of a turbulent air flow, and the effect of surface layer renewal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface bubbles in the ocean are critical in moderating several fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the drainage and lifetime of surface bubbles in solutions containing surfactants and salts, subjected to turbulence in the air surrounding them modelling the wind above the ocean. We carefully construct a setup allowing us to repeatably measure the mean lifetime of a series of surface bubbles, while varying the solution and the wind speed or humidity of the air. To that end, we show that renewing the surface layer is critical to avoid a change of the physical properties of the interface. We show that the drainage of the bubbles is well modelled by taking into account the outwards viscous flow and convective evaporation. The mean lifetime of surface bubbles in solutions containing no salt is controlled by evaporation and independent on surfactant concentration. When salt is added, the same scaling is valid only at high surfactant concentrations. At low concentrations, the lifetime is always smaller and independent of wind speed, owing to the presence of impurities triggering a thick bursting event. When the mean lifetime is controlled by evaporation, the probability density of lifetime is very narrow around its mean, while when impurities are present, a broad distribution is observed.</description>

      <title>Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using results of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations, it is shown that cross-helicity can dominate power spectra of the magnetic field generated by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo in a chaotic/turbulent von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n flow and its numerical analogue (simulation). The theoretical consideration is based on a Kolmogorov-like phenomenology within the framework of the distributed chaos concept. The observations of the dynamics of the solar magnetic field (solar activity) have been briefly discussed in this context.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven droplet deformation at low Weber numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate droplet deformation following laser-pulse impact at low Weber numbers (We ~ 0.1-100). Droplet dynamics can be characterized by two key parameters: the impact We number and the width, W, of the distribution of the impact force over the droplet surface. By varying laser pulse energy, our experiments traverse a phase space comprising (I) droplet oscillation, (II) breakup, or (III) sheet formation. Numerical simulations complement the experiments by determining the pressure width and by allowing We and W to be varied independently, despite their correlation in the experiments. A single phase diagram, integrating observations from both experiments and simulations, demonstrates that all phenomena can be explained by a single parameter: the deformation Weber number Wed=f(We, W) that is based on the initial radial expansion speed of the droplet, following impact. The resulting phase diagram separates (I) droplet oscillation for Wed&lt;5, from (II) breakup for 5&lt;Wed&lt;60, and (III) sheet formation for Wed&gt;60.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dissipation via time-modulated velocity fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by mixing processes in analytical laboratories, this work investigates enhanced dissipation in non-autonomous flows. We study the evolution of concentrations governed by the advection-diffusion equation, where the velocity field is modelled as the product of a shear flow and a time-dependent modulation function $\xi(t)$. The main objective of this paper is to derive quantitative estimates for the energy decay rates, which are shown to depend sensitively on the properties of $\xi$. We identify a class of time-dependent functions that are bounded by increasing functions, for which we demonstrate super-enhanced dissipation, characterized by energy decay rates faster than those observed in autonomous cases. Additionally, we explore the case of velocity fields that may be switched on and off over time. Here, the dissipation rates are comparable to those of autonomous flows. To illustrate our results, we analyse two prototypical flows of this class: one exhibiting a gradual turn-on and turn-off phase, and another that undergoes a significant acceleration following a slow initial activation phase. Both results are achieved through the application of the hypocoercivity framework, adapted to an augmented functional with time-dependent weights. These weights are designed to dynamically counteract the potential growth of $\xi$, ensuring robust decay estimates.</description>

      <title>Equivariant U-Shaped Neural Operators for the Cahn-Hilliard Phase-Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation, plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries. Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics, achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.</description>
