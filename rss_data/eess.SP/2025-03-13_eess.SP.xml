      <title>Age of Positioning with Stochastic Motion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) is a key metric used for evaluating data freshness in communication networks, particularly in systems requiring real-time updates. In positioning applications, maintaining low AoI is critical for ensuring timely and accurate position estimation. This paper introduces an age-informed metric, which we term as Age of Positioning (AoP), that captures the temporal evolution of positioning accuracy for agents following random trajectories and sharing sporadic location updates. Using the widely adopted Random Waypoint (RWP) mobility model, which captures stochastic user movement through waypoint-based trajectories, we derive closed-form expressions for this metric under various queuing disciplines and different modes of operation of the agent. The analytical results are verified with numerical simulations, and the existence of optimal operating conditions is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Time-Frequency Synchronization in Distributed ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distributed integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC) system offers significant cooperative gains for both sensing and communication performance. These gains, however, can only be fully realized when the distributed nodes are perfectly synchronized, which is a challenge that remains largely unaddressed in current ISAC research. In this paper, we propose an over-the-air time-frequency synchronization framework for the D-ISAC system, leveraging the reciprocity of bistatic sensing channels. This approach overcomes the impractical dependency of traditional methods on a direct line-of-sight (LoS) link, enabling the estimation of time offset (TO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) between two ISAC nodes even in non-LoS (NLOS) scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce a bistatic signal matching (BSM) technique with delay-Doppler decoupling, which exploits offset reciprocity (OR) in bistatic observations. This method compresses multiple sensing links into a single offset for estimation. We further present off-grid super-resolution estimators for TO and CFO, including the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the matrix pencil (MP) method, combined with BSM processing. These estimators provide accurate offset estimation compared to spectral cross-correlation techniques. Also, we extend the pairwise synchronization leveraging OR between two nodes to the synchronization of $N$ multiple distributed nodes, referred to as centralized pairwise synchronization. We analyze the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for TO and CFO estimates and evaluate the impact of D-ISAC synchronization on the bottom-line target localization performance. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, confirm the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed synchronization approach can recover up to 96% of the bottom-line target localization performance of the fully-synchronous D-ISAC.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Neural 3D Reconstruction Under Pose Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing neural implicit surfaces for 3D reconstruction using acoustic images collected with drifting sensor poses. The accuracy of current state-of-the-art 3D acoustic modeling algorithms is highly dependent on accurate pose estimation; small errors in sensor pose can lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the neural scene representation and sonar poses. Our algorithm does so by parameterizing the 6DoF poses as learnable parameters and backpropagating gradients through the neural renderer and implicit representation. We validated our algorithm on both real and simulated datasets. It produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions even under significant pose drift.</description>

      <title>Beam Selection in ISAC using Contextual Bandit with Multi-modal Transformer and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) wireless technology is anticipated to introduce Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) as a transformative paradigm. ISAC unifies wireless communication and RADAR or other forms of sensing to optimize spectral and hardware resources. This paper presents a pioneering framework that leverages ISAC sensing data to enhance beam selection processes in complex indoor environments. By integrating multi-modal transformer models with a multi-agent contextual bandit algorithm, our approach utilizes ISAC sensing data to improve communication performance and achieves high spectral efficiency (SE). Specifically, the multi-modal transformer can capture inter-modal relationships, enhancing model generalization across diverse scenarios. Experimental evaluations on the DeepSense 6G dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, achieving superior beam prediction accuracy and adaptability. In the single-user scenario, we achieve an average SE regret improvement of 49.6% as compared to DRL. Furthermore, we employ transfer reinforcement learning to reduce training time and improve model performance in multi-user environments. In the multi-user scenario, this approach enhances the average SE regret, which is a measure to demonstrate how far the learned policy is from the optimal SE policy, by 19.7% compared to training from scratch, even when the latter is trained 100 times longer.</description>

      <title>Predicting Lifespan of Ground-to-Air Multipath Components in mmWave UAV Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mobile ground-to-air (GA) propagation channels, the birth and death of multipath components (MPCs) are frequently observed, and the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) assumption does not always hold. Several methods exist for tracking the birth and death of MPCs, however, to the best of knowledge of authors, there is no existing literature that addresses the prediction of the lifespan of the MPCs in nonWSSUS GA propagation channels. In this work, we consider the GA channel as non-WSSUS and individual MPCs across receiver positions are represented as time series based on the Euclidean distance between channel parameters of the MPCs. These time series representations, referred to as path bins, are analyzed using a semi-Markov chain model. The channel parameter variations and dependencies between path bins are used to predict the lifespan of path bins using weighted sum method, machine learning classifiers, and deep neural networks. For comparison, the birth and death of path bins are also modeled using a Poisson distribution and a Markov chain. Simulation results demonstrate that deep neural networks offer highly accurate predictions for the lifespan (including death) of MPC path bins in the considered GA propagation scenario.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) introduces new degrees of freedom (DoFs) for physical layer security (PLS) through pinching beamforming. In this paper, a couple of scenarios for secure beamforming for PASS are studied. 1) For the case with a single legitimate user (Bob) and a single eavesdropper (Eve), a closed-form expression for the optimal baseband beamformer is derived. On this basis, a gradient-based method is proposed to optimize the activated positions of pinching antennas (PAs). 2) For the case with multiple Bobs and multiple Eves, a fractional programming (FP)-based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, termed FP-BCD, is proposed for optimizing the weighted secrecy sum-rate (WSSR). Specifically, a closed-form baseband beamformer is obtained via Lagrange multiplier method. Furthermore, owing to the non-convex objective function exhibiting numerous stationary points, a low-complexity one-dimensional search is used to find a high-quality solution of the PAs' activated locations. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that: i) All proposed algorithms achieve stable convergence within a few iterations, ii) across all considered power ranges, the FP-BCD algorithm outperforms baseline methods using zero-forcing (ZF) and maximal-ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming in terms of the WSSR, and iii) PASS achieves a significantly higher secrecy rate than traditional fixed-antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and Self-Tuning SBL with Total Variation Priors for Block-Sparse Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter addresses the problem of estimating block sparse signal with unknown group partitions in a multiple measurement vector (MMV) setup. We propose a Bayesian framework by applying an adaptive total variation (TV) penalty on the hyper-parameter space of the sparse signal. The main contributions are two-fold. 1) We extend the TV penalty beyond the immediate neighbor, thus enabling better capture of the signal structure. 2) A dynamic framework is provided to learn the penalty parameter for regularization. It is based on the statistical dependencies between the entries of tentative blocks, thus eliminating the need for fine-tuning. The superior performance of the proposed method is empirically demonstrated by extensive computer simulations with the state-of-art benchmarks. The proposed solution exhibits both excellent performance and robustness against sparsity model mismatch.</description>

      <title>Performance Modeling for Correlation-based Neural Decoding of Auditory Attention to Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation-based auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit neural tracking mechanisms to determine listener attention among competing speech sources via, e.g., electroencephalography signals. The correlation coefficients between the decoded neural responses and encoded speech stimuli of the different speakers then serve as AAD decision variables. A critical trade-off exists between the temporal resolution (the decision window length used to compute these correlations) and the AAD accuracy. This trade-off is typically characterized by evaluating AAD accuracy across multiple window lengths, leading to the performance curve. We propose a novel method to model this trade-off curve using labeled correlations from only a single decision window length. Our approach models the (un)attended correlations with a normal distribution after applying the Fisher transformation, enabling accurate AAD accuracy prediction across different window lengths. We validate the method on two distinct AAD implementations: a linear decoder and the non-linear VLAAI deep neural network, evaluated on separate datasets. Results show consistently low modeling errors of approximately 2 percent points, with 94% of true accuracies falling within estimated 95%-confidence intervals. The proposed method enables efficient performance curve modeling without extensive multi-window length evaluation, facilitating practical applications in, e.g., performance tracking in neuro-steered hearing devices to continuously adapt the system parameters over time.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tensor-Aided Channel Estimation for Hardware Impaired Device Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09393v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the joint generalized channel estimation and device identification problem in Internet of Things (IoT) networks {under multipath propagation}. To fully utilize the received signal, we decompose the generalized channel into three components: transmitter hardware characteristics, path gains, and angles of arrival. By modelling the received signals as parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensors, we develop alternating least squares (ALS)-based algorithms to simultaneously estimate the generalized channels and identify the transmitters. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms {both Khatri-Rao Factorization (KRF) and the conventional least squares (LS) method} in terms of channel estimation accuracy and achieves performance close to the derived Cramer-Rao lower bound.</description>

      <title>Precoder Learning by Leveraging Unitary Equivariance Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating mathematical properties of a wireless policy to be learned into the design of deep neural networks (DNNs) is effective for enhancing learning efficiency. Multi-user precoding policy in multi-antenna system, which is the mapping from channel matrix to precoding matrix, possesses a permutation equivariance property, which has been harnessed to design the parameter sharing structure of the weight matrix of DNNs. In this paper, we study a stronger property than permutation equivariance, namely unitary equivariance, for precoder learning. We first show that a DNN with unitary equivariance designed by further introducing parameter sharing into a permutation equivariant DNN is unable to learn the optimal precoder. We proceed to develop a novel non-linear weighting process satisfying unitary equivariance and then construct a joint unitary and permutation equivariant DNN. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DNN not only outperforms existing learning methods in learning performance and generalizability but also reduces training complexity.</description>

      <title>Pulling Back Theorem for Generalizing the Diagonal Averaging Principle in Symplectic Geometry Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for analyzing time sequences. The SGMD is based on the upper conversion via embedding and down conversion via diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). However, there are two defects in the DAP: it just hold for the time delay $\tau=1$ in the trajectory matrix and it fails for the time sequence of type-1 with the form $X=\{x[n]\}^N_{n=1}$. In order to overcome these disadvantages, the inverse step for embedding is explored with binary Diophantine equation in number theory. The contributions of this work lie in three aspects: firstly, the pulling back theorem is proposed and proved, which state the general formula for converting the component of trajectory matrix to the component of time sequence for the general representation of time sequence and for any time delay $\tau\ge 1$; secondly a unified framework for decomposing both the deterministic and random time sequences into multiple modes is presented and explained; finally, the guidance of configuring the time delay is suggested, namely the time delay should be selected in a limited range via balancing the efficiency of matrix computation and accuracy of state estimation. It could be expected that the pulling back theorem will help the researchers and engineers to deepen the understanding of the theory and extend the applications of the SGMD and SSA in analyzing time sequences.</description>

      <title>Towards a robust R2D2 paradigm for radio-interferometric imaging: revisiting DNN training and architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture, improving its robustness in terms of generalisability beyond training conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty. Firstly, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we enhance the learning process by randomising Fourier sampling integration times, incorporating multi-scan multi-noise configurations, and varying imaging settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Secondly, we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the next DNN. Thirdly, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide activation, dense connections, weight normalisation, and low-rank convolution to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array (VLA) at fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality, data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>SIMAC: A Semantic-Driven Integrated Multimodal Sensing And Communication Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional single-modality sensing faces limitations in accuracy and capability, and its decoupled implementation with communication systems increases latency in bandwidth-constrained environments. Additionally, single-task-oriented sensing systems fail to address users' diverse demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose a semantic-driven integrated multimodal sensing and communication (SIMAC) framework. This framework leverages a joint source-channel coding architecture to achieve simultaneous sensing decoding and transmission of sensing results. Specifically, SIMAC first introduces a multimodal semantic fusion (MSF) network, which employs two extractors to extract semantic information from radar signals and images, respectively. MSF then applies cross-attention mechanisms to fuse these unimodal features and generate multimodal semantic representations. Secondly, we present a large language model (LLM)-based semantic encoder (LSE), where relevant communication parameters and multimodal semantics are mapped into a unified latent space and input to the LLM, enabling channel-adaptive semantic encoding. Thirdly, a task-oriented sensing semantic decoder (SSD) is proposed, in which different decoded heads are designed according to the specific needs of tasks. Simultaneously, a multi-task learning strategy is introduced to train the SIMAC framework, achieving diverse sensing services. Finally, experimental simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves diverse sensing services and higher accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Integrating BD-RIS into wireless communications systems has attracted significant interest due to its transformative potential in enhancing system performance. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of BD-RIS technology, examining its modeling, structural characteristics, and network integration while highlighting its advantages over traditional diagonal RIS. Specifically, we review various BD-RIS modeling approaches, including multiport network theory, graph theory, and matrix theory, and emphasize their application in diverse wireless scenarios. The survey also covers BD-RIS's structural diversity, including different scattering matrix types, transmission modes, intercell architectures, and circuit topologies, showing their flexibility in improving network performance.

      <title>Data-driven Nonlinear Modal Analysis with Physics-constrained Deep Learning: Numerical and Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To fully understand, analyze, and determine the behavior of dynamical systems, it is crucial to identify their intrinsic modal coordinates. In nonlinear dynamical systems, this task is challenging as the modal transformation based on the superposition principle that works well for linear systems is no longer applicable. To understand the nonlinear dynamics of a system, one of the main approaches is to use the framework of Nonlinear Normal Modes (NNMs) which attempts to provide an in-depth representation. In this research, we examine the effectiveness of NNMs in characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems. Given the difficulty of obtaining closed-form models or equations for these real-world systems, we present a data-driven framework that combines physics and deep learning to the nonlinear modal transformation function of NNMs from response data only. We assess the framework's ability to represent the system by analyzing its mode decomposition, reconstruction, and prediction accuracy using a nonlinear beam as an example. Initially, we perform numerical simulations on a nonlinear beam at different energy levels in both linear and nonlinear scenarios. Afterward, using experimental vibration data of a nonlinear beam, we isolate the first two NNMs. It is observed that the NNMs' frequency values increase as the excitation level of energy increases, and the configuration plots become more twisted (more nonlinear). In the experiment, the framework successfully decomposed the first two NNMs of the nonlinear beam using experimental free vibration data and captured the dynamics of the structure via prediction and reconstruction of some physical points of the beam.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Rydberg Atomic Receivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of the quantum technology presents huge opportunities for 6G communications. Leveraging the quantum properties of highly excited Rydberg atoms, Rydberg atom-based antennas present distinct advantages, such as high sensitivity, broad frequency range, and compact size, over traditional antennas. To realize efficient precoding, accurate channel state information is essential. However, due to the distinct characteristics of atomic receivers, traditional channel estimation algorithms developed for conventional receivers are no longer applicable. To this end, we propose a novel channel estimation algorithm based on projection gradient descent (PGD), which is applicable to both one-dimensional (1D) and twodimensional (2D) arrays. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation method.</description>

      <title>Phase-mismatched STAR-RIS with FAS-assisted RSMA Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers communication between a base station (BS) to two users, each from one side of a simultaneously transmitting-reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in the absence of a direct link. Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) strategy is employed and the STAR-RIS is subjected to phase errors. The users are equipped with a planar fluid antenna system (FAS) with position reconfigurability for spatial diversity. First, we derive the distribution of the equivalent channel gain at the FAS-equipped users, characterized by a t-distribution. We then obtain analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and average capacity (AC), with the latter obtained via a heuristic approach. Our findings highlight the potential of FAS to mitigate phase imperfections in STAR-RIS-assisted communications, significantly enhancing system performance compared to traditional antenna systems (TAS). Also, we quantify the impact of practical phase errors on system efficiency, emphasizing the importance of robust strategies for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Statistical Analysis of the DoF of Continuous Linear Arrays in the Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the number of communication modes, that is, the degrees of freedom (DoF), in a wireless setup comprising a small continuous linear intelligent antenna array in the near field of a large one. The framework allows for any orientations between the arrays and any positions in a two-dimensional space assuming that the transmitting array is placed at the origin. Therefore, apart from the length of the two continuous arrays, four key parameters determine the DoF and are hence considered in the analysis: the Cartesian coordinates of the center of the receiving array and two angles that model the rotation of each array around its center. The paper starts with the calculation of the deterministic DoF for a generic geometric setting, which extends beyond the widely studied paraxial case. Subsequently, a stochastic geometry framework is proposed to study the statistical DoF, as a first step towards the investigation of the system-level performance in near field networks. Numerical results applied to millimeter wave networks reveal the large number of DoF provided by near-field communications and unveiled key system-level insights.</description>

      <title>Optimal ISAC Beamforming Structure and Efficient Algorithms for Sum Rate and CRLB Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to unify wireless communications and radar sensing, enabling efficient spectrum and hardware utilization. A core challenge with realizing the gains of ISAC stems from the unique challenges of dual purpose beamforming design due to the highly non-convex nature of key performance metrics such as sum rate for communications and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity structured approach to ISAC beamforming optimization to simultaneously enhance spectral efficiency and estimation accuracy. Specifically, we develop a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm which transforms the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex subproblems ensuring convergence to a locally optimal solution. Furthermore, leveraging the proposed SCA framework and the Lagrange duality, we derive the optimal beamforming structure for CRLB optimization in ISAC systems. Our findings characterize the reduction in radar streams one can employ without affecting performance. This enables a dimensionality reduction that enhances computational efficiency. Numerical simulations validate that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance to the considered benchmarks while requiring much lower computational costs.</description>

      <title>GenHPE: Generative Counterfactuals for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Radio Frequency Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) detects the positions of human body joints for various applications. Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF) signals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the signal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus on single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot generalize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance. Specifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are entangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also intertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific confounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates counterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE trains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how human body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate skeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for generative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences between counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific confounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent representations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new subjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three public datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental results show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces estimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for cross-environment HPE.</description>

      <title>The R2D2 Deep Neural Network Series for Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09559v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Enhanced Resilient Design for MEC Offloading over Millimeter Wave Links</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.06361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merge of mobile edge computing (MEC) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications will hopefully enable the fast access for computational resources, where these two technologies can benefit from each other's potentials. However, the high susceptibility to blocking in mmWave networks imposes crucial challenges for further development of mmWave-MEC vision. In this paper, a novel intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted mmWave-MEC scheme is proposed to overcome the disruptive effect caused by blockage events. In this context, we investigate new methods to minimize mobile power for a multi-user mmWave-MEC system, thus efficiently orchestrating the uplink mobile power resources for latency-constrained computation offloading. In particular, the mobile power is optimized by joint design of individual device power, multi-user detection matrix and passive beamforming. To tackle this issue, we develop an alternating optimization framework so that the joint optimization can be decomposed into tractable subproblems. First, we provide closed-form expressions for the update of powers and multi-user detection vectors in each iteration step. Then, we reformulate the passive beamforming problem. To cater for large-scale IRS scenario, we propose two efficient algorithms including complex circle manifold optimization (CCMO) method and sum-of-inverse minimization (SIMin) fraction transform based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method. Finally, numerical results corroborate the merits of our proposed IRS assisted mmWave-MEC scheme, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose to employ reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for enhancing the D2D underlaying system performance. We study the joint power control, receive beamforming, and passive beamforming for RIS assisted D2D underlaying cellular communication systems, which is formulated as a sum rate maximization problem. To address this issue, we develop a block coordinate descent method where uplink power, receive beamformer and refection phase shifts are alternatively optimized. Then, we provide the closed-form solutions for both uplink power and receive beamformer. We further propose a quadratic transform based semi-definite relaxation algorithm to optimize the RIS phase shifts, where the original passive beamforming problem is translated into a separable quadratically constrained quadratic problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RIS assisted design significantly improves the sum-rate performance.</description>

Abstract: As an emerging trend in channel acquisition (CA), the concept of channel twinning (CT) has been proposed as a powerful enabler of ubiquitous connectivity in next-generation (xG) wireless systems. By fusing multimodal sensor data, CT advocates a high-fidelity and low-overhead CA paradigm, which is promising to provide accurate channel prediction in cross-domain and high-mobility scenarios of ubiquitous xG networks. However, existing literature lacks a universal CT architecture to address the challenges of heterogeneous scenarios, data, and resources in xG networks, which hinders the widespread deployment and applications of CT. This article discusses a new modularized CT architecture to bridge scene recognition, cooperative sensing, and decentralized training, comprising versatile model configuration, multimodal cooperative sensing, and lightweight twin modeling modules. Additionally, this article presents a detailed concept, technical features, and case studies of CT, outlines mainstream trends of realization methods, followed by potential applications of CT-empowered ubiquitous connectivity, and issues requiring future investigations.</description>

      <title>A Marginal Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter for Centralized Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State estimation is a fundamental problem for multi-sensor information fusion, essential in applications such as target tracking, power systems, and control automation. Previous research mostly ignores the correlation between sensors and assumes independent or known distributions. However, in practice, these distributions are often correlated and difAcult to estimate. This paper proposes a novel moment constrained marginal distributionally robust Kalman Alter (MC-MDRKF) for centralized state estimation in multi-sensor systems. First, we introduce a marginal distributional uncertainty set using a moment-constrained approach, which can better capture the uncertainties of Gaussian noises compared to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based methods. Based on that, a minimax optimization problem is formulated to identify the least favorable joint distribution and the optimal MMSE estimator thereunder. It is proved that this problem can be reformulated as a convex optimization problem, allowing for efficient solution Anding. Subsequently, by accounting for marginal distributional uncertainty within the state space model, the proposed MC-MDRKF is devised in a minimax approach. Simulation result demonstrates the robustness and superiority of the proposed method in a multi-sensor target tracking scenario.</description>

Abstract: Accurate RF propagation modeling in urban environments is critical for developing digital spectrum twins and optimizing wireless communication systems. We introduce OpenGERT, an open-source automated Geometry Extraction tool for Ray Tracing, which collects and processes terrain and building data from OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Global ML Building Footprints, and USGS elevation data. Using the Blender Python API, it creates detailed urban models for high-fidelity simulations with NVIDIA Sionna RT. We perform sensitivity analyses to examine how variations in building height, position, and electromagnetic material properties affect ray-tracing accuracy. Specifically, we present pairwise dispersion plots of channel statistics (path gain, mean excess delay, delay spread, link outage, and Rician K-factor) and investigate how their sensitivities change with distance from transmitters. We also visualize the variance of these statistics for selected transmitter locations to gain deeper insights. Our study covers Munich and Etoile scenes, each with 10 transmitter locations. For each location, we apply five types of perturbations: material, position, height, height-position, and all combined, with 50 perturbations each. Results show that small changes in permittivity and conductivity minimally affect channel statistics, whereas variations in building height and position significantly alter all statistics, even with noise standard deviations of 1 meter in height and 0.4 meters in position. These findings highlight the importance of precise environmental modeling for accurate propagation predictions, essential for digital spectrum twins and advanced communication networks. The code for geometry extraction and sensitivity analyses is available at github.com/serhatadik/OpenGERT/.</description>

Abstract: Cell-free (CF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) combines CF architecture with ISAC. CF employs distributed access points, eliminates cell boundaries, and enhances coverage, spectral efficiency, and reliability. ISAC unifies radar sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing within shared spectral and hardware resources. CF-ISAC leverages these strengths to improve spectral and energy efficiency while enhancing sensing in wireless networks. As a promising candidate for next-generation wireless systems, CF-ISAC supports robust multi-user communication, distributed multi-static sensing, and seamless resource optimization. However, a comprehensive survey on CF-ISAC has been lacking. This paper fills that gap by first revisiting CF and ISAC principles, covering cooperative transmission, radar cross-section, target parameter estimation, ISAC integration levels, sensing metrics, and applications. It then explores CF-ISAC systems, emphasizing their unique features and the benefits of multi-static sensing. State-of-the-art developments are categorized into performance analysis, resource allocation, security, and user/target-centric designs, offering a thorough literature review and case studies. Finally, the paper identifies key challenges such as synchronization, multi-target detection, interference management, and fronthaul capacity and latency. Emerging trends, including next-generation antenna technologies, network-assisted systems, near-field CF-ISAC, integration with other technologies, and machine learning approaches, are highlighted to outline the future trajectory of CF-ISAC research.</description>

Abstract: In this correspondence, we study deploying movable antenna (MA) array in a wideband multiple-input-single-output (MISO) communication system, where near-field (NF) channel model is considered. To alleviate beam squint effect, we propose to maximize the minimum analog beamforming gain across the entire wideband spectrum by appropriately adjusting MAs' positions, which is a highly challenging task. By introducing a slack variable and adopting the cutting-the-edge smoothed-gradient-descent-ascent (SGDA) method, we develop algorithms to resolve the aforementioned challenge. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the benefit of utilizing MA array to mitigate beam squint effect in NF wideband system.</description>

      <title>The inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions</title>

Abstract: The Monotonocity Principle (MP), stating a monotonic relationship between a material property and a proper corresponding boundary operator, is attracting great interest in the field of inverse problems, because of its fundamental role in developing real time imaging methods. Moreover, under quite general assumptions, a MP for elliptic PDEs with nonlinear coefficients has been established. This MP provided the basis for introducing a new imaging method to deal with the inverse obstacle problem, in the presence of nonlinear anomalies. This constitutes a relevant novelty because there is a general lack of quantitative and physic based imaging method, when nonlinearities are present. The introduction of a MP based imaging method poses a set of fundamental questions regarding the performance of the method in the presence of noise. The main contribution of this work is focused on theoretical aspects and consists in proving that (i) the imaging method is stable and robust with respect to the noise, (ii) the reconstruction approaches monotonically to a well-defined limit, as the noise level approaches to zero, and that (iii) the limit contains the unknown set and is contained in the outer boundary of the unknown set. Results (i) and (ii) come directly from the Monotonicity Principle, while results (iii) requires to prove the so-called Converse of the Monotonicity Principle, a theoretical sults of fundamental relevance to evaluate the ideal (noise-free) performances of the imaging method. The results are provided in a quite general setting for Calder\`on problem, and proved for three wide classes where the nonlinearity of the anomaly can be either bounded from infinity and zero, or bounded from zero only, or bounded by infinity only. These classes of constitutive relationships cover the wide majority of cases encountered in applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting Workload in Virtual Flight Simulations using EEG Features (Including Post-hoc Analysis in Appendix)</title>

Abstract: Effective cognitive workload management has a major impact on the safety and performance of pilots. Integrating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) presents an opportunity for real-time workload assessment. Leveraging cognitive workload data from high-fidelity virtual reality (VR) flight simulations allows for dynamic adjustments to training scenarios. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on EEG spectral power for workload prediction, delving into intra-brain connectivity may yield deeper insights. This study assessed the predictive value of EEG spectral and connectivity features in distinguishing high vs. low workload periods during simulated flight in VR and Desktop conditions. Using an ensemble approach, a stacked classifier was trained to predict workload from the EEG signals of 52 participants. Results showed that the mean accuracy of the model incorporating both spectral and connectivity features improved by 28% compared to the model that solely relied on spectral features. Further research on other connectivity metrics and deep learning models in a large sample of pilots is essential to validate the potential of a real-time workload-prediction BCI. This could contribute to the development of an adaptive training system for safety-critical operational environments.</description>

      <title>Data-driven tool wear prediction in milling, based on a process-integrated single-sensor approach</title>

Abstract: Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including transformer-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on two machines and on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving 99.1\% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Learned Recognizer with Customized RIS Phases and Sensing Durations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02244</link>

Abstract: Future wireless communication networks are expected to be smarter and more aware of their surroundings, enabling a wide range of context-aware applications. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are set to play a critical role in supporting various sensing tasks, such as target recognition. However, current methods typically use RIS configurations optimized once and applied over fixed sensing durations, limiting their ability to adapt to different targets and reducing sensing accuracy. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an advanced wireless communication system that multiplexes downlink signals for environmental sensing and introduces an intelligent recognizer powered by deep learning techniques. Specifically, we design a novel neural network based on the long short-term memory architecture and the physical channel model. This network iteratively captures and fuses information from previous measurements, adaptively customizing RIS phases to gather the most relevant information for the recognition task at subsequent moments. These configurations are dynamically adjusted according to scene, task, target, and quantization priors. Furthermore, the recognizer includes a decision-making module that dynamically allocates different sensing durations, determining whether to continue or terminate the sensing process based on the collected measurements. This approach maximizes resource utilization efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques while minimizing the impact on communication performance, even when sensing and communication occur simultaneously.
