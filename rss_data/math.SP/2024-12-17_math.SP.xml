      <title>Reflectionless operators and automorphic Herglotz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I am interested in canonical systems and Dirac operators that are reflectionless on an open set. In this situation, the half line $m$ functions are holomorphic continuations of each other and may be combined into a single function. By passing to the universal cover of its domain, we then obtain a one-to-one correspondence of these operators with Herglotz functions that are automorphic with respect to the Fuchsian group of covering transformations. I investigate the properties of this formalism, with particular emphasis given to the measures that are automorphic in a corresponding sense. This will shed light on the reflectionless operators as a topological space, on their extreme points, and on how the heavily studied smaller space of finite gap operators sits inside the (much) larger space.</description>

      <title>Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k spectrum for discrete systems: curves and their tangent lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k spectrum of a square matrix $A$ and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k curves emanating from the point $(\lambda,\lambda)$ with $\lambda$ being a real eigenvalue of $A$. We extend recent results by Maroncelli (2024) and remove his assumptions on symmetry of $A$ and simplicity of $\lambda$. We show that the number of Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k curves can significantly exceed the multiplicity of $\lambda$ and determine all the possible directions they can emanate in. We also treat the situation when the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda$ is greater than the geometric one and show that in such a case the Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k curves can loose their smoothness and provide the slopes of their "one-sided tangent lines". Finally, we offer two possible generalizations: the situation off the diagonal and Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k spectrum of a general Fredholm operator on the Hilbert space with a lattice structure.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra.
  These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formulas for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>An explicit spectral decomposition of the ADRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approximate discrete Radon transform (ADRT) is a hierarchical multiscale approximation of the Radon transform. In this paper, we factor the ADRT into a product of linear transforms that resemble convolutions, and derive an explicit spectral decomposition of each factor. We further show that this implies - for data lying in the range of the ADRT - that the transform of an $N \times N$ image can be formally inverted with complexity $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log^2 N)$. We numerically test the accuracy of the inverse on images of moderate sizes and find that it is competitive with existing iterative algorithms in this special regime.</description>

      <title>From resolvent expansions at zero to long time wave expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general abstract theorem deducing wave expansions as time goes to infinity from resolvent expansions as energy goes to zero, under an assumption of polynomial boundedness of the resolvent at high energy. We give applications to obstacle scattering, to Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonians, to scattering in a sector, and to scattering by a compactly supported potential.</description>
