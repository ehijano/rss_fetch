      <title>On a new PGDUS transformed model using Inverse Weibull distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Power Generalized DUS (PGDUS) Transformation is significant in reliability theory, especially for analyzing parallel systems. From the Generalized Extreme Value distribution, Inverse Weibull model particularly has wide applicability in statistics and reliability theory. In this paper we consider PGDUS transformation of Inverse Weibull distribution. The basic statistical characteristics of the new model are derived, and unknown parameters are estimated using Maximum likelihood and Maximum product of spacings methods. Simulation analysis and the reliability parameter P(T2 &lt; T1) are explored. The effectiveness of the model in fitting a real-world dataset is demonstrated, showing better performance compared to other competing distributions.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Archetypal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) was originally proposed in 1994 by Adele Cutler and Leo Breiman as a computational procedure to extract the distinct aspects called archetypes in observations with each observational record approximated as a mixture (i.e., convex combination) of these archetypes. AA thereby provides straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations. The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions concerning AA.</description>

      <title>A foundation for the distance sampling methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population size ("abundance") of wildlife species has central interest in ecological research and management. Distance sampling is a dominant approach to the estimation of wildlife abundance for many vertebrate animal species. One perceived advantage of distance sampling over the well-known alternative approach of capture-recapture is that distance sampling is thought to be robust to unmodelled heterogeneity in animal detection probability, via a conjecture known as "pooling robustness". Although distance sampling has been successfully applied and developed for decades, its statistical foundation is not complete: there are published proofs and arguments highlighting deficiency of the methodology. This work provides a design-based statistical foundation for distance sampling that has attainable assumptions. In addition, because identification and consistency of the developed distance sampling abundance estimator is unaffected by detection heterogeneity, the pooling robustness conjecture is resolved.</description>

      <title>Mean Independent Component Analysis for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the mean independent component analysis for multivariate time series to reduce the parameter space. In particular, we seek for a contemporaneous linear transformation that detects univariate mean independent components so that each component can be modeled separately. The mean independent component analysis is flexible in the sense that no parametric model or distributional assumptions are made. We propose a unified framework to estimate the mean independent components from a data with a fixed dimension or a diverging dimension. We estimate the mean independent components by the martingale difference divergence so that the mean dependence across components and across time is minimized. The approach is extended to the group mean independent component analysis by imposing a group structure on the mean independent components. We further introduce a method to identify the group structure when it is unknown. The consistency of both proposed methods are established. Extensive simulations and a real data illustration for community mobility is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Fair Conformal Prediction for Incomplete Covariate Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification. This study explores the application of conformal prediction in scenarios where covariates are missing, which introduces significant challenges for uncertainty quantification. We establish that marginal validity holds for imputed datasets across various mechanisms of missing data and most imputation methods. Building on the framework of nonexchangeable conformal prediction, we demonstrate that coverage guarantees depend on the mask. To address this, we propose a nonexchangeable conformal prediction method for missing covariates that satisfies both marginal and mask-conditional validity. However, as this method does not ensure asymptotic conditional validity, we further introduce a localized conformal prediction approach that employs a novel score function based on kernel smoothing. This method achieves marginal, mask-conditional, and asymptotic conditional validity under certain assumptions. Extensive simulation studies and real-data analysis demonstrate the advantages of these proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Density-Density Regression with Application to Cell-Cell Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a scalable framework for regressing multivariate distributions onto multivariate distributions, motivated by the application of inferring cell-cell communication from population-scale single-cell data. The observed data consist of pairs of multivariate distributions for ligands from one cell type and corresponding receptors from another. For each ordered pair $e=(l,r)$ of cell types $(l \neq r)$ and each sample $i = 1, \ldots, n$, we observe a pair of distributions $(F_{ei}, G_{ei})$ of gene expressions for ligands and receptors of cell types $l$ and $r$, respectively. The aim is to set up a regression of receptor distributions $G_{ei}$ given ligand distributions $F_{ei}$. A key challenge is that these distributions reside in distinct spaces of differing dimensions. We formulate the regression of multivariate densities on multivariate densities using a generalized Bayes framework with the sliced Wasserstein distance between fitted and observed distributions. Finally, we use inference under such regressions to define a directed graph for cell-cell communications.</description>

      <title>Cluster weighted models with multivariate skewed distributions for functional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a clustering method, funWeightClustSkew, based on mixtures of functional linear regression models and three skewed multivariate distributions: the variance-gamma distribution, the skew-t distribution, and the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution. Our approach follows the framework of the functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend to functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions used for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious models, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for simulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.</description>

      <title>Spatial Functional Deep Neural Network Model: A New Prediction Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of spatially dependent functional data is critical for various engineering and scientific applications. In this study, a spatial functional deep neural network model was developed with a novel non-linear modeling framework that seamlessly integrates spatial dependencies and functional predictors using deep learning techniques. The proposed model extends classical scalar-on-function regression by incorporating a spatial autoregressive component while leveraging functional deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear relationships. To ensure a robust estimation, the methodology employs an adaptive estimation approach, where the spatial dependence parameter was first inferred via maximum likelihood estimation, followed by non-linear functional regression using deep learning. The effectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and an application to Brazilian COVID-19 data, where the goal was to predict the average daily number of deaths. Comparative analysis with maximum likelihood-based spatial functional linear regression and functional deep neural network models demonstrates that the proposed algorithm significantly improves predictive performance. The results for the Brazilian COVID-19 data showed that while all models achieved similar mean squared error values over the training modeling phase, the proposed model achieved the lowest mean squared prediction error in the testing phase, indicating superior generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Analyzing multi-center randomized trials with covariate adjustment while accounting for clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) and G-computation with canonical generalized linear models have become increasingly popular for estimating the average treatment effect in randomized experiments. These estimators leverage outcome prediction models to adjust for imbalances in baseline covariates across treatment arms, improving statistical power compared to unadjusted analyses, while maintaining control over Type I error rates, even when the models are misspecified. Practical application of such estimators often overlooks the clustering present in multi-center clinical trials. Even when prediction models account for center effects, this neglect can degrade the coverage of confidence intervals, reduce the efficiency of the estimators, and complicate the interpretation of the corresponding estimands. These issues are particularly pronounced for estimators of counterfactual means, though less severe for those of the average treatment effect, as demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations and supported by theoretical insights. To address these challenges, we develop efficient estimators of counterfactual means and the average treatment effect in a random center. These extract information from baseline covariates by relying on outcome prediction models, but remain unbiased in large samples when these models are misspecified. We also introduce an accompanying inference framework inspired by random-effects meta-analysis and relevant for settings where data from many small centers are being analyzed. Adjusting for center effects yields substantial gains in efficiency, especially when treatment effect heterogeneity across centers is large. Monte Carlo simulations and application to the WASH Benefits Bangladesh study demonstrate adequate performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>High Dimensional Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis for Elliptical Symmetric Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust high-dimensional sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method for investigating linear relationships between two high-dimensional random vectors, focusing on elliptical symmetric distributions. Traditional CCA methods, based on sample covariance matrices, struggle in high-dimensional settings, particularly when data exhibit heavy-tailed distributions. To address this, we introduce the spatial-sign covariance matrix as a robust estimator, combined with a sparsity-inducing penalty to efficiently estimate canonical correlations. Theoretical analysis shows that our method is consistent and robust under mild conditions, converging at an optimal rate even in the presence of heavy tails. Simulation studies demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing sparse CCA methods, particularly under heavy-tailed distributions. A real-world application further confirms the method's robustness and efficiency in practice. Our work provides a novel solution for high-dimensional canonical correlation analysis, offering significant advantages over traditional methods in terms of both stability and performance.</description>

      <title>Covariate balancing estimation and model selection for difference-in-differences approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In causal inference, remarkable progress has been made in difference-in-differences (DID) approaches to estimate the average effect of treatment on the treated (ATT). Of these, the semiparametric DID (SDID) approach incorporates a propensity score analysis into the DID setup. Supposing that the ATT is a function of covariates, we estimate it by weighting the inverse of the propensity score. As one method to make the estimation robust to the propensity score modeling, we incorporate covariate balancing. Then, by attentively constructing the moment conditions used in the covariate balancing, we show that the proposed estimator has doubly robustness. In addition to the estimation, model selection is also addressed. In practice, covariate selection is an essential task in statistical analysis, but even in the basic setting of the SDID approach, there are no reasonable information criteria. Therefore, we derive a model selection criterion as an asymptotically bias-corrected estimator of risk based on the loss function used in the SDID estimation. As a result, we show that a penalty term is derived that is considerably different from almost twice the number of parameters that often appears in AIC-type information criteria. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method estimates the ATT robustly compared to the method using propensity scores given by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and that the proposed criterion clearly reduces the risk targeted in the SDID approach compared to the intuitive generalization of the existing information criterion. In addition, real data analysis confirms that there is a large difference between the results of the proposed method and the existing method.</description>

      <title>Spatial Confidence Regions for Excursion Sets with False Discovery Rate Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying areas where the signal is prominent is an important task in image analysis, with particular applications in brain mapping. In this work, we develop confidence regions for spatial excursion sets above and below a given level. We achieve this by treating the confidence procedure as a testing problem at the given level, allowing control of the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Methods are developed to control the FDR, separately for positive and negative excursions, as well as jointly over both. Furthermore, power is increased by incorporating a two-stage adaptive procedure. Simulation results with various signals show that our confidence regions successfully control the FDR under the nominal level. We showcase our methods with an application to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project illustrating the improvement in statistical power over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Testing for dice control at craps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dice control involves "setting" the dice and then throwing them in a careful way, in the hope of influencing the outcomes and gaining an advantage at craps. How does one test for this ability? To specify the alternative hypothesis, we need a statistical model of dice control. Two have been suggested in the gambling literature, namely the Smith-Scott model and the Wong-Shackleford model. Both models are parameterized by $\theta\in[0,1]$, which measures the shooter's level of control. We propose and compare four test statistics: (a) the sample proportion of 7s; (b) the sample proportion of pass-line wins; (c) the sample mean of hand-length observations; and (d) the likelihood ratio statistic for a hand-length sample. We want to test $H_0:\theta = 0$ (no control) versus $H_1:\theta &gt; 0$ (some control). We also want to test $H_0:\theta\le\theta_0$ versus $H_1:\theta&gt;\theta_0$, where $\theta_0$ is the "break-even point." For the tests considered we estimate the power, either by normal approximation or by simulation.</description>

      <title>Robust and Scalable Variational Bayes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a robust and scalable framework for variational Bayes (VB) that effectively handles outliers and contamination of arbitrary nature in large datasets. Our approach divides the dataset into disjoint subsets, computes the posterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these posteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets are then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures, computed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation method yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We rigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties akin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors or the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable robustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a variational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian distributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational family. To facilitate practical implementation, we adapt existing algorithms for computing the VM-Posterior and evaluate its performance through extensive numerical experiments. The results highlight its robustness and scalability, making it a reliable tool for Bayesian inference in the presence of complex, contaminated datasets.</description>

      <title>On perfect sampling: ROCFTP with Metropolis-multishift coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ROCFTP is a perfect sampling algorithm that employs various random operations, and requiring a specific Markov chain construction for each target. To overcome this requirement, the Metropolis algorithm is incorporated as a random operation within ROCFTP. While the Metropolis sampler functions as a random operation, it isn't a coupler. However, by employing normal multishift coupler as a symmetric proposal for Metropolis, we obtain ROCFTP with Metropolis-multishift. Initially designed for bounded state spaces, ROCFTP's applicability to targets with unbounded state spaces is extended through the introduction of the Most Interest Range (MIR) for practical use. It was demonstrated that selecting MIR decreases the likelihood of ROCFTP hitting $MIR^C$ by a factor of (1 - {\epsilon}), which is beneficial for practical implementation. The algorithm exhibits a convergence rate characterized by exponential decay. Its performance is rigorously evaluated across various targets, and tests ensure its goodness of fit. Lastly, an R package is provided for generating exact samples using ROCFTP Metropolis-multishift.</description>

Abstract: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) has been the focus of a successful eradication programme in Ireland, with the herd-level prevalence declining from 11.3% in 2013 to just 0.2% in 2023. As the country moves toward BVD freedom, the development of predictive models for targeted surveillance becomes increasingly important to mitigate the risk of disease re-emergence. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including binary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting BVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an extensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample sizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting, and appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value, F1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently outperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest sensitivity and AUC across scenarios, including real-world prediction of 2023 herd status, correctly identifying 219 of 250 positive herds while halving the number of herds that require compared to a blanket-testing strategy.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified approach to formal risk of bias assessments for causal and descriptive inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistics is sometimes described as the science of reasoning under uncertainty. Statistical models provide one view of this uncertainty, but what is frequently neglected is the invisible portion of uncertainty: that assumed not to exist once a model has been fitted to some data. Systematic errors, i.e. bias, in data relative to some model and inferential goal can seriously undermine research conclusions, and qualitative and quantitative techniques have been created across several disciplines to quantify and generally appraise such potential biases. Perhaps best known are so-called risk of bias assessment instruments used to investigate the quality of randomised controlled trials in medical research. However, the logic of assessing the risks caused by various types of systematic error to statistical arguments applies far more widely. This logic applies even when statistical adjustment strategies for potential biases are used, as these frequently make assumptions (e.g. data missing at random) that can never be guaranteed. Mounting concern about such situations can be seen in the increasing calls for greater consideration of biases caused by nonprobability sampling in descriptive inference (e.g. in survey sampling), and the statistical generalisability of in-sample causal effect estimates in causal inference. These both relate to the consideration of model-based and wider uncertainty when presenting research conclusions from models. Given that model-based adjustments are never perfect, we argue that qualitative risk of bias reporting frameworks for both descriptive and causal inferential arguments should be further developed and made mandatory by journals and funders. It is only through clear statements of the limits to statistical arguments that consumers of research can fully judge their value for any specific application.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking multi-step methods for the dynamic prediction of survival with numerous longitudinal predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the growing availability of biomedical datasets featuring numerous longitudinal covariates has motivated the development of several multi-step methods for the dynamic prediction of time-to-event ("survival") outcomes. These methods employ either mixed-effects models or multivariate functional principal component analysis to model and summarize the longitudinal covariates' evolution over time. Then, they use Cox models or random survival forests to predict survival probabilities, using as covariates both baseline variables and the summaries of the longitudinal variables obtained in the previous modelling step.
  Because these multi-step methods are still quite new, to date little is known about their applicability, limitations, and predictive performance when applied to real-world data. To gain a better understanding of these aspects, we performed a benchmarking of the aforementioned multi-step methods (and two simpler prediction approaches) based on three datasets that differ in sample size, number of longitudinal covariates and length of follow-up. We discuss the different modelling choices made by these methods, and some adjustments that one may need to do in order to be able to apply them to real-world data. Furthermore, we compare their predictive performance using multiple performance measures and landmark times, and assess their computing time.</description>

      <title>Change Point Detection in Dynamic Graphs with Decoder-only Latent Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04719v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript studies the unsupervised change point detection problem in time series of graphs using a decoder-only latent space model. The proposed framework consists of learnable prior distributions for low-dimensional graph representations and of a decoder that bridges the observed graphs and latent representations. The prior distributions of the latent spaces are learned from the observed data as empirical Bayes to assist change point detection. Specifically, the model parameters are estimated via maximum approximate likelihood, with a Group Fused Lasso regularization imposed on the prior parameters. The augmented Lagrangian is solved via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, and Langevin Dynamics are recruited for posterior inference. Simulation studies show good performance of the latent space model in supporting change point detection and real data experiments yield change points that align with significant events.</description>

      <title>Covariate-dependent hierarchical Dirichlet processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02676v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian hierarchical modelling is a natural framework to effectively integrate data and borrow information across groups. In this paper, we address problems related to density estimation and identifying clusters across related groups, by proposing a hierarchical Bayesian approach that incorporates additional covariate information. To achieve flexibility, our approach builds on ideas from Bayesian nonparametrics, combining the hierarchical Dirichlet process with dependent Dirichlet processes. The proposed model is widely applicable, accommodating multiple and mixed covariate types through appropriate kernel functions as well as different output types through suitable likelihoods. This extends our ability to discern the relationship between covariates and clusters, while also effectively borrowing information and quantifying differences across groups. By employing a data augmentation trick, we are able to tackle the intractable normalized weights and construct a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. The proposed method is illustrated on simulated data and two real data sets on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and calcium imaging. For scRNA-seq data, we show that the incorporation of cell dynamics facilitates the discovery of additional cell subgroups. On calcium imaging data, our method identifies interpretable clusters of time frames with similar neural activity, aligning with the observed behavior of the animal.</description>

      <title>Risk Estimate under a Time-Varying Autoregressive Model for Data-Driven Reproduction Number Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore epidemiological models which, though describing a wealth of behaviors, have previously received little attention in the signal processing literature. In this work, a generalized time-varying autoregressive model is considered, encompassing, but not reducing to, a state-of-the-art model of viral epidemics propagation. The time-varying parameter of this model is estimated via the minimization of a penalized likelihood estimator. A major challenge is that the estimation accuracy strongly depends on hyperparameters fine-tuning. Without available ground truth, hyperparameters are selected by minimizing specifically designed data-driven oracles, used as proxy for the estimation error. Focusing on the time-varying autoregressive Poisson model, the Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate formalism is generalized to construct asymptotically unbiased risk estimators based on the derivation of an original autoregressive counterpart of Stein's lemma. The accuracy of these oracles and of the resulting estimates are assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data. Then, elaborating on recent epidemiological models, a novel weekly scaled Poisson model is proposed, better accounting for intrinsic variability of the contamination while being robust to reporting errors. Finally, the overall data-driven procedure is particularized to the estimation of COVID-19 reproduction number demonstrating its ability to yield very consistent estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing power of data science can play a crucial role in addressing social discrimination, necessitating nuanced understanding and effective mitigation strategies for biases. "Data Science Looks At Discrimination" (DSLD) is an R and Python package designed to provide users with a comprehensive toolkit of statistical and graphical methods for assessing possible discrimination related to protected groups such as race, gender, and age. The package addresses critical issues by identifying and mitigating confounders and reducing bias against protected groups in prediction algorithms.
  In educational settings, DSLD offers instructors powerful tools to teach statistical principles through motivating real world examples of discrimination analysis. The inclusion of an 80 page Quarto book further supports users from statistics educators to legal professionals in effectively applying these analytical tools to real world scenarios.</description>

      <title>The underlap coefficient as a measure of a biomarker's discriminatory ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first step in evaluating a potential diagnostic biomarker is to examine the variation in its values across different disease groups. In a three-class disease setting, the volume under the receiver operating characteristic surface and the three-class Youden index are commonly used summary measures of a biomarker's discriminatory ability. However, these measures rely on a stochastic ordering assumption for the distributions of biomarker outcomes across the three groups. This assumption can be restrictive, particularly when covariates are involved, and its violation may lead to incorrect conclusions about a biomarker's ability to distinguish between the three disease classes. Even when a stochastic ordering exists, the order may vary across different biomarkers in discovery studies involving dozens or even thousands of candidate biomarkers, complicating automated ranking. To address these challenges and complement existing measures, we propose the underlap coefficient, a novel summary index of a biomarker's ability to distinguish between three (or more) disease groups, and study its properties. Additionally, we introduce Bayesian nonparametric estimators for both the unconditional underlap coefficient and its covariate-specific counterpart. These estimators are broadly applicable to a wide range of biomarkers and populations. A simulation study reveals a good performance of the proposed estimators across a range of conceivable scenarios. We illustrate the proposed approach through an application to an Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset aimed to assess how four potential AD biomarkers distinguish between individuals with normal cognition, mild impairment, and dementia, and how and if age and gender impact this discriminatory ability.</description>

      <title>ALCM: Autonomous LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To perform effective causal inference in high-dimensional datasets, initiating the process with causal discovery is imperative, wherein a causal graph is generated based on observational data. However, obtaining a complete and accurate causal graph poses a formidable challenge, recognized as an NP- hard problem. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era, indicating their emergent capabilities and widespread applicability in facilitating causal reasoning across diverse domains, such as medicine, finance, and science. The expansive knowledge base of LLMs holds the potential to elevate the field of causal reasoning by offering interpretability, making inferences, generalizability, and uncovering novel causal structures. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, named Autonomous LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery Framework (ALCM), to synergize data-driven causal discovery algorithms and LLMs, automating the generation of a more resilient, accurate, and explicable causal graph. The ALCM consists of three integral components: causal structure learning, causal wrapper, and LLM-driven causal refiner. These components autonomously collaborate within a dynamic environment to address causal discovery questions and deliver plausible causal graphs. We evaluate the ALCM framework by implementing two demonstrations on seven well-known datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ALCM outperforms existing LLM methods and conventional data-driven causal reasoning mechanisms. This study not only shows the effectiveness of the ALCM but also underscores new research directions in leveraging the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Interventional Imbalanced Multi-Modal Representation Learning via $\beta$-Generalization Front-Door Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal methods establish comprehensive superiority over uni-modal methods. However, the imbalanced contributions of different modalities to task-dependent predictions constantly degrade the discriminative performance of canonical multi-modal methods. Based on the contribution to task-dependent predictions, modalities can be identified as predominant and auxiliary modalities. Benchmark methods raise a tractable solution: augmenting the auxiliary modality with a minor contribution during training. However, our empirical explorations challenge the fundamental idea behind such behavior, and we further conclude that benchmark approaches suffer from certain defects: insufficient theoretical interpretability and limited exploration capability of discriminative knowledge. To this end, we revisit multi-modal representation learning from a causal perspective and build the Structural Causal Model. Following the empirical explorations, we determine to capture the true causality between the discriminative knowledge of predominant modality and predictive label while considering the auxiliary modality. Thus, we introduce the $\beta$-generalization front-door criterion. Furthermore, we propose a novel network for sufficiently exploring multi-modal discriminative knowledge. Rigorous theoretical analyses and various empirical evaluations are provided to support the effectiveness of the innate mechanism behind our proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a framework for high-resolution mortality simulations tailored to insured and general populations. Due to the scarcity of detailed demographic-specific mortality data, we leverage Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and Monte Carlo simulations to generate refined mortality tables that incorporate age, gender, smoker status, and regional distributions. This methodology enhances public health planning and actuarial analysis by providing enriched datasets for improved life expectancy projections and insurance product development.</description>
