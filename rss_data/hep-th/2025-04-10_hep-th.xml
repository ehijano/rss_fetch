      <title>Anomaly resolution by non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize previous results on anomaly resolution to noninvertible symmetries. Briefly, given a global symmetry G of some theory with a 't Hooft anomaly rendering it ungaugeable, the idea of anomaly resolution is to extend G to a larger anomaly-free symmetry of the same theory with a trivially-acting kernel. In previous work, several of the coauthors demonstrated that in two-dimensional theories, by virtue of decomposition, gauging the larger symmetry is equivalent to a disjoint union of theories in which a nonanomalous subgroup of G is gauged. In this paper, we consider examples in which the larger symmetry is not a group, but instead a noninvertible symmetry defined by some fusion category. In principle the same ideas apply to the case that G itself is noninvertible. We discuss the construction of larger symmetries using both SymTFT methods as well as algebraically via (quasi-)Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Compton amplitude for massive bosons of arbitrary spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we write down an analytic expression of electromagnetic tree-level Compton amplitude for a completely symmetric traceless (bosonic) higher spin particle in any dimension. Our analysis is restricted to the three-point function, which is unique in the Infrared and responsible for the Coulomb interactions/soft photon theorem. We propose an analogue of $R_\xi$ gauge in a theory of higher spin particles. We demonstrate that the theory is unitary only for $\xi=1,\infty$.</description>

      <title>On the moduli space of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moduli space of self-dual $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills instantons on $\mathbb T^4$ of topological charge $Q = r/N$, $1 \leq r \leq N-1$, is of current interest, yet is not fully understood. In this paper, starting from 't Hooft's constant field strength ($F$) instantons, the only known exact solutions on $\mathbb T^4$, we explore the moduli space via analytical and lattice tools. These solutions are characterized by two positive integers $k, \ell$, $k+\ell=N$, and are self-dual for $\mathbb T^4$ sides $L_\mu$ tuned to $k L_1 L_2 = r \ell L_3 L_4$. For gcd$(k,r) = r$, we show, analytically and numerically (for $N = 3$) that the constant-$F$ solutions are the only self-dual solutions on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, with $4r$ holonomy moduli. In contrast, when gcd$(k,r) \ne r$, we argue that the self-dual constant-$F$ solutions acquire, in addition to the $4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ holonomies, $4r - 4\text{gcd}(k,r)$ extra moduli, whose turning on makes the field strength nonabelian and non-constant. Thus, for gcd($k,r) \ne r$, 't Hooft's constant-$F$ solutions are a measure-zero subset of the moduli space on the tuned $\mathbb T^4$, a fact explaining a puzzle encountered in arXiv:2307.04795. We also show that, for $r = k = 2$, $N = 3$, the agreement between the approximate analytic solutions on the slightly detuned $\mathbb T^4$ and the $Q=2/3$ self-dual configurations obtained by minimizing the lattice action is remarkable.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of energy functionals in anti-de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal Gravity (CG) is a Weyl--invariant metric theory free of divergences that with generalized Newman boundary conditions, reduces to renormalized Einstein--AdS gravity. By evaluating CG's action on a replica orbifold, one obtains a codimension-2 local conformal invariant functional, $L_\Sigma$, which recovers known results as the renormalized area, the reduced Hawking mass and the Willmore Energy. Although it was anticipated that $L_\Sigma$ would be finite, a general analysis of its asymptotic behavior near the conformal boundary remains unexplored. In this work, we show that $L_\Sigma$ is finite for a boundary--anchored surface $\Sigma$ embedded in an arbitrary ambient spacetime, including surfaces that are non--minimal and are anchored at arbitrary angles. This result extends the conformal renormalization prescription to codimension--2 functionals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in supersymmetric field theory is that supersymmetry transformations on field variables generally form an algebra only on-shell, i.e. upon imposing the field equations. We show that this issue is defused in a manifestly relational - and thus automatically invariant - formulation of supersymmetric field theory, achieved through the application of the Dressing Field Method of symmetry reduction, a systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>Statistical Physics of the Polarised IKKT Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarised IKKT matrix model is the worldpoint theory of $N$ D-instantons in a background three-form flux of magnitude $\Omega$, and promises to be a highly tractable model of holography. The matrix integral can be viewed as a statistical physics partition function with inverse temperature $\Omega^4$. At large $\Omega$ the model is dominated by a matrix configuration corresponding to a 'polarised' spherical D1-brane. We show that at a critical value of $\Omega^2 N$ the model undergoes a first order phase transition, corresponding to tunneling into a collection of well-separated D-instantons. These instantons are the remnant of a competing saddle in the high $\Omega$ phase corresponding to spherical $(p,q)$ fivebranes. We use a combination of numerical and analytical arguments to capture the different regimes of the model.</description>

      <title>Graviton stimulated emission in squeezed vacuum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state in a thermal radiation background. Unlike traditional treatments that rely on the Boltzmann equation, we employ the Heisenberg equation and average it over general quantum states. In contrast to the usual Boltzmann-based descriptions, our approach captures the subtleties arising from quantum coherence in different number eigenstates, which is essential for soft graviton modes in the squeezed vacuum state. Our new method successfully reproduces the previous one-loop results within the in-in formalism when the expansion parameter is small and deviates significantly as the parameter increases, indicating that our results extend beyond the one-loop in-in formalism. We examine the implications of graviton emission effects stimulated by quantum coherence in both flat and expanding backgrounds. In the flat background, it is found that backreaction of radiation on the spacetime dynamics is crucial for significant stimulated emission. In the expanding background, to avoid the subtleties associated with superhorizon modes, we investigate the effect of emission within the horizon immediately after reheating and find a significant effect. We examined the IR graviton evolution from a symmetry perspective and propose a regularization prescription to eliminate the secular growth problem.</description>

      <title>On BPS Equations of Generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs Model with Scalars-Dependent Coupling $\theta$-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a most general $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs model consist of terms up to quadratic in first-derivative of the fields, that is the generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs with additional scalars-dependent coupling $\theta$-term. Using the BPS Lagrangian method we try to find Bogomolnyi's equations for BPS monopoles and dyons by taking most general BPS Lagrangian density. We obtain more general Bogomolnyi's equations and a relation between all scalars dependent couplings. Interestingly we find the value of $\theta$-term's coupling gives additional contribution to electric charge of BPS Dyons, and thus can determine whether we get BPS monopoles or BPS dyons.</description>

      <title>Emergent metric from wavelet-transformed quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06698v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method of reverse holography by which a bulk metric is shown to arise from locally computable multiscale correlations of a boundary quantum field theory (QFT). The metric is obtained from the Petz-R\'enyi mutual information using as input the correlations computed from the continuous wavelet transform. We show for free massless fermionic and bosonic QFTs that the emerging metric is asymptotically anti-de Sitter space (AdS), and that the parameters fixing the geometry are tunable by changing the chosen wavelet basis. The method is applicable to a variety of boundary QFTs that need not be conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory on Multifractal Spacetime: Varying Dimension and Ultraviolet Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by various quantum gravity approaches, we explore quantum field theory where spacetime exhibits scaling properties and dimensional reduction with changing energy scales, effectively behaving as a multifractal manifold. Working within canonical quantization, we demonstrate how to properly quantize fields in such multifractal spacetime. Our analysis reveals that a non-differentiable nature of spacetime is not merely compatible with quantum field theory but significantly enhances its mathematical foundation. Most notably, this approach guarantees the finiteness of the theory at all orders in perturbation theory and enables rigorous construction of the S-matrix in the interaction picture. The multifractal structure tames dominant, large-order divergence sources in the perturbative series and resolves the Landau pole problem through asymptotic safety, substantially improving the theory's behavior in the deep ultraviolet regime. Our formulation preserves all established predictions of standard quantum field theory at low energies while offering novel physical behaviors at high energy scales.</description>

      <title>M-theory boundaries beyond supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral worldvolume theory of an M-theory boundary (the so-called M9 brane) is uniquely determined by supersymmetry and anomaly inflow. In this brief note we investigate whether alternative chiral boundary field contents may be allowed by anomaly cancellation once supersymmetry is dropped. Even then, anomaly inflow places stringent constraints on the gauge group $G$ and matter content of the boundary worldvolume theory, which we determine explicitly. We find the most general solution to these constraints in the case where all matter fields are of the same chirality, for all simple Lie algebras except $\mathfrak{sp}_2$, $\mathfrak{su}_{n\leq5}$, and $\mathfrak{so}_{n}$ with $7\leq n\leq 12$, and find no solutions other than the supersymmetric $E_8$ boundary of Ho\v{r}ava and Witten. However, when we extend our search to allow for any chirality in the matter fields, we find one minimal solution with gauge group $G_2$, charged matter in the $\mathsf{14}$, $\mathsf{27}$ and $\mathsf{77}$ representations, which satisfies all constraints in a non-trivial way. Therefore, it could in principle describe the low-energy theory of a novel nonsupersymmetric M-theory boundary condition, different from the Ho\v{r}ava-Witten proposal. We briefly discuss some consequences if this was indeed the case, such as the existence of a non-supersymmetric, exotic "$G_2$-string" CFT in 6d, and a novel, non-perturbative, heterotic-like 10d string with gauge group $G_2\times G_2$.</description>

      <title>Bulk metric reconstruction from entanglement data via minimal surface area variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk geometries from boundary entanglement entropy data for ball-shaped entangling regions. By deriving an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in entanglement entropy to deviations of the bulk metric about a fixed background. Applying this formula, we recover the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the low-temperature regime to first order. We further extend our analysis to include deformations of the bulk geometry with nontrivial dependence on boundary directions, and propose an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at recovering the full spacetime starting close to a conformal fixed point. We do this by building on recent advances in the mathematics of inverse problems by introducing the higher-order linearization method as a new tool in the context of holographic bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Nonhermitian topological zero modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmode of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. Recently, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been extended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as gain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra can be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane, whether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines, respectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be continuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the analytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero energy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct phases, by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian regime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities and is not affected by the details of the spatial dependence of the scalar fields. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of boundary modes in nonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining Mixed Dark Matter models with high redshift Lyman-alpha forest data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study sets new constraints on Cold+Warm Dark Matter (CWDM) models by leveraging the small-scale suppression of structure formation imprinted in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Using the Sherwood-Relics suite, we extract high-fidelity flux power spectra from simulated Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, spanning a broad range of cosmologies and thermal histories. This enables precise constraints on the warm dark matter (WDM) fraction, $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$, and the mass of the WDM particle, $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$. A key advancement of our analysis is the integration of a neural network emulator directly at the likelihood level, significantly accelerating Bayesian parameter inference. With new observations of high-redshift ($z$ = 4.2$-$5.0) quasar spectra from UVES and HIRES, we establish stringent upper limits: for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 1 keV, we find $f_{\mathrm{WDM}} &lt; 0.16$ (2$\sigma$), with constraints loosening to 35\%, 50\%, and 67\% for $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ = 2, 3, and 4 keV, respectively. Our results for pure WDM reaffirm the lower bounds of previous work. Crucially, we account for the fixed resolution of simulations and the impact of patchy reionization, demonstrating their minimal influence on mixed dark matter constraints. This robustness paves the way for tighter bounds with improved statistical samples in the future. Our findings suggest that CWDM models can naturally accommodate mild suppression of matter clustering in the high redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest 1D flux power, potentially offering a resolution to some of the ongoing cosmological tensions at low redshifts, namely the $S_{8}$ tension.</description>

      <title>Three-Loop QCD corrections to the production of a Higgs boson and a Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute three-loop QCD corrections to the scattering amplitude of a Higgs boson and three partons interfered with its tree level counterpart. Specifically, we derive our results in the generalized leading color limit. Our results are represented in terms of so-called multiple polylogarithms and thus ready for use in phenomenological predictions. We provide the three-loop amplitudes necessary to compute the production cross section of a Higgs boson and a hadronic jet at hadron colliders and the decay probability of a Higgs boson to three hadronic jets at lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>A critical theory for solidification of a liquid Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple description of a zero-temperature phase transition between a liquid metal and a solid. The critical point has a Fermi surface as well as a Bose surface, a sphere in momentum space of gapless bosonic excitations. We find a fixed point of the renormalization group governing such a non-Fermi liquid, using an expansion in the codimension of both the Fermi and Bose surfaces. We comment on the nature of the solid phase and possible physical realizations.</description>

      <title>Emergent Theory for Constitutive Relations in Classical Defect Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical, acoustic, hydrodynamic, and thermal defect systems are often studied by analogy with each other. This may indicate that we may find a emergent theory for constitutive relations of classical defect systems. Start with thermal systems, we put up with a bootstrap method to describe classical transport. We conjecture that Landau-Khalatnikov equation could provide heat constitutive relations when taking heat flux as order parameter. We show that the corresponding effctive Lagrangian has similar form of that of Wick-rotated complex scalar field theory at non-relativistic limit, and only in perfect conducting situation that this system is a canonical ensemble. We argue that our method could be generalized to other systems besides thermal ones. By analogy with ferroelectrics, we propose the thermal domain model, which is a conserved current XY model. Phase transition of the thermal system is qualitatively discussed in this model.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Fermionic Field Entanglement in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density
  of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider different vacua, including the Boulware, Hartle Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh vacua, and investigate various configurations depending on the choice of 2-bein in the
  interaction Hamiltonian. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian
  behavior in the HHI state, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a bosonic or fermionic
  thermal bath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein respectively. Further, we observe that the anti-Hawking
  effect enhances the entanglement between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation
  decreases it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking effect, the mutual information and concurrence
  near the event horizon can be non-zero even for static detectors with static 2-bein, which is in contrast with the case
  of scalar field. We also show that the near-horizon entanglement properties for static detectors in the HHI state have
  similar behaviour with those in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated detectors in Rindler spacetime. Conclusions
  are discussed.</description>

      <title>Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the impact of collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of the generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface, arising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a paradigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong interactions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic order parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs)for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have focussed on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and assuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In particular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs. The final results show that that the emergent modes are long-lived and robust against the damping effects brought about the collision integral(s), exhibiting the same qualitative features as obtained from the no-collision approximations.</description>

Abstract: We describe a procedure for locating black hole horizons in Kerr-Schild spacetimes in the double copy paradigm. Using only single- and zeroth-copy data on flat spacetime, our procedure predicts the existence of trapped surfaces in the double-copy gravitational solution. We show explicitly how this procedure locates the horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole and the general Myers-Perry black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss FLRW-cosmologies with negatively-curved spatial slices that induce a late-time freezing of all the moduli of an effective field theory through Hubble friction, independently of the moduli-space curvature. This holds for pure moduli, which appear ubiquitously in string compactifications. Crucially, the cosmological solutions approach a Milne universe. Hence, the mechanism we describe in fact corresponds to late-time moduli freezing into Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Designer bubble walls in a holographic Weyl semi-metal with magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bubble walls in the holographic D3/probe D7 system that is dual to strongly coupled quark dynamics. We work to construct holographic descriptions of bubble wall junctions where we can tune the bubble wall height and pressure difference in a theory at zero temperature and density. We study the system in the presence of a background axial vector field b (associated with the z direction) that induces a Weyl semi-metal, massless phase and a perpendicular background magnetic field Bx which favours mass generation. We find a first order transition line in the mass-Bx plane, at fixed b, ending at a critical point. We present some preliminary solutions of PDEs that describe the motion of one dimensional bubble walls in this theory, with a stationary initial condition - large pressure differences accelerate the wall to the speed of light whilst when the pressure difference is small the wall slumps to an interpolating solution. We also take the first steps to include temperature and see evidence of thermal drag slowing the wall motion. Slump configurations at finite temperature show some signs of a back pressure wave against the wall motion.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show how the finite formulation of QFT based on Callan-Symanzik equations can be generalised to the case of non-renormalizable theories. We derive an equation for effective action for an arbitrary single scalar field theory, allowing us to perform computations without running in intermediate divergencies. We illustrate the method with the use of $\lambda\phi^4 + \phi^6/M^2$ theory by the explicit (and fully finite) calculations of the effective potential as well as two-, four- and six-point correlation functions at one loop level and demonstrate that no quantum corrections to scalar mass $m^2$, depending on $M^2$-scale, are generated.</description>

      <title>From Operator Product Expansion to Anomalous Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for computing the renormalization functions, which is based on the ideas of operator product expansion and large momentum expansion. In this method, the renormalization $Z$-factors are determined by the ultraviolet finiteness of Wilson coefficients in the dimensional regularization scheme. The ultraviolet divergence is extracted solely from two-point functions at the large momentum limit. We develop this method in scalar field theories and provide a general framework for computing anomalous dimensions of the field, mass, couplings and composite operators. In particular, it is applied to the 6-dimensional cubic scalar theory and the 4-dimensional quartic scalar theory. We demonstrate this method by computing the anomalous dimension of the $\phi^Q$ operator in cubic theory up to four loops for arbitrary $Q$, which is in agreement with the known result in the large $N$ limit. The idea of computing anomalous dimensions from operator production expansion is general and can be extended beyond scalar theories, and it is demonstrated by examples of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model with general operators.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Casimir effect for parallel plates within the framework of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory in $3+1$ dimensions, considering the effects of roughness, anisotropic scaling factor, and an uniform constant magnetic field. Quantum fluctuations are induced by an anisotropic charged-scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. To incorporate surface roughness, we apply a coordinate transformation to flatten the plates, treating the remaining roughness terms as potential. The spectrum is derived using perturbation theory and regularized with the $\zeta$-function method. As an illustrative example, we consider plates with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the spectrum of the Carrollian superstring in the flipped vacuum (the highest-weight representation) in detail. The target spacetime of the Carrollian string has a generalized Carrollian symmetry, and it is composed of both Poincar\'e directions and Carrollian directions. We explicitly show that two homogeneous Carrollian superstring theories, one with compactified Poincar\'e direction and the other with compactified Carrollian direction, share the same BMS$_3$ symmetry, and their zero modes can be identified under the usual T-duality transformation. Moreover, we investigate the spectrum of a general Carrollian superstring in the flipped vacuum. As the string can still have nonvanishing winding along the spatial direction in the infinite radius limit, the spectrum of the Carrollian strings in the flat background is no longer truncated. We furthermore construct the vertex operators of gravitons and discuss their scattering amplitudes. We find that the form of 3-point amplitudes differs from that of the usual tensile superstrings only by a simple function, which reflects the ultra-local nature of Carrollian physics.</description>

Abstract: The color-flavor locked phase of high density QCD admits non-Abelian vortices, that are superfluid vortices with confined color-magnetic fluxes. Vortex solutions were thus far constructed in an axially symmetric Ansatz with common vortex winding in the left- and right-handed diquark condensates. In this paper, we explore vortex solutions without any Ansatz. In addition to axially symmetric configurations known before, we find that the axial symmetry is broken in certain parameter regions; in one case a single vortex is split into two chiral non-Abelian vortices, i.e. vortices with winding only in the left or right-handed diquark condensate, and they are connected by one or two domain walls forming a non-Abelian vortex molecule. In the other case, a chiral non-Abelian vortex molecule is confined inside a domain wall elongated to spatial infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study and prove properties of the minimax formulation of the HRT holographic entanglement entropy formula, which involves finding the maximal-area surface on a timelike hypersurface, or time-sheet, and then minimizing over the choice of time-sheet. In this formulation, the homology condition is imposed at the level of the spacetime: the homology regions are spacetime volumes rather spatial regions. We show in particular that the smallest minimax homology region is the entanglement wedge. The minimax prescription suggests a way to construct a graph model for time-dependent states, a weighted graph on which min cuts compute HRT entropies. The existence of a graph model would imply that HRT entropies obey the same inequalities as RT entropies, in other words that the RT and HRT entropy cones coincide. Our construction of a graph model relies on the time-sheets obeying a certain ``cooperating'' property, which we show holds in some examples and for which we give a partial proof; however, we also find scenarios where it may fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The period geometry of Calabi-Yau $n$-folds, characterised by their variations of Hodge structure governed by Griffiths transversality, a graded Frobenius algebra, an integral monodromy and an intriguing arithmetic structure, is analysed for applications in string compactifications and to Feynman integrals. In particular, we consider type IIB flux compactifications on Calabi-Yau three-folds and elliptically fibred four-folds. After constructing suitable three-parameter three-folds, we examine the relation between symmetries of their moduli spaces and flux configurations. Although the fixed point loci of these symmetries are projective special K\"ahler, we show that a simultaneous stabilisation of multiple moduli on the intersection of these loci need not be guaranteed without the existence of symmetries between them. We furthermore consider F-theory vacua along conifolds and use mirror symmetry to perform a complete analysis of the two-parameter moduli space of an elliptic Calabi-Yau four-fold fibred over $\mathbb{P}^3$. We use the relation between Calabi-Yau period geometries in various dimensions and, in particular, the fact that the antisymmetric products of one-parameter Calabi-Yau three-fold operators yield four-fold operators to establish pairs of flux vacua on the moduli spaces of the three- and four-fold compactifications. We give a splitting of the period matrix into a semisimple and nilpotent part by utilising the Frobenius structure. This helps bringing $\epsilon$-dimensional regulated integration by parts relations between Feynman integrals into $\epsilon$-factorised form and solve them by iterated integrals of the periods.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Ricci-flat metrics in four dimensions that are stationary and algebraically special, together with the locally asymptotically flat conditions in the Bondi-Sachs framework. The Einstein equation is reduced to Laplacian equation on the celestial sphere. The solutions consist of two pairs of arbitrary holomorphic and antiholomorphic functions analogous to the Virasoro modes. We show that the higher modes of one pair of the (anti-)holomorphic function contain an infinite tower of soft hairs from the perspective of the asymptotic supertranslation charges. Within our general ansatz, we obtain the complete set of algebraic Petrov type-D solutions of five parameters. We show that the type-D solution is diffeomorphism to the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States and Symmetry: A Group-Theoretic Approach to Gauge-Invariant Packaged Entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20295</link>

Abstract: A packaged quantum state refers to a quantum state that includes an inseparable block of internal quantum numbers. These types of quantum states are the result of gauge invariance and superselection, and therefore have particular symmetric structures. Here we show that, in multiparticle quantum systems, any nontrivial representation of a finite or compact group inherently induces packaged entanglement that inseparably entangles every internal quantum number (IQN). 
In this theory, every single-particle excitation carries an inseparable IQN block controlled by the irreducible representation of the group. The local gauge constraints or superselection rules forbid the occurrence of any partial charges or partial IQN entanglement. We demonstrate this principle using various specific symmetries, such as gauge symmetries ($U(1)$, $SU(2)$, and $SU(3)$), discrete symmetries (charge conjugation $C$, parity $P$, time reversal $T$, and their combinations), and $p$-form symmetries. In each case, gauge invariance and superselection rules ensure that the resulting quantum states cannot be factorized. We then used these ideas to explain phenomena like Bell-type structures, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations. The packaging principle connects concepts from gauge theory, topological classifications, and quantum information. These results may be useful for applications in exotic hadron spectroscopy, extended symmetries in quantum field theory, and quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: The topological string/spectral theory correspondence establishes a precise, non-perturbative duality between topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds and the spectral theory of quantized mirror curves. While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantization of gauge theories with Lagrange multipliers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisited the equivalence between the second- and first-order formulations of the Yang-Mills (YM) and gravity using the path integral formalism. We demonstrated that structural identities can be derived to relate Green's functions of auxiliary fields, computed in the first-order formulation, to Green's functions of composite fields in the second-order formulation. In YM theory, these identities can be verified at the integrand level of the loop integrals. For gravity, the path integral was obtained through the Faddeev-Senjanovi\'c procedure. The Senjanovi\'c determinant plays a key role in canceling tadpole-like contributions, which vanish in the dimensional regularization scheme but persist at finite temperature. Thus, the equivalence between the two formalisms is maintained at finite temperature. We also studied the coupling to matter. In YM theory, we investigated both minimal and non-minimal couplings. We derived first-order formulations, equivalent to the respective second-order formulations, by employing a procedure that introduces Lagrange multipliers (LM). This procedure can be easily generalized to gravity. We also considered an alternative gravity model, which is both renormalizable and unitary, that uses LM to restrict the loop expansion to one-loop order. However, this approach leads to a doubling of one-loop contributions due to the additional degrees of freedom associated with Ostrogradsky instabilities. To address this, we proposed a modified formalism that resolves these issues by requiring the path integral to be invariant under field redefinitions. This introduces ghost fields responsible for canceling the extra one-loop contributions arising from the LM fields, while also removing unphysical degrees of freedom. We also demonstrated that the modified formalism and the Faddeev-Popov procedure commute, indicating that the LM can be viewed as purely quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Computable and Faithful Lower Bound on Entanglement Cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing logarithmic $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are not PPT, establishing their faithfulness. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have shown promise in many sectors of cosmology. However, recent constraints from the speed of gravitational waves have put severe limits on the breadth of models such classes of theories can realize. In this work, we explore the possibility of a string-like Horndeski Lagrangian that is equipped with two dilaton fields. This is an interesting low-energy effective string theory that has a healthy general relativity limit. The evolution of a two-dilation coupled cosmology is not well-known in the literature. We explore the tensor perturbations in order to assess the behavior of the model again the speed of gravitational wave constraint. Our main result is that this model exhibits of a class of cosmological theories that is consistent with this observational constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the climate crisis intensifies, understanding the environmental impact of professional activities is paramount, especially in sectors with historically significant resource utilisation. This includes High Energy Physics (HEP) and related fields, which investigate the fundamental laws of our universe. As members of the young High Energy Physicists (yHEP) association, we investigate the CO$_2$-equivalent emissions generated by HEP-related research on a personalised per-researcher level, for four distinct categories: Experiments, tied to collaborations with substantial infrastructure; Institutional, representing the resource consumption of research institutes and universities; Computing, focussing on simulations and data analysis; and Travel, covering professional trips to conferences, etc. The findings are integrated into a tool for self-evaluation, the Know-your-footprint (Kyf) calculator, allowing the assessment of the personal and professional footprint and optionally sharing the data with the yHEP association. The study aims to heighten awareness, foster sustainability, and inspire the community to adopt more environmentally responsible research practices urgently.</description>

      <title>Wick rotation in the lapse, admissible complex metrics, and foliation changing diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Wick rotation in the lapse (not in time) is introduced that interpolates between Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics on real manifolds admitting a codimension-one foliation. The definition refers to a fiducial foliation but covariance under foliation changing diffeomorphisms can be rendered explicit in a reformulation as a rank one perturbation. Applied to scalar field theories a Lorentzian signature action develops a positive imaginary part thereby identifying the underlying complex metric as ``admissible''. This admissibility is ensured in non-fiducial foliations in technically distinct ways also for the variation with respect to the metric and for the Hessian. The Hessian of the Wick rotated action is a complex combination of a generalized Laplacian and a d'Alembertian, which is shown to have spectrum contained in a wedge of the upper complex half plane. Specialized to near Minkowski space the induced propagator differs from the one with the Feynman $i\epsilon$ prescription and on Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre backgrounds the difference to a Wick rotation in time is illustrated.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze all possible symmetry reductions of Lagrangians that yield fully equivalent field equations for any 4-dimensional metric theory of gravity. Specifically, we present a complete list of infinitesimal group actions obeying the principle of symmetric criticality, identify the corresponding invariant metrics (and $l$-chains), discuss relations among them, and analyze simplifications allowed by the residual diffeomorphism group and Noether identities before and after variation of the reduced Lagrangian. We employ rigorous treatment of the symmetry reduction by Fels and Torre and use the Hicks classification of infinitesimal group actions by means of Lie algebras pairs of isometries and their isotropy subalgebras. The classification is recast in the coordinates in which the well-known symmetries and geometries are easily recognizable and relatable to each other. The paper is accompanied by a code for the symmetry reduction of Lagrangians that we developed in \texttt{xAct} package of \textsc{Mathematica}.</description>

      <title>Lattice simulations of axion-U(1) inflation: gravitational waves, magnetic fields, and scalar statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study axion-U(1) inflation, focusing on the regime where the coupling between axions and gauge fields results in significant backreaction from the amplified gauge fields during inflation. These amplified gauge fields not only generate high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), but also enhance spatial inhomogeneities in the axion field. GWs serve as key probe for constraining the coupling strength between the axion and gauge fields. We find that, when backreaction is important during inflation, the constraints on the coupling strength due to GW overproduction are relaxed compared to previous studies, in which backreaction matters only after inflation. Moreover, our results suggest that the probability density function (PDF) of axion fluctuations tends toward a Gaussian distribution even in cases where gauge field backreaction is important only after inflation. This aligns with previous studies where the same effect was observed for cases with strong backreaction during inflation. This finding can be crucial for future studies of primordial black hole (PBH) formation, which can further constrain the coupling strength. We also calculate the spectrum of the produced magnetic fields in this model and find that their strength is compatible with the observed lower limits.</description>

      <title>Source multipoles and energy-momentum tensors for spinning black holes and other compact objects in arbitrary dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working in momentum space and at linear order in the gravitational coupling, we derive the most general class of energy-momentum tensors associated with a given multipolar structure of the spacetime in arbitrary dimensions, and built out of a mass and an angular momentum, at any order in the spin expansion. In this formalism, we are able to derive directly the full multipolar structure of any solution from the multipole expansion of the energy-momentum tensor, in complete analogy to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we identify the recurrence relations that allow obtaining the multipolar structure of the Kerr and the Myers-Perry black hole solutions, defining source multipoles in a General Relativity context for the first time. For these solutions, we are able to resum the energy-momentum tensor in momentum space at all orders in the angular momentum, and compute its real-space version. In the Kerr case we exactly obtain the matter source found by Israel, namely an equatorial, pressureless thin disk rotating at superluminal speed. For Myers-Perry in five dimensions, the matter distribution is a three-ellipsoid in four spatial dimensions with nontrivial stresses. Remarkably, for any dimensions, the matter configuration is a lower-dimensional distribution which has the same singularity structure as the fully non-linear black-hole solution. Our formalism underscores the advantage of working in momentum space to generate nontrivial matter sources for non-linear spacetimes, and could be used to construct regular non-exotic matter configurations that source spinning black hole solutions or horizonless compact objects with the same multipolar structure as black holes.</description>

      <title>Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. By incorporating the effects of Lorentz-violating term $\ell$ and the monopole charge $\eta$ in the KR field, we derive the modified gravitational field equations and analyze the resulting black hole spacetime. The obtained solution exhibits deviations from the Schwarzschild metric with topological defect, as it is influenced by the monopole charge and self-interaction potential. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, revealing novel stability conditions. Additionally, we perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge. Our findings suggest that these parameters have to be significantly small, although there are different constraints imposed by individual tests, ranging from $10^{-9}\leq|\ell|\leq 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-9}\leq\eta\leq 10^{-6}\, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>$\tt GrayHawk$: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and describe $\tt GrayHawk$, a publicly available Mathematica-based tool designed for the efficient computation of gray-body factors for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. This program provides users with a rapid and reliable means to compute gray-body factors for massless fields with spin \(s = 0, 1/2, 1, 2\) in modes specified by the angular quantum number \(l\), given a black hole metric and the associated parameter values. $\tt GrayHawk$ is preloaded with seven different black hole metrics, offering immediate applicability to a variety of theoretical models. Additionally, its modular structure allows users to extend its functionality easily by incorporating alternative metrics or configurations. This versatility makes $\tt GrayHawk$ a powerful and adaptable resource for researchers studying black hole physics and Hawking radiation. The codes described in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/marcocalza89/GrayHawk.</description>
