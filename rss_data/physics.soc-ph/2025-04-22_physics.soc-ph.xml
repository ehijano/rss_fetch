      <title>We Are What We Buy: Extracting urban lifestyles using large-scale delivery records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifestyle has been used as a lens to characterize a society and its people within, which includes their social status, consumption habits, values, and cultural interests. Recently, the increasing availability of large-scale purchasing records, such as credit card transaction data, has enabled data-driven studies to capture lifestyles through consumption behavior. However, the lack of detailed information on individual purchases prevents researchers from constructing a precise representation of lifestyle structures through the consumption pattern. Here, we extract urban lifestyle patterns as a composition of fine-grained product categories that are significantly consumed together. Leveraging 103,342,186 package delivery records from 2018 to 2022 in Seoul, Republic of Korea, we construct a co-consumption network of detailed product categories and systematically identify lifestyles as clusters in the network. Our results reveal five lifestyle clusters: 'Beauty lovers', 'Fashion lovers', 'Work and life', 'Homemakers', and 'Baby and hobbyists', which represent distinctive lifestyles while also being connected to each other. Moreover, the geospatial distribution of lifestyle clusters aligns with regional characteristics (business vs. residential areas) and is associated with multiple demographic characteristics of residents, such as income, birth rate, and age. Temporal analysis further demonstrates that lifestyle patterns evolve in response to external disruptions, such as COVID-19. As urban societies become more multifaceted, our framework provides a powerful tool for researchers, policymakers, and businesses to understand the shifting dynamics of contemporary lifestyles.</description>

      <title>Long-term disparities in the recovery of urban mobility after COVID-19 in Latin America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions to the patterns of urban mobility. Existing work has overwhelmingly focused on the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on human mobility during 2020, particularly in countries of the Global North. It showed that the pandemic resulted in an increased gap, benefitted affluent and core urban areas with larger reductions in mobility. Yet, little is know about the long-term persistence of these unequal impacts beyond 2020, and in countries of the Global South where socioeconomic disparities are more acute. Using over 100 million anonymised daily records of mobile phone data from Meta-Facebook users from March 2020 to May 2022, we aim to determine the long-term geographic and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on mobility patterns in Latin America. Our findings reveal that the mobility disparities triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic have endured, with affluent and densely populated areas displaying lower mobility rates than more deprived and sparsely populated places. We also show that the magnitude of the reduction in mobility levels early in the COVID-19 pandemic largely determined the extent of mobility differential between socioeconomic groups. We find no signs of full recovery to baseline levels of mobility in some urban cores, suggesting some lost of appeal as attractors of economic activity. Overall, our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to amplified pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities and redefined the role of cities in Latin American countries.</description>

      <title>Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Poised to Rocket: Modeling the Environmental Impact of LEO Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of satellite megaconstellations in low Earth orbit (LEO) represents a significant advancement in global broadband connectivity. However, we urgently need to understand the potential environmental impacts, particularly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with these constellations. This study addresses a critical gap in modeling current and future GHG emissions by developing a comprehensive open-source life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, applied to 10 launch vehicles and 15 megaconstellations. Our analysis reveals that the production of launch vehicles and propellant combustion during launch events contribute most significantly to overall GHG emissions, accounting for 72.6% of life cycle emissions. Among the rockets analyzed, reusable vehicles like Falcon-9 and Starship demonstrate 95.4% lower production emissions compared to non-reusable alternatives, highlighting the environmental benefits of reusability in space technology. The findings underscore the importance of launch vehicle and satellite design choices to minimize potential environmental impacts. The Open-source Rocket and Constellation Lifecycle Emissions (ORACLE) repository is freely available and aims to facilitate further research in this field. This study provides a critical baseline for policymakers and industry stakeholders to develop strategies for reducing the carbon footprint of the space industry, especially satellite megaconstellations.</description>

      <title>Managing CO2 under global and country-specific net-zero emissions targets in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Union (EU) aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This requires capturing CO2, eventually transporting it to different regions, and either converting it into valuable products or sequestering it underground. Although the target is set for the entire EU, in practice, most of the governance and strategy to attain it remains in the individual member states. Previous literature modelling how Europe can achieve carbon neutrality has either considered only a global CO2 limit or used coarse spatial and temporal representation without proper network modelling. Here, we use a highly-resolved open model of the European sector-coupled energy system, PyPSA-Eur, to explore the impacts of imposing net-zero emissions globally for the entire EU versus imposing carbon neutrality for each country. Forcing net-zero emissions in every country increases system cost by 1.4%, demands varied CO2 prices, and triggers higher investment in direct air capture and renewable capacities. Furthermore, in both scenarios, a significant portion of the captured CO2 is transported across Europe, either directly via CO2 pipelines or indirectly via solid biomass or synthetic methane gas, methanol, and oil. Our research enables quantifying the impact of following a collaborative or self-sufficient carbon management strategy to attain carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>Indirect reciprocity as a dynamics for weak balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A social network is often divided into many factions. People are friends within each faction, while they are enemies of the other factions, and even my enemy's enemy is not necessarily my friend. This configuration can be described in terms of a weak form of structural balance. Although weak balance explains a number of real social networks, which dynamical rule achieves it has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we show that the answer can be found in the field of indirect reciprocity, which assumes that people assess each other's behavior and choose how to behave to others based on the assessment according to a social norm. We begin by showing that weak structural balance is equivalent to stationarity when the rule is given by a norm called `judging'. By analyzing its cluster dynamics of merging, fission, and migration induced by assessment error in complete graphs, we obtain the cluster size distribution in a steady state, which shows the coexistence of a giant cluster and smaller ones. This study suggests that indirect reciprocity can provide insight into the interplay between a norm that individuals abide by and the macroscopic group structure in society.</description>

      <title>Building floorspace and stock measurement: A review of global efforts, knowledge gaps, and research priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite a substantial body of research-evidenced by our analysis of 2,628 peer-reviewed papers-global building floorspace data remain fragmented, inconsistent, and methodologically diverse. The lack of high-quality and openly accessible datasets poses major challenges to accurately assessing building carbon neutrality. This review focuses on global building floorspace, especially its nexus with energy and emissions. The key research areas include energy modeling, emissions analysis, building retrofits, and life cycle assessments. Each measurement approach-top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid-has its own limitations: top-down methods provide broad estimates but low accuracy, whereas bottom-up approaches are more precise but data intensive. Our simulations reveal a surge in floorspace growth across emerging economies-most notably in India, Indonesia, and Africa-with India's per capita floorspace projected to triple by 2070. We emphasize the need for a high-resolution global floorspace imagery database to compare energy efficiency, track decarbonization progress, and assess renovation impacts while promoting building sufficiency and accelerating the transition to net-zero building systems.</description>

      <title>Computing well-balanced spanning trees of unweighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A spanning tree of a network or graph is a subgraph that connects all nodes with the least number or weight of edges. The spanning tree is one of the most straightforward techniques for network simplification and sampling, and for discovering its backbone or skeleton. Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm are well-known algorithms for computing a spanning tree of a weighted network, and are therefore also the default procedure for unweighted networks in the most popular network libraries. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of these algorithms on unweighted networks and compare them with different priority-first search algorithms. We show that the structure of a network, such as the distances between the nodes, is better preserved by a simpler algorithm based on breadth-first search. The spanning trees are also most compact and well-balanced as measured by classical graph indices. We support our findings with experiments on synthetic graphs and more than a thousand real networks, and demonstrate practical applications of the computed spanning trees. We conclude that if a spanning tree is to maintain the structure of an unweighted network, the breadth-first search algorithm should be the preferred choice.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil RL: Backdoor attack via Stock market, Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example,financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning and a method of detection by dynamic systems and statistical analysis of the distribution of data. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.</description>
