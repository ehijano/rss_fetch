      <title>A canonical discrete analogue of the classical circular cross sections of ellipsoids and their isometric deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a novel discretization procedure which has recently been proposed and applied in the construction of a canonical discrete analogue of confocal coordinate systems, an explicit method of constructing discrete analogues of ellipsoids is recorded. These discrete ellipsoids are entirely composed of planar quadrilaterals and come in pairs of combinatorially dual polyhedra, which together form princpal binets, a discrete counterpart of curvature line parametrizations. They exhibit a variety of algebraic and geometric properties which are classical in the case of their continuous counterparts. In a special case, it is demonstrated that the diagonals of the quadrilaterals of these discrete ellipsoids form two families of closed planar polygons. These polygons may be regarded as the discrete analogues of the classical circular cross sections of an ellipsoid. As in the continuous case, the discrete circles of any family lie in parallel planes and degenerate at the ``boundary'' of the discrete ellipsoids to ``umbilic vertices'' or ``umbilic edges''. Moreover, in analogy with the continuous theory, discrete ellipsoids admit a one-parameter family of deformations that preserve these discrete circles.</description>

      <title>Non-negative scalar curvature on spin surgeries and Novikov conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed aspherical manifold. Assume that the rational strong Novikov conjecture holds for $\pi_1(M)$. We show that on any spin surgery of $M$ along a region whose induced homomorphism on the fundamental group is trivial, every complete metric with non-negative scalar curvature is Ricci-flat. In particular, on the connected sum of $M$ with a spin manifold, any complete metric with non-negative scalar curvature is Ricci-flat.</description>

      <title>Manifold submetries from compact homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that singular Riemannian foliations, or, more generally, manifold submetries, defined on a compact normal homogeneous space, have algebraic nature. Moreover, in this case there exists a one-to-one correspondence between algebras of algebraic functions preserved by the Laplace--Beltrami operator, and manifold submetries.
  A key intermediate result is that, for any manifold submetry on a compact normal homogeneous space, the vector field given by the mean curvature of the fibers is basic, in the sense that it is related to a vector field in the base.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prescribed Lp curvature problem for convex capillary hypersurfaces in the Euclidean half-space. By reducing the problem to finding a convex solution of a Hessian quotient type equation with a Robin boundary condition on a spherical cap, we establish the existence and uniqueness of smooth admissible (in fact, strictly convex) solutions. As applications, we solve the capillary Lp Christoffel Minkowski problem in the smooth category, and we also obtain corresponding results for the prescribed Lp curvature problem and the related eigenvalue problem for convex capillary hypersurfaces in the Euclidean half-space.</description>

      <title>The heterotic G$_2$-system on 2-step nilmanifolds endowed with principal torus bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the heterotic G$_2$-system on 7-dimensional 2-step nilmanifolds $M=\Gamma\backslash N$ endowed with principal torus bundles. We first prove that every invariant G$_2$-structure solving the system must be coclosed (under an additional calibration assumption when the dimension of the derived Lie algebra of $N$ is $3$). Then, we discuss the existence of solutions for all possible isomorphism classes of 7-dimensional 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras, and we provide examples with constant dilaton function both when the cosmological constant of the spacetime is zero and when it is nonzero.</description>

      <title>Enhanced 3D Shape Analysis via Information Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit and complete description of bubbling limits of a non-collapsing limit of polarized K3 surfaces in terms of the period mapping. In particular, we show that bubbling limits only depend on algebro-geometric data of the given family. As a corollary, this gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of de Borbon--Spotti and confirms that Odaka's algebro-geometric candidate gives genuine bubbling limits in K3 surfaces case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent interesting work [15], W.Y. He established the important partial regularity theory and the almost optimal higher regularity theory for energy minimizing harmonic almost complex structures. Based on a new observation on the structure of equations, we give an easier new proof of the partial regularity theorem, and adapting the powerful quantitative stratification method of Naber-Valtorta [22], we further prove the rectifiability of singular stratum of energy minimizing harmonic almost complex structures. Based on this, we establish an optimal regularity theory, which improves the corresponding result of He.</description>

      <title>Fields of Toeplitz algebras for the principal symbol of regular 2-step nilpotent groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the C*-algebra of a regular 2-step nilpotent lie group can be recovered using continuous fields of Toeplitz algebras and a crossed product. We generalize this result to polycontact manifolds in the sense of van Erp which are endowed with fields of such groups. We also investigate those manifolds with a more rigid structure, namely those modeled on H-type groups. In all those cases, there is a certain pseudodifferential calculus named filtered calculus, we show that the algebra of principal symbols can also be recovered from the field of Toeplitz algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution kernel of a Toeplitz operator associated with a classical pseudodifferential operator on a compact, embeddable, strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold. The main result consists of a formula for the values at the diagonal of the second coefficient in the expansion of the symbol of the kernel. We also establish asymptotic expansions for Toeplitz operators on the positive part of a compact not necessary strictly pseudoconvex CR orbifold under certain natural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of discretely self-similar blowup for a wave maps type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-time blowup for a nonlinear wave equation for maps from the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$ into the 1-sphere $\mathbb{S}^1$, whose nonlinearity exhibits a null-form structure. We construct, for every dimension $d \geq 1$, a countable family of discretely self-similar blowup solutions, which are even for $d=1$ and radial for $d \geq 2$. The main contribution of the paper is a detailed nonlinear stability analysis of this family of solutions. For $d \geq 2$, we consider radial data, while in $d=1$ we allow for general perturbations. After linearizing around the self-similar profiles in similarity variables, we construct resolvents of the resulting highly non-self-adjoint operators through Liouville-Green transformations and precise Volterra-type asymptotics. The construction itself, which occupies most of the paper, is technically challenging, as it is performed in arbitrary dimensions and for a countable family of operators in each. Combined with a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operators, this yields sharp semigroup bounds and allows us to establish nonlinear stability of all discretely self-similar profiles in all dimensions, with precise co-dimension determined by the unstable spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence and stability of discretely self-similar blowup for a geometric wave equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a $k$-th capillary area measure for capillary convex bodies in the Euclidean half-space, which serves as a boundary counterpart to the classical concept of area measure (see, e.g., \cite[Chapter 8]{Sch}). We then propose a Christoffel-Minkowski problem for capillary convex bodies, to find a capillary convex body in the Euclidean half-space with a prescribed $k$-th capillary area measure. This problem is equivalent to solving a Hessian-type equation with a Robin boundary value condition. We then establish the existence and uniqueness of a smooth solution under a natural sufficient condition.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics a la Souriau on K\"ahler Non Compact Symmetric Spaces for Cartan Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify several issues concerning the abstract geometrical formulation of thermodynamics on non compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$ that are the mathematical model of hidden layers in the new paradigm of Cartan Neural Networks. We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {\`a} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the K\"ahler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\subset\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\mathbb{H}\subset\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincar\'e and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\mathrm{H}\subset \mathrm{U}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove for $n\in\{3,4,5\}$ that the connected sum of a closed aspherical $n$-manifold with an arbitrary non-compact manifold does not admit a complete metric with nonnegative scalar curvature. In particular, a special case of our result answers a question of Gromov.
  More generally, we generalize the partial classification result of Chodosh, Li, and Liokumovich to the non-compact domination case with our newly-developed technique.
  Our result unifies all previous results of this type, and confirms the validity of Gromov's non-compact domination conjecture for closed aspherical manifolds of dimensions 3, 4, and 5.</description>

      <title>Almost Hermitian structures on moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles and applications to the topology of symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13809v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our previous monograph arXiv:2010.15789 (to appear in AMS Memoirs), where we initiated our program to prove that the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality holds for closed, symplectic four-manifolds and, more generally, for closed, smooth four-manifolds with a Seiberg-Witten basic class. This inequality was first proved for compact, complex surfaces of general type independently by Miyaoka and Yau in 1977. Our approach uses a version of Morse theory for a natural Hamiltonian, the square of the $L^2$ norm of the coupled spinors, for the circle action on the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles over a closed four-manifold. It has the aim of proving the existence of a projectively anti-self-dual connection on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle over a blow-up of the four-manifold, where the first Pontrjagin number of the vector bundle is negative and greater than or equal to minus the Euler characteristic of the blown-up four-manifold. Our Morse theory argument relies on positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices for critical points of Hamiltonians for circle actions on complex analytic spaces (or real analytic spaces that, locally, are sufficiently well-approximated by complex analytic model spaces), as developed by the first author in arXiv:2206.14710. In our application to the moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles, the critical points are fixed points of the circle action and thus represented by Seiberg-Witten monopoles.</description>

Abstract: Let $M^{n}$, $n\in\{3,4,5\}$, be a closed aspherical $n$-manifold and $S\subset M$ a subset consisting of disjoint incompressible embedded closed aspherical submanifolds (possibly with different dimensions). When $n =3,4$, we show that $M\setminus S$ cannot admit any complete metric with positive scalar curvature. When $n=5$, we obtain the same result when $S$ contains a submanifold of codimension 1 or 2. The key ingredient is a new interior control for the extrinsic diameter of surfaces with positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality is established for closed $2$-convex spacelike hypersurface in de Sitter space by investigating the behavior of the locally constrained inverse curvature flow \begin{align} \frac{\partial }{\partial t}x=\bigg(u-\frac{\lambda'E_1}{E_2}\bigg)\nu,\nonumber \end{align} which provides a partial answer to the conjecture raised by Hu and Li in \cite{HL}.</description>

      <title>The Critical LYZ equation in K\"ahler Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of smooth solutions for the LYZ equation at the critical phase $\theta =(n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$, thereby solving the critical case of a problem posed by Collins-Jacob-Yau and Li concerning the solvability for phase $\theta \leq (n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$. As applications, we solve the 3D Hessian equation $\sigma_2 = 1$ and the 4D Hessian quotient equation $\sigma_3 = \sigma_1$ under weaker assumptions than previously required.</description>

      <title>Riemannian and Lorentzian Calder\'on problem under Magnetic Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study both the Riemannian and Lorentzian Calder\'on problem when a family of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps are given for an open set of magnetic/electromagnetic potentials. For the Riemannian version, by allowing small perturbations of the magnetic potential, we use the Runge Approximation Theorem to show that the metric can be uniquely determined. There is no gauge equivalence in this case. For the Lorentzian version, we use microlocal analysis to construct the trajectory of null-geodesics via generic perturbations of the electromagnetic potential, hence the conformal class of the metric can be constructed. Moreover, we also show, in the Lorentzian case, the same result can be obtained using generic perturbations of the metric itself.</description>

      <title>On energy bounds in asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers positive energy theorems in asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes. Particular attention is given to spacetimes where conformal infinity has compact, Einstein cross-sections admitting Killing or parallel spinors; a positive energy theorem is derived for such spacetimes in terms of geometric data intrinsic to the cross-section. This is followed by the first complete proofs of the BPS inequalities in (the bosonic sectors of) 4D and 5D minimal, gauged supergravity, including with magnetic fields, provided the Maxwell field is exact. The BPS inequalities are proven for asymptotically AdS spacetimes, but also generalised to the aforementioned class of asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Cartan meets Cram\'er-Rao</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Cartan-geometric, jet bundle formulation of curvature-aware variance bounds in parametric statistical estimation is developed. Building on our earlier extrinsic Hilbert space approach to the Cram\'er-Rao and Bhattacharyya-type inequalities, we show that the curvature corrections induced by the square root embedding of a statistical model admit a canonical intrinsic interpretation via jet geometry and Cartan's prolongation theory.
  For a scalar-parameter family with square root map $s_\theta=\sqrt{f(\cdot;\theta)}\in L^2(\mu)$, we regard $s_\theta$ as a section of the statistical bundle $E=\Theta\times L^2(\mu)$ and study its finite-order prolongations. We point out that the classical algebraic efficiency condition--that the estimator residual $(T-\theta)s_\theta$ lies in the span of derivatives of $s_\theta$ up to order $m$--is equivalent to the existence of a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) of order $m$ satisfied by the square root map. Geometrically, this means the prolonged section lies in an ODE-defined submanifold of the jet bundle and is an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field.
  The obstruction to such finite-order integrability is identified with the vertical component of the canonical Ehresmann connection on the jet tower, which coincides with the curvature correction term in variance bounds. This establishes a direct correspondence between algebraic projection conditions in $L^2(\mu)$ and intrinsic holonomy properties of statistical sections, yielding a unified geometric interpretation of higher-order information inequalities.</description>

      <title>Brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study \emph{brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces} in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes. Starting from the classical cycloidal brachistochrone in a constant gravitational field, we construct a Newtonian ``brachistochrone-ruled worldsheet'' whose rulings are time-minimizing trajectories between pairs of endpoints. We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces. Finally, we discuss basic geometric properties of such surfaces and identify natural Jacobi fields along the rulings.</description>

      <title>FLRW embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$, differential geometry and conformal photon propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces differential-geometric methods to study $n$-dimensional locally conformally flat spaces as submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$. We derive explicit formulas relating intrinsic and ambient differential-geometric objects, including curvature tensors, the codifferential and laplacian operators. We apply this approach to Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spaces using newfound embedding formulas, obtaining new and simplified expressions for the photon propagator in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>A homogeneous geometry of low-rank tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider sets of fixed CP, multilinear, and TT rank tensors, and derive conditions for when (the smooth parts of) these sets are smooth homogeneous manifolds. For CP and TT ranks, the conditions are essentially that the rank is sufficiently low. These homogeneous structures are then used to derive Riemannian metrics whose geodesics are both complete and efficient to compute.</description>
