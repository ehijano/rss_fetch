      <title>Relation between sunspots and solar EUV irradiance changes during the Gleissberg cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sunspots are the standard measure of solar magnetic activity, which are also used to estimate solar spectral irradiance over centennial time scales. However, because of the lack of homogeneous, century-long spectral measurements, the long-term relation of sunspots and spectral irradiance has not been independently validated.
  Here we aim to study the relation between sunspots and solar extreme ultra-violet (EUV) irradiance during the last 130 years, over the latest Gleissberg cycle, also called the Modern Maximum, when sunspot cycle heights varied by a factor of 2.5.
  We calculate the daily variation of the geomagnetic declination at six reliable, long-running stations, whose amplitude (or range) can be used as a centennial proxy of solar EUV irradiance. We also compare this geomagnetic proxy to the solar MgII index of EUV irradiance over the 40-year interval of overlap.
  We find that sunspot activity dominated over EUV irradiance when cycle heights increased in the early 20th century during the growth and maximum of the Modern Maximum, but EUV irradiance dominated over sunspots during the decay of the MM, when cycle heights decreased in the late 1900s.
  Our results suggest that the spot-facula ratio varies during Gleissberg cycle -type large oscillations of solar/stellar activity. This modifies the estimated stellar evolution of the relation between brightness and chromospheric activity of the Sun and Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Analysis of Parker Solar Probe Solar Wind Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset (2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters, including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms; our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</description>
