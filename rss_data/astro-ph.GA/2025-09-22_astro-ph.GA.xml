      <title>Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of Three Isolated Faint Dwarf Galaxies Beyond the Local Group: Pavo, Corvus A, and Kamino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of three recently discovered star-forming dwarf galaxies beyond the Local Group: Pavo, Corvus A, and Kamino. The discovery of Kamino is reported here for the first time. They rank among the most isolated faint dwarf galaxies known, hence they provide unique opportunities to study galaxy evolution at the smallest scales, free from environmental effects of more massive galaxies. Our HST data reach $\sim$2-4 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch for each dwarf, allowing us to measure their distances, structural properties, and recent star formation histories (SFHs). All three galaxies contain a complex stellar population of young and old stars, and are typical of field galaxies in this mass regime ($M_V=-10.62\pm0.08$ and $D=2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc for Pavo, $M_V=-10.91\pm0.10$ and $D=3.34\pm0.11$ Mpc for Corvus A, and $M_V=-12.02\pm0.12$ and $D=6.50^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ Mpc for Kamino). Our HST-derived SFHs reveal differences among the three dwarfs: Pavo and Kamino show relatively steady, continuous star formation, while Corvus A formed $\sim$$60$% of its stellar mass by 10 Gyr ago. These results align with theoretical predictions of diverse evolutionary pathways for isolated low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Life of Stars: Embedded Beginnings to AGB Endings in the PHANGS-JWST Sample. I. Catalog of Mid-IR Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength catalog of mid-infrared-selected compact sources in 19 nearby galaxies, combining JWST NIRCam/MIRI, HST UV-optical broadband, H$\alpha$ narrow-band, and ALMA CO observations. We detect 24,945 compact sources at 21 $\mu$m and 55,581 at 10 $\mu$m. Artificial star tests show 50% completeness limits of $\sim$5 $\mu$Jy for the 10 $\mu$m catalog, and $\sim$24 $\mu$Jy for the 21 $\mu$m catalog. We find that 21 $\mu$m compact sources contribute $\sim$20% of the total galaxy emission in that band, but only contribute $5%$ at 10 $\mu$m. We classify sources using stellar evolution and population synthesis models combined with empirical classifications derived from the literature.Our classifications include H$\alpha$-bright and dust-embedded optically faint clusters, red supergiants (RSGs), oxygen-rich and carbon-rich AGB stars, and a range of rarer stellar types.In sampling a broad range of star forming environments with a uniform, well-characterized selection, this catalog enables enables analyses of infrared-bright stellar populations. We find that H$\alpha$-faint sources account for only 10% of dusty (likely young) clusters, implying that the infrared-bright, optically-faint phase of cluster evolution is short compared to the H$\alpha$-bright stage. The luminosity functions of 10 and 21 $\mu$m sources follow power-law distributions, with the 21 $\mu$m slope ($-1.7 \pm 0.1$) similar to that of giant molecular cloud mass functions and ultraviolet bright star-forming complexes, while the 10 $\mu$m slope ($-2.0 \pm 0.1$) is closer to that of young stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays in Galaxy Halos: Impacts on Galactic Outflows and Baryon Cycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies with high star-formation rate surface densities often host large-scale outflows that redistribute energy, momentum, and baryons between the interstellar medium and the halo, making them a key feedback channel regulating galaxy evolution. Despite their importance, the driving physics behind galactic outflows and their interaction with the surrounding halo is yet to be fully understood. In particular, the influence of a pre-existing reservoir of cosmic rays (CRs) in galaxy halos has not been clearly established. We determine the conditions required to launch outflows in the presence of halo CRs and investigate how CR pressure gradients modify outflow speeds. We find that CR halos suppress the development of large-scale, CR-driven winds and redirect CR feedback toward local recycling flows. Slow outflows are therefore more likely in young galaxies lacking extended CR halos, while fast winds in intense starbursts are dominated by momentum injection and largely unaffected by halo CRs.</description>

      <title>Atomic and molecular gas in the Milky Way. I. Structure decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GDCluster, a fully automated algorithm for decomposing spectral-line datacube of interstellar gas into coherent structures. Assuming a multi-Gaussian nature of observed spectra, GDCluster employs and augments the derivative spectroscopy technique for precise parameter estimation, incorporates spatial-continuity constraints during spectral fitting, and extends these constraints to spatial clustering. This approach effectively resolves velocity blending structures in PPV space-particularly critical for ubiquitous HI spectra where emissions from multiple phases are severely blended. Applied to the all-sky HI4PI data, a 10 degree times 10 degree CRAFTS survey region, and a 45 degree times 10 degree MWISP survey region, GDCluster extracts 45,299, 2247, and 47,119 structures in HI and CO (1-0), respectively. Comparative analyses demonstrate GDCluster's superiority over DBSCAN in separating overlapping spectra with complex velocity components.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Axe-shaped Radio Galaxy J1051+5523 with uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-frequency study of the bent-tail radio galaxy J1051+5523, located in the galaxy cluster WHL J105147.4+552309. This wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxy exhibits a complex radio morphology, characterised by a right-angled bend in the northern jet, which resembles an axe, and multiple kinks in the southern jet, as observed in the deep uGMRT radio observations. The radio power of J1051+5523 at 150 MHz is estimated to be $2.91 \times 10^{25}\,\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1}}$, placing it in the transition zone between FRI and FRII radio galaxies. The spectral index map reveals a flat core and relatively flat lobes, which may indicate ongoing particle acceleration or a relatively young population of relativistic electrons in the lobes. Further, we estimate the equipartition magnetic fields, and spectral ages of the northern and southern lobes to be approximately 150 Myr and 153 Myr, respectively, suggesting a long-lived radio source with sustained AGN activity. A relative velocity of 278 $\pm$ 2643 $\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ is obtained for the host galaxy. Due to the large uncertainty associated with the relative velocity estimates, the contribution of ram pressure to the jet bending remains inconclusive. The low mass of the host cluster ($\sim 2 \times 10^{14}\,M_\odot$) and the lack of diffuse X-ray emission indicate a reduced likelihood of major mergers, but minor mergers or interactions remain possible. We propose that the observed WAT morphology of J1051+5523 is likely shaped by a combination of ram pressure and/or buoyant forces within the cluster environment.</description>

      <title>Tracing {\omega}Centauri's origins: Spatial and chemical signatures of its formation history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \omega}Centauri ({\omega}Cen) is the most enigmatic Galactic globular cluster (GC), with unmatched chemical complexity. We combine photometric and spectroscopic catalogs to identify its distinct stellar populations and to investigate their spatial distribution and chemical properties, uncovering new insights into the cluster's formation history. We identify the iron-poor stars commonly found in GCs: the first population (1P), with halo-like chemical composition, and the second population (2P), enriched in elements produced by p-capture processes. Similarly, we divided the iron-rich stars (the anomalous stars) into two groups: the AI and the AII, exhibiting light-element abundance distributions similar to 1P and 2P stars, respectively. The wide extension of our dataset (five times the half-light radius) allowed us to directly and unambiguously compare the fraction of these populations at different radii. We find that 2P and AII stars are more centrally concentrated than the 1P and AI. The remarkable similarities between the 1P-2P and AI-AII radial distributions strongly suggest that these two groups of stars originated from similar mechanisms. Our chemical analysis indicates that the 1P and AI stars (the lower stream) developed their inhomogeneities through core-collapse supernova (and possibly other massive stars') self-enrichment, and that these populations contributed p-capture-processed material to the intracluster medium, from which the chemically extreme 2P and AII stars (the upper stream) formed. Additional polluters, such as intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae, likely played a role in shaping the AII. Finally, we propose that 2P and AII stars with intermediate light-element abundances (the middle stream) formed via dilution between the pure ejecta that created the upper stream and lower-stream material.</description>

      <title>GTC/OSIRIS Deep Spectroscopy of Galactic Compact Planetary Nebulae: PNG048.5+04.2 and PNG068.7+14.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report deep long-slit spectroscopy of two Galactic compact planetary nebulae (PNe), PNG048.5+04.2 and PNG068.7+14.8, obtained using the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). These spectra cover a broad wavelength range of ~3630-10370 A, enabling detection of numerous emission lines critical for nebular analysis, including [O II] 3727 and [O III] 4363 in the blue and [S III] 6312,9069 in the red. Also detected in the spectrum of PNG068.7+14.8 are broad C III and C IV lines probably due to stellar emission, indicating that the central star of this PN is [WC]-type. These GTC optical-IR spectra were analyzed in details in conjunction with the archival Spitzer/IRS mid-IR spectra, and elemental abundances of the two PNe determined. Photoionization models were established for the two PNe using CLOUDY, based on the ratios of line fluxes measured from the GTC optical-NIR spectra. Our best photoionization modeling, in combination with state-of-the-art post-AGB evolutionary model tracks, shows that both PNe evolved from low-mass progenitors (&lt;2 M_sun) with relatively young ages (&lt;3 Gyr), although their central cores are probably in different evolutionary stages - the central star of PNG068.7+14.8 is still in the process of heating up, while that of PNG048.5+04.2 has already entered the white dwarf cooling track. A comparison with AGB model predictions also constrains the progenitors of both PNe to be of low masses. Moreover, the two PNe are in line with the radial oxygen gradients exhibited by the Galactic PN populations, using the most up-to-date distances.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared diagnostics for identifying main sequence galaxies in the local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A galaxy's mid-IR spectrum encodes key information on its radiation field, star formation, and dust properties. Characterizing this spectrum therefore offers strong constraints on a galaxy's activity. This project describes a diagnostic tool for identifying main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the local Universe using IR dust emission features that are characteristic of galaxy activity. A physically-motivated sample of mock galaxy spectra has been generated to simulate the IR emission of SFGs. Using this sample, we developed a diagnostic tool for identifying MS SFGs based on machine learning methods. Custom photometric bands were defined to target dust emission features, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the dust continuum. Three bands were chosen to trace PAH features at 6.2 {\mu}m, 7.7 {\mu}m, 8.6 {\mu}m, and 11.3 {\mu}m, along with an additional band to probe the radiation field strength responsible for heating the dust. This diagnostic was subsequently applied to observed galaxies to evaluate its effectiveness in real-world applications. Our diagnostic achieves high performance, with an accuracy of 90.9% on MS SFGs (observed sample of SFGs). Additionally, it shows low contamination, with only 16.2% of AGN galaxies being misidentified as SF. Combining observational data with stellar population synthesis models enables the creation of physically-motivated samples of SFGs that match the spectral properties of real galaxies. By positioning custom photometric bands targeting key dust features, our diagnostic can extract valuable information without the need to measure emission lines. Although PAHs are sensitive indicators of star formation and interstellar medium radiation hardness, PAH emission alone is insufficient for identifying MS SFGs. Finally, we developed a physically-motivated spectral library of MS SFGs spanning from UV to FIR wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Formation of unsaturated carbon chains through carbon chemisorption on solid CO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of carbon atoms with solid carbon monoxide (CO) is a fundamental process in astrochemistry, influencing the formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments. This study investigates the adsorption and reaction mechanisms of carbon atoms on solid CO under cryogenic conditions, employing a combination of experimental techniques, including photostimulated desorption and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (PSD-REMPI) and infrared spectroscopy, alongside quantum chemical calculations. The results reveal the formation of oxygenated carbon chains, such as CCO, C$_3$O$_2$, and C$_5$O$_2$, as well as CO$_2$. The findings highlight the role of chemisorption and subsequent reactions in driving molecular complexity on solid CO, with implications for the chemical evolution of interstellar ices and the potential formation of prebiotic molecules.</description>

      <title>Lensed quasars in CatNorth I. Wide-separation candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are a rare subclass of strongly lensed quasars produced by massive galaxy clusters. They provide valuable probes of dark-matter halos and quasar host galaxies. However, only about ten WSLQ systems are currently known, which limits further studies. To enlarge the sample from wide-area surveys, we developed a catalog-based pipeline and applied it to the CatNorth database, a catalog of quasar candidates constructed from Gaia DR3. CatNorth contains 1,545,514 quasar candidates with about 90% purity and a Gaia G-band limiting magnitude of roughly 21. The pipeline has three stages. First, we identify groups with separations between 10 and 72 arcsec using a HEALPix grid with 25.6 arcsec spacing and a friends-of-friends search. We then filter by intra-group color and spectral similarity, reducing the 1,545,514 sources to 14,244 groups while retaining all known, discoverable WSLQs. Finally, a visual check, guided by image geometry and the presence of likely foreground lenses, yields the candidate list with quality labels. We identify 333 new WSLQ candidates with separations from 10 to 56.8 arcsec. Using available SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 spectroscopy, we uncover two new candidate systems; the remaining 331 candidates lack sufficient spectra and are labeled as 45 grade A, 98 grade B, and 188 grade C. We also compile 29 confirmed dual quasars as a by-product. When feasible, we plan follow-up spectroscopy and deeper imaging to confirm WSLQs among these candidates and enable the related science.</description>

      <title>First large scale spatial and velocity patterns of local metal-rich stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) The present-day spatial and kinematic distribution of stars in the Milky Way provides key constraints on its internal dynamics and evolutionary history. We select stars that are more metal-rich than the interstellar medium (ISM) at their guiding radius (the so-called Local Metal-Rich stars, LMR) and investigate their chemo-kinematics. Until recently, existing catalogues did not contain such targets in large quantities, but one can now select many millions of them by using Gaia photometric metallicities. Once selected, we investigate their kinematics and age distributions across the disc, and compare them to the stellar populations having the metallicity of the ISM.
  Compared to locally born stars with [M/H]=[M/H]_ISM, we find that LMR stars, at a given location, are always older (mean age up to 2 Gyr older) and with velocity dispersions similar or slightly higher. Furthermore, at a given [M/H], LMR stars are older at larger galactocentric radiii, reflecting the fact that they need time to migrate. Finally, whereas we do not find any correlation between the location of the spiral arms and the spatial density of LMR stars, we find that the mean stellar eccentricity and mean ages show smaller values where the spiral arms are.
  Our results confirm a well established theoretical result that has not yet been formally confirmed via observations on large datasets without modelling: churning is not significantly heating the Galactic disc. Furthermore, the age distribution of these stars rule-out any significant contribution from Galactic fountains as their origin, and confirm the effect of the spiral arms on them.</description>

      <title>Investigating the influence of radio-faint AGN activity on the infrared-radio correlation of massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that star-forming galaxies (SFGs) exhibit a tight correlation between their radio and infrared emissions, commonly referred to as the infrared-radio correlation (IRRC). Recent empirical studies have reported a dependence of the IRRC on the galaxy stellar mass, in which more massive galaxies tend to show lower infrared-to-radio ratios (qIR) with respect to less massive galaxies. One possible, yet unexplored, explanation is a residual contamination of the radio emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), not captured through "radio-excess" diagnostics. To investigate this hypothesis, we aim to statistically quantify the contribution of AGN emission to the radio luminosities of SFGs located within the scatter of the IRRC. Our VLBA program "AGN-sCAN" has targeted 500 galaxies that follow the qIR distribution of the IRRC, i.e., with no prior evidence for radio-excess AGN emission based on low-resolution (~ arcsec) VLA radio imaging. Our VLBA 1.4 GHz observations reach a 5-sigma sensitivity limit of 25 microJy/beam, corresponding to a radio brightness temperature of Tb ~ 10^5 K. This classification serves as a robust AGN diagnostic, regardless of the host galaxy's star formation rate. We detect four VLBA sources in the deepest regions, which are also the faintest VLBI-detected AGN in SFGs to date. The effective AGN detection rate is 9%, when considering a control sample matched in mass and sensitivity, which is in good agreement with the extrapolation of previous radio AGN number counts. Despite the non-negligible AGN flux contamination (~ 30%) in our individual VLBA detections, we find that the peak of the qIR distribution is completely unaffected by this correction. We conclude that residual AGN contamination from non-radio-excess AGN is unlikely to be the primary driver of the M* - dependent IRRC.</description>

      <title>The GECKOS Survey: Resolved, multiphase observations of mass-loading and gas density in the galactic wind of NGC 4666</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiphase, resolved study of the galactic wind extending from the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4666. For this we use VLT/MUSE observations from the GECKOS program and HI data from the WALLABY survey. We identify both ionised and HI gas in a biconical structure extending to at least $z\sim$8 kpc from the galaxy disk, with increasing velocity offsets above the midplane in both phases, consistent with a multiphase wind. The measured electron density, using [SII], differs significantly from standard expectations of galactic winds. We find electron density declines from the galaxy centre to $\sim2$ kpc, then rises again, remaining high ($\sim100-300$ cm$^{-3}$) out to $\sim$5 kpc. We find that HI dominates the mass loading. The total HI mass outflow rate (above $z~&gt;2$ kpc) is between $5-13~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainties from disk-blurring and group interactions. The total ionised mass outflow rate (traced by H$\alpha$) is between $0.5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ and $5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, depending on $n_e(z)$ assumptions. From ALMA/ACA observations, we place an upper-limit on CO flux in the outflow which correlates to $\lesssim2.9~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$. We also show that the entire outflow is not limited to the bicone, but a secondary starburst at the edge generates a more widespread outflow, which should be included in simulations. The cool gas in NGC 4666 wind has insufficient velocity to escape the halo of a galaxy of its mass, especially because most of the mass is present in the slower atomic phase. This strong biconical wind contributes to gas cycling around the galaxy.</description>

      <title>PRIMAger General Observer programs: a {\Large $\pi$}-sr Infrared Survey and other General Observer wide-field programs</title>

Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a cryogenically-cooled, far-infrared (far-IR) observatory expected to begin serving the astronomical community by early 2030. The mission features two advanced instruments: PRIMAger and FIRESS. PRIMAger will operate across the mid- to far-IR spectrum, covering wavelengths from approximately 25 to 260 $\mu$m. It will offer hyperspectral imaging in medium resolution bands (R $\sim$ 8, using a linear variable filter) from 25 to 80 $\mu$m, and broad band (R $\sim$ 4) photometric and polarimetric imaging in four bands spanning 80 to 260 $\mu$m.
  The capabilities of PRIMAger will enable a broad range of unique scientific programs, accessible through General Observer (GO) projects.
  In this paper, we present and define a PRIMAger survey over 25\% of the sky, called $\pi$-IR survey. This survey would exploit PRIMAger's hyperspectral and polarimetric modes to collect data on about 8 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ galaxies to z $\sim$ 4. The R=8 spectral resolution of the PRIMAger Hyperspectral Imaging (PHI) filters will enable users to study the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). A large sample of galaxies will be observed with the polarimetric bands of PRIMAger, allowing unique statistical information for galaxies to be harvested for the first time.</description>

      <title>Environmental history of filament galaxies: stellar mass assembly and star-formation of filament galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy properties correlate with their position within the cosmic web. While galaxies are observed in an environment today, they may have experienced different environments in the past. The environmental history, linked to pre-processing, leaves an imprint on the properties of galaxies. We use the GAEA semi-analytic model and IllustrisTNG to reconstruct the environmental histories of galaxies between $z=0$ and $z=4$ that today reside in filaments. Our goal is to understand how galaxy properties are related to their past environments, and the role of the cosmic web in shaping their properties. We find that filament galaxies at $z=0$ are a heterogeneous mix of populations with distinct environmental histories. The vast majority of them have experienced group processing, with only $\sim$20\% remaining centrals throughout their life. For $\rm 9 &lt; \log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) &lt; 10$ galaxies, models confirm that the environmental effects are primarily driven by group processing: satellites stop growing stellar mass and exhibit elevated quenched fractions, whereas filament galaxies remain centrals have properties that are similar to field galaxies. Massive galaxies ($\rm \log_{10}(M_{star}/M_{sun}) &gt; 10$) that have never been satellites and entered filaments more than 9 Gyr ago show accelerated stellar mass assembly and higher quenched fractions relative to the field, due to a higher frequency of merger events inside filaments, even at fixed mass. The most massive $\rm \log ((M_{star} / M_{sun}) &gt; 11$) galaxies accreted onto filaments over 9 Gyr ago, highlighting the role of filaments in building up the high-mass end of the galaxy population. Filaments regulate galaxy evolution in a mass-dependent way: group environments regulate low-mass galaxies, while filaments favour the growth of massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>BASS LIV. Physical Properties of AGN-Hosting Galaxy Mergers from Multiwavelength SED Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are believed to play an important role in triggering rapid supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. As merging nuclei approach each other, the physical properties of the participating galaxies and the associated SMBH growth are expected to evolve significantly. This study measures and characterizes these physical properties throughout the merger sequence. We constructed multiwavelength Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from hard X-rays to the far-infrared (FIR) for a sample of 72 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. The sample comprises 64 interacting systems, including single AGNs in mergers and dual AGNs, with nuclear separations $\leq$30 kpc, as well as eight isolated active galaxies with merging features. We carefully adapted available photometric measurements at each wavelength to account for their complex morphologies and varying spatial resolutions, to perform SED fitting using CIGALE, aimed to derive critical physical properties. Our results reveal that merging galaxies hosting AGN(s) show deviations from the star-forming main sequence, and a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs). Both AGN activity and star formation are significantly influenced by the merger process, but these effects are more prominent in major, mass ratios $&lt;$4:1, interactions. We find that the projected nuclear separation is not a good tracer of the merger stage. Instead, morphological classification accurately assesses the merger progression. Based on this morphological analysis, late-stage mergers exhibit elevated SFRs (5.1$\times$), AGN luminosities (2.4$\times$), and nuclear obscuration (2.8$\times$) compared to earlier stages, supporting previous findings and reinforcing the link between merger-driven galaxy evolution and SMBH growth.</description>

      <title>The young stellar clusters in M51 and the impact of GMC encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the young stellar cluster population of M51 and how it is affected by encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We combine a galactic model with $N$-body simulations of 5000 unique clusters in the mass range [600 - 24000] $M_{\odot}$. We simulate each cluster twice: with ($C_R$) and without ($C_N$) tidal perturbations from the GMCs. We are able to reproduce the majority of the observed mass- and age functions. However, for the age function we see a large discrepancy for clusters with masses $\sim$ 5000 $M_{\odot}$, which is likely related to incompleteness in the observations. We find that old low-mass clusters, located close to the galactic centre, are most likely to be disrupted. The effect of GMC encounters causes a decrease in survivability by 8 per cent points for the oldest clusters with initial masses below 6000 $M_{\odot}$. For 15 clusters we find that the presence of GMCs can protect the $C_R$ clusters from the rest of the galactic tidal field and thereby cause them to retain a significantly higher fraction of stars compared to the $C N$ clusters. For clusters that are super-virialized we find that the $C_R$ clusters have a higher virial ratio compared to the $C_N$ clusters, which is a result of interactions with GMCs. We see no significant difference between the $C_R$ and $C_N$ populations, indicating that over a time period of 200 Myr the effect of the GMCs cannot be detected.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: the extensive interaction of NGC 4532 and DDO 137 with the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the pilot survey of the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Survey (WALLABY), high-resolution neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) observations of the dwarf galaxy pair NGC 4532/DDO 137 (WALLABY J123424+062511) have revealed a huge (48 kpc) bridge of gas between the two galaxies, as well as numerous arms and clouds which connect with the even longer (0.5 Mpc) tail of gas previously discovered with the Arecibo telescope. Our modelling suggests that a combination of ram pressure and tidal forces are responsible for the nature of the system. Although the pair lies well outside of the virial radius of the Virgo cluster, ram pressure due to infall through an extensive envelope of hot gas around the cluster is most likely responsible for the HI tail. Over a timescale of 1 Gyr, the predicted electron density ($1.2\times 10^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and infall velocity (880 km s$^{-1}$) are probably sufficient to explain the extensive stripping from the common gaseous envelope of NGC 4532/DDO 137. The ongoing tidal interaction with the Virgo cluster appears to have prevented a rapid merger of the binary pair, with the mutual tidal interaction between the galaxy pair being responsible for raising gas from the outer parts of the galaxy potential wells into the HI bridge and common envelope. The NGC 4532/DDO 137 system mirrors many of the physical features of the Magellanic System, and may lead to a better understanding of that system, as well as casting more light on the relative importance of interaction mechanisms in the outskirts of dynamically young galaxy clusters such as Virgo.</description>

      <title>JADES: the chemical enrichment pattern of distant galaxies - silicon depletion and iron enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present gas-phase abundances of carbon (C), $\alpha$-elements (O, Ne, Si, and Ar) and iron (Fe) obtained from stacked spectra of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies with the deep Near Infrared Spectrograph medium-resolution data from the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. Our 564 sources at $z=4$--7 have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=8.46$ and a median star-formation rate of $\log(\mathrm{SFR}/M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}})=0.30$, placing them close to the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our 564 sources has relatively low [C/O]$=-0.70$, moderate [Ne/O]$=-0.09$, and low [Ar/O]$=-0.28$ values at a low gas-phase metallicity of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.71$ ($Z\sim 0.1~Z_\odot$), suggesting dominant yields of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of [Si/O]$=-0.63$, which is lower than that of stars in the Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than that we newly derive for two individual $z&gt;6$ galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248) with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of $M_{*}$, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope $\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin and the blue-$\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$ bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O enhancement at the very early epoch of star formation.</description>

      <title>NICER observations reveal doubled timescales in Ansky's quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring X-ray bursts originating from the vicinity of supermassive black holes, but their driving mechanisms remain under debate. This study analyzes new NICER observations of QPEs in Ansky (a transient event in the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J1335+0728), taken between January and June 2025. By examining flare durations, peak-to-peak recurrence times, and profiles, we compare the 2025 data with those from 2024 to investigate changes in energy, timescales, and flare shapes. The 2025 QPEs are found to be four times more energetic, with recurrence times of approximately 10 days and flare durations ranging from 2.5 to 4 days, making them both about twice as long as in 2024. Additionally, the flare profiles have become more asymmetric, showing longer decays. We explore different theoretical scenarios to explain the observed properties of the QPEs in Ansky, including evolving stream-disk interactions in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system as a potential mechanism behind the observed changes in recurrence time and energetics, while also considering alternative models based on mass transfer and accretion disk instabilities. Continued observational efforts will be crucial for unveiling the nature of Ansky.</description>

      <title>A joint 1% calibration of the RR Lyrae &amp; type-II Cepheid Leavitt laws yields homogeneous distances to 93 Galactic globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has established large samples of astrometrically confirmed RR Lyrae and type-II Cepheid members of Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Any given GC can contain multiple such stars at once, notably RR Lyrae stars pulsating in the fundamental mode (RRab) or the first overtone (RRc), and type-II Cepheids (T2Cep) of BL Her and W Vir types. Here, we present the first joint calibration of the Leavitt laws (LLs) exhibited by 802 RRab, 345 RRc, and 21 T2Cep stars anchored to trigonometric parallaxes. Using the third data release of the ESA Gaia mission (GDR3), we have calibrated the intercepts of the RRab and RRc Leavitt laws in the reddening-free Gaia Wesenheit magnitude to better than 1.0% in distance, and that of T2Cep to 1.3%, using a global fit to all data. The absolute scale is set by 37 nearby GCs with high-accuracy parallaxes while 56 additional GCs provide constraints on LL slopes as well as the LL intercept differences of RRc and T2Cep relative to RRab stars. Our global fit yields homogeneous high-accuracy distances of 93 GCs that show no evidence of bias for Gaia parallaxes of distant GCs. Control of systematics was demonstrated by 31 alternative fit variants, notably involving different treatments of metallicity effects, as well as by Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results suggest that photometric metallicities of RR Lyrae stars require further improvements while also exhibiting possible signs of intra-cluster chemical inhomogeneity. This work lays the foundation for exploiting RRab, RRc, and T2Cep stars as high-accuracy standard candles for near-field cosmology and the extragalactic distance scale.</description>

      <title>A New Subclass of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars at Extremely Low Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new subclass of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, characterized by high absolute carbon abundances (A(C) &gt; 7.39) and extremely low metallicity ([Fe/H] $&lt;=$ -3.1) but notably lacking enhancements in neutron-capture elements, thus falling under the CEMP-no category. This population emerged from a detailed analysis of low-resolution spectroscopic data obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), where the observed frequency trends with the decreasing metallicity of CEMP-s (s-process-enhanced) and CEMP-no (no neutron-capture enhanced) stars deviated from established expectations. In contrast to earlier findings, we observe a rise in high-A(C) stars below [Fe/H] = -3.1, which we interpret as a distinct group not accounted for in traditional CEMP classifications. Following the Yoon-Beers group classification, we define these stars as Group IV. Statistical modeling confirms their presence as a separate peak in the A(C) distribution, and available radial velocity data suggest that about 30% of Group IV stars may be binaries, indicating possible binary-related formation mechanisms. This discovery challenges the current CEMP-no star formation pathways and implies the existence of alternative or hybrid enrichment scenarios in the early Universe. High-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of Group IV candidates will be crucial for identifying their progenitors and understanding their evolutionary implications.</description>

      <title>Reverberation lags viewed in hard X-rays from an accreting stellar-mass black hole</title>

Abstract: Accreting black holes are thought to swallow matter in the form of a disk and a hot cloud of plasma that glows brightly in X-rays, known as the corona. The X-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid variability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring time lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal X-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation lags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron emission line at $\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\sim 30$ keV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, it is much more challenging to detect reverberation lags from stellar-mass black holes because they are more than a million times smaller. Previous reverberation lag measurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus been limited to energies below 10 keV. Here we report on the first detection of the Compton hump reverberation feature from an X-ray binary, achieved by measuring lags in the broad energy range of $\sim 1-150$ keV. The accompanying detection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation and provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray binaries are governed by an ubiquitous process. Reverberation lags are prominent only in the most rapid variability, whereas lags in the slower variability are commonly attributed to propagating mass accretion rate perturbations. Our lag measurements up to the highest energy to date reveal that this lag in the slower variability evolves dramatically on timescales of days.</description>

      <title>Binary black holes in magnetized AGN disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers occurring within the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational waves detectable by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) interferometers. Some of these events have also been potentially associated with transient electromagnetic flares, indicating that BBH mergers in dense environments may be promising sources of multi-messenger signals. To investigate the prospects for electromagnetic emission from these systems, we study the dynamics of accretion flows onto BBHs embedded in AGN disks using numerical simulations. Although recent studies have explored this scenario, they often employ simplified disk models that neglect magnetic fields. In this work, we examine how strong magnetic fields influence and regulate the accretion onto such binary systems. In this context, we conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical local shearing-box simulations of a binary black hole system embedded within a magnetized disk of an AGN.
  We observe that the dynamically important magnetic fields can drive the formation of well-collimated outflows capable of penetrating the vertical extent of the AGN disk. However, outflow generation is not ubiquitous and strongly depends on the radial distance of the binary from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In particular, binaries placed at a larger distance from the central SMBH show relatively more transient accretion and the formation of stronger spiral shocks. Furthermore, accretion behavior onto the binary system via individual circum-singular disks (CSDs) is also modulated by local AGN disk properties. Our simulations highlight the importance of shear velocity in the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field component, which plays a crucial role in governing the outflow strength.</description>

      <title>Population-Dependent r-process Scatter in the Globular Cluster M15</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple populations, defined by correlations between light element abundances, are an almost ubiquitous property of globular clusters. On the other hand, dispersions among the heavy elements are limited to a few rare clusters. In this letter, we present Mg, Y, Ba, La, and Eu measurements for 89 stars in M15 with errors &lt; 0.4 dex from Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectra. We find higher Ba, La, and Eu dispersions in the first generation of stars than in the second generation at a significance of $\ge$2 $\sigma$. This is evidence for inhomogeneous mixing of gas during the formation of the first generation of stars, which subsequently became well-mixed prior to the formation of the second generation of stars. If the r-process event that caused the abundance dispersions was born with the first population of stars, it must be an r-process site with a short delay time.</description>

      <title>A novel Reverberation mapping method for blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reverberation mapping (RM) is the most promising method to measure the mass of supermassive black hole in the center of active galaxy nuclei (AGNs). However, the dominant jet component hinders the application of RM method for blazars. In this work, we present a new algorithm to disentangle the contributions of the accretion disk and relativistic jet in blazars by analyzing the optical spectroscopic data. Applying this method to two flat-spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089 and PKS 0736+017, we find that the H$\gamma$ variability in PKS 1510-089 lags behind the disk by approximately 116 days, while the H$\beta$ line exhibits a lag of about 52 days relative to the disk in PKS 0736+017. Based on these measured time lags, we estimate that the black hole masses are about $1.8 \times 10^8\ M_\odot$ for PKS 1510-089 and about $7.0 \times 10^7\ M_\odot$ for PKS 0736+017, respectively. This method paves the way to apply the RM method for blazars, and improves the understanding of disk and jet activities.</description>

      <title>The changing look of the neutrino-emitter blazar candidate 5BZQ J1243+4043</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. In recent years, changing-look blazars have put into question the traditional BL Lacs-flat spectrum radio quasars empirical classification of blazars based on the intensity of optical spectral lines, as they appear to transition between the two classes over time. Aims. We focus on the blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043, recently proposed as a promising candidate for the emission of high-energy neutrinos observed by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and reported as a changing look in the literature. We study the spectral properties of this blazar, inferring its radiation field and accretion regime properties among different epochs. Methods. This study presents new optical spectroscopy observations of 5BZQ J1243+4043 taken with the Gran Telescopio Canarias. We use this new dataset and two optical spectra available from the literature to investigate the continuum and line emissions and pinpoint the physical properties of the source. Results. The newly collected data for 5BZQ J1243+4043 shows broad emission lines, consistent with the spectrum of the first epoch and the redshift $z = 1.5181\pm0.0002$ known from the literature. For the second epoch, the spectrum appears featureless, and we place limits on the emission lines and related physical properties. We observe spectral variability for both the continuum and line emissions among the three spectra. Despite this, the accretion properties of the blazar remain, overall, unvaried, indicating that the intrinsic physics remains the same across the three epochs. In the broader multi-messenger context, this suggests that, despite the changing look in the optical band, the candidate neutrino-emitter blazar 5BZQ J1243+4043 remains characterized by the presence of intense external radiation fields and radiatively efficient accretion, typical of high-excitation radio galaxies, that may foster neutrino production.</description>

      <title>Volume Density Mapper: 3D Density Reconstruction Algorithm for Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) exhibits complex, multi-scale structures that are challenging to study due to their projection into two-dimensional (2D) column density maps. We present the Volume Density Mapper, a novel algorithm based on constrained diffusion to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) density distributions of molecular clouds from 2D observations. This method decomposes the column density into multi-scale components, reconstructing a 3D density field that preserves key physical properties such as mean density, maximum density, and standard deviation along the line of sight. Validated against numerical simulations (FLASH and ENZO), the algorithm achieves high accuracy, with mean density estimates within 0.1 dex and dispersions of 0.2 to 0.3 dex across varied cloud structures. The reconstructed 3D density fields enable the derivation of critical parameters, including volume density, cloud thickness, and density probability distribution functions, offering insights into star formation and ISM evolution. The versatility of the method is demonstrated by applying diverse systems from galaxies (NGC 628) to protostellar disks. The code is available at https://github.com/gxli/volume-density-mapper.</description>

We construct a consistence thermodynamics for the Taub-NUT-like BH and determine its thermodynamic topological class. The Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the mass and temperature of the BH but does not its thermodynamic topological classification.</description>

      <title>The origin of the intra-cluster light in The Three Hundred simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the origin and formation mechanisms of the intra-cluster light (ICL) in The Three Hundred simulations, a set of 324 hydrodynamically resimulated massive galaxy clusters. The ICL, a diffuse component of stars not bound to individual galaxies, serves as a key tracer of cluster formation and evolution. Using two hydrodynamics implementations, Gadget-X and Gizmo-Simba, we identify the stellar particles comprising the ICL at z=0 and trace them back in time to the moments when they were formed and accreted into the ICL. Across our 324 clusters, half of the present-day ICL mass is typically in place between $z \sim $ 0.2 and 0.5. The main ICL formation channel is the stripping of stars from subhalos after their infall into the host cluster. Within this channel, 65-80 per cent of the ICL comes from objects with stellar (infall) masses above $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, i.e., massive galaxies, groups and clusters. Considering the ratio of the infalling halo to the total cluster mass, a median of 35 per cent of the mass is brought in major merger events, though this percentage varies significantly across clusters (15-55 per cent). Additional contributions come from minor mergers (25-35 per cent) and smooth accretion (20-50 per cent). The primary contributors typically infall at $z \leq 1$, with smaller fractions arriving at redshifts between 1 and 2. Regarding other formation channels, we find minor contributions from stars formed in subhalos after their infall and stars stripped while their contributing halo remains outside the host cluster (and can eventually fall inside or stay outside). Finally, for our two sets of simulations, we find medians of 12 (Gadget-X) and 2 (Gizmo-Simba) per cent of the ICL mass formed in-situ, that is, directly as part of the diffuse component. However, this component can be attributed to stripping of gas in high-velocity infalling satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Star-forming galaxies in the cosmic web in the last 11 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their position within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies, robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament. After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate (SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion, reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances ($\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores, suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms dominating across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>DESI Strong Lens Foundry IV: Spectroscopic Confirmation of DESI Lens Candidates with VLT/MUSE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present integral field spectroscopic observations of 75 strong gravitational lens candidates identified with a residual neural network in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the ESO's Very Large Telescope. These observations are part of an ongoing effort to build a large, spectroscopically confirmed sample of strong lensing systems for studies on dark matter, galaxy structure, and cosmology. Our MUSE program targets both lens and source redshifts, with particular emphasis on southern hemisphere systems. MUSE's wide spectral coverage and integral field capability allow for efficient identification of multiple sources, lens environments, and weak spectral features. Redshifts for lenses and sources were obtained via manual identification of spectral features in extracted 1D spectra. Our dataset includes systems with complex configurations, such as multiple source planes and group or cluster-scale environments. We extracted and analyzed 185 spectra, successfully determining both the lens and the source redshifts for 48 gravitational lens systems. For an additional 21 targets, we measured the redshifts of the lenses but were unable to determine the redshifts of the background sources. Six targets were confirmed to not be gravitational lenses. The results presented here complement space-based imaging from our HST SNAPshot program and spectroscopic follow-up with DESI and Keck, and have lasting legacy value for identifying interesting high-redshift sources and complex lensing configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic data of strong lenses and their source galaxies using the Keck Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrometer (NIRES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), providing redshifts necessary for nearly all strong-lensing applications with these systems, especially the extraction of physical parameters from lensing modeling. These strong lenses were found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) and followed up by our Hubble Space Telescope program, with all systems displaying unambiguous lensed arcs. With NIRES, we target eight lensed sources at redshifts difficult to measure in the optical range and determine the source redshifts for six, between $z_s$ = 1.675 and 3.332. DESI observed one of the remaining source redshifts, as well as an additional source redshift within the six systems. The two systems with non-detections by NIRES were observed for a considerably shorter 600s at high airmass. Combining NIRES infrared spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy from our DESI Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program, these results provide the complete lens and source redshifts for six systems, a resource for refining automated strong lens searches in future deep- and wide-field imaging surveys and addressing a range of questions in astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program. This is a spectroscopic follow-up program for strong gravitational lens candidates found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys footprint. Spectroscopic redshifts for the lenses and lensed source are crucial for lens modeling to obtain physical parameters. The spectroscopic catalog in this paper consists of 73 candidate systems from the DESI Early Data Release (EDR). We have confirmed 20 strong lensing systems and determined four to not be lenses. For the remaining systems, more spectroscopic data from ongoing and future observations will be presented in future publications. We discuss the implications of our results for lens searches with neural networks in existing and future imaging surveys as well as for lens modeling. This Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program is part of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry project, and this is Paper II of a series on this project.</description>

      <title>Challenging the AGN scenario for JWST/NIRSpec LRD and non-LRD broad H$\alpha$ emitters in light of non-detection of NIRCam photometric variability and X-ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered a substantial population of high-$z$ ($z \gtrsim 4$) galaxies exhibiting broad H$\alpha$ emission line with a Full Width at Half Maximum exceeding 1,000 km/s. This population consists of a well-known subset called Little Red Dots (LRDs) and the remaining non-LRDs. If all of these broad H$\alpha$ emitters were attributed to type $1-1.9$ Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), it would imply a significantly higher number density of low-luminosity AGNs than extrapolated from that of more luminous AGNs. Here, we have examined the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)-optical flux variability of three LRD and two non-LRD broad H$\alpha$ emitters using multi-epoch, multi-band JWST/NIRCam imaging data. The rest-frame temporal sampling interval of the NIRCam data ($\sim 400-500$~days$/(1+z)$) is comparable to typical variability timescales of AGNs with black hole (BH) masses of $M_{\text{BH}} \sim 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$; thus, the flux variations should be detectable if AGNs were present. However, no measurable flux variation over the rest-frame wavelength range of $\lambda_{\text{rest}} \sim 1,500-9,000${\AA} has been detected, placing stringent upper limits on the variability amplitudes. This result, combined with the X-ray faintness confirmed by the ultra-deep Chandra data, indicates that, under the AGN scenario, we need to postulate peculiar Compton-thick broad-line AGNs with either ($a$) an intrinsically non-variable AGN disk continuum, ($b$) a host galaxy-dominated continuum, or ($c$) scattering-dominated AGN emission. Alternatively, ($d$) they could be non-AGNs where the broad-line emission originates from unusually fast and dense/low-metallicity star-formation-driven outflows or inelastic Raman scattering of stellar UV continua by neutral hydrogen atoms.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of rotation curves and spatially integrated HI flux profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolved rotation curves (RCs) are the gold-standard measurements for inferring dark matter distributions in $\Lambda$CDM and testing alternative theories of dynamics in galaxies. However they are expensive to obtain, making them prohibitive for large galaxy samples and at higher redshift. Spatially integrated HI flux profiles are more accessible and present the information in a different form, but -- except in a highly compressed form, as linewidths -- have not so far been compared in detail with RCs or employed for dynamical inferences. Here we study the consistency of RCs and HI surface density profiles from SPARC with spatially integrated HI flux profiles from ALFALFA, by combining the resolved properties in a forward model for the flux profile. We define a new metric for asymmetry in the flux profiles, enabling us to cleanly identify those unsuitable for our axisymmetric method. Among all SPARC galaxies the agreement between RCs and flux profiles is satisfactory within the limitations of the data -- with most galaxies having an uncertainty normalised mean squared error (MSE) below 10 -- while no galaxy deemed symmetric has a MSE above 1.2. Most cases of good agreement prefer a HI gas dispersion $\sigma_{\mathrm{HI}}$ of ~13 km/s, consistent with resolved studies of gas dispersion from the literature. These results open the door for spatially integrated HI flux profiles to be used as proxies for spatially resolved dynamics, including a robust appraisal of the degree of asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Physical Processes Behind the Co-Evolution of Halos, Galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes in the IllustrisTNG Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the co-evolution of dark matter halos, their central galaxies, and central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using the IllustrisTNG (TNG) simulation. We find that the evolutionary histories of individual galaxies in the $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ plane can be decomposed into four distinct phases, separated by three transition points. We identify the driving processes of galaxy evolution within each phase and derive the conditions necessary and sufficient for transitions to subsequent phases. The first phase is dominated by star formation, with its duration primarily determined by the mass of the SMBH seed and the surrounding gas environment. The second phase is characterized by rapid SMBH growth, and the transition to the next phase occurs when the thermal-mode feedback of active galactic nucleus (AGN) can unbind gas from the galaxy. The third phase involves self-regulation of the SMBH, and the transition to the quenched phase occurs when the kinetic-mode feedback of AGN counterbalances gas cooling within the subhalo. The final phase is dominated by mergers. We investigate the use of scaling relations among different mass components and evolutionary phases to understand processes implemented in TNG and other simulations, and discuss how current and forthcoming observations can be used to constrain models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scales of Galaxies from Self-interacting Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the characteristic scales for physical quantities of dwarf galaxies, such as mass, size, acceleration, and angular momentum, within the self-interacting ultralight dark matter (ULDM) model. Due to the small mass of ULDM, even minor self-interactions can drastically alter these scales in the Thomas-Fermi limit. We suggest that these characteristic scales are connected to mysteries of observed galaxies. Oscillation of ULDM field can explain the current cosmological density of dark matter. Many cosmological constraints suggest that the energy scale $\tilde{m}$ for self-interacting ULDM is typically of the order $10~eV$, whereas the mass $m$ for the non-interacting case is around $10^{-21}~eV$. Self-interacting ULDM provides the better explanation for cosmological observations than the non-interacting case.</description>

      <title>In-situ vs. ex-situ drivers of galaxy quenching: critical black hole mass and main sequence universality in the FLAMINGO simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploiting a large sample of 5.3 million galaxies with $M_\ast\,{=}\,10^{10-11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ from the highest-resolution FLAMINGO simulation, we carry out a statistical analysis of quiescent and star-forming galaxies to explore quenching mechanisms. From redshift $z\,{\simeq}\,7$ to 0, we find that the median star-formation rate of main-sequence galaxies is independent of the environment and of whether a galaxy is a central or satellite, whereas the fraction of quiescent galaxies is highly sensitive to both. By employing Random Forest (RF) classifiers, we demonstrate that black hole (BH) feedback is the most responsible quenching mechanism for both centrals and satellites, while halo mass is the second most significant. For satellites, a notable importance given by RF to stellar mass implies in-situ pre-quenching rather than ex-situ preprocessing prior to infall to the current host halo. In the cosmic afternoon of $z\,{=}\,$0\,--\,1, we identify two distinct regimes of evolution: at $M_{\rm BH}\,{\gtrsim}\,10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$, essentially all galaxies are quenched regardless of their environment; at $M_{\rm BH}\,{\lesssim}\,10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$, quenching is determined mainly by halo mass. Galaxies undergo a sharp transition from the main sequence to quiescence once their BH mass reaches $M_{\rm BH}\,{\simeq}\,10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$ (typically when $M_\ast\,{\simeq}\,10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm h}\,{\simeq}\,10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) with a short quenching timescale of ${&lt;}$\,1\,Gyr. This transition is driven by a sudden change in the gas mass in the inner circum-galactic medium. Our results indicate that galaxy quenching arises from a combination of in-situ and ex-situ physical processes.</description>

      <title>The effect of dynamical states on galaxy clusters populations. II. Comparison of galaxy properties and fundamental relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution. The role of cluster dynamical states in shaping the physical and morphological properties of member galaxies remains an open question. We aim to assess the impact of the dynamical state of massive ($M_{500} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters on the physical and structural properties of their member galaxies, and also in their fundamental relations in the redshift range $0.10 &lt; z &lt; 0.35$. We use a mass-matched sample of galaxies from relaxed and disturbed clusters. Morphological types were assigned using both parametric and nonparametric methods, while physical properties were derived through SED fitting. Galaxies were further divided into subpopulations to investigate trends with cluster dynamical states. The dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not alter their fundamental relations at low redshift (such as color-magnitude, mass-size, morphology-density, and SF-density relations), nor does it significantly affect the mean or dispersion of galaxy properties. However, it does impact the distributions at the level of third- and fourth-order moments, introducing asymmetries and heavier tails in the properties of galaxies. The greatest effects are observed in the sSFRs of low-mass and red sequence galaxies. These findings suggest that, at low redshift, the fundamental relations of massive galaxy clusters are already well established and resilient to recent dynamical activity. Nonetheless, the influence of the dynamical state on the higher-order moments of galaxy properties indicates that environmental processes associated with disturbed clusters still leave measurable imprints, particularly on low-mass and red sequence galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that galaxy evolution is shaped both by early pre-processing and by subsequent interactions within dynamically active environments.</description>

      <title>Toward A General Theory of Grain Alignment and Disruption by Radiative Torques and Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.</description>

      <title>Assessing the connection between galactic conformity and assembly-type bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Galaxies in the Universe show a conformity in the fraction of quenched galaxies out to large distances, being much larger around quenched central galaxies than for star-forming ones. On the other hand, simulations have shown that the clustering of halos and the galaxies within them depends on secondary properties other than halo mass, a phenomenon termed assembly bias. Aims. Our aim is to study whether samples that show galactic conformity also show assembly bias and to see if the amplitude of these two effects is correlated. Methods. We use synthetic galaxies at $z = 0$ from the semi-analytical model SAG run on the MultiDark Planck 2 (MDPL2) cosmological simulation and measure both conformity and galaxy assembly bias for different samples of central galaxies at fixed host halo mass. We focus on central galaxies hosted by low-mass halos of 10$^{11.6}$ $\leq$ $M_{\rm h}$/$h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ $&lt;$ 10$^{11.8}$ because it is a mass range where the assembly bias has been reported to be strong. The samples of central galaxies are separated according to their specific star formation rate and stellar age. Results. We find that the level of conformity shown by our different samples is correlated with the level of assembly bias measured for them. We also find that removing central galaxies around massive halos diminishes the conformity signal and lowers the amount of assembly bias. Conclusions. The high correlation in the amplitude of conformity and assembly bias for different samples with and without removing galaxies near massive halos clearly indicates the strong relationship between both phenomena.</description>

      <title>Variability in the supermassive black hole binary candidate SDSS J2320+0024: No evidence of periodic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SBHBs) are a natural outcome of galaxy mergers, and they are expected to be among the loudest gravitational-wave sources at low frequencies. The source SDSS J2320+0024 was recently proposed as a promising SBHB candidate due to a possible periodicity in its light curve and variability in the MgII emission line. In this work, we reanalysed the optical (g, r, and i bands) light curves of J2320+0024 within the framework of Bayesian model selection. When periodicity was searched for together with red noise, analysis of the g-band light curve reveals a peak in the posterior of the period at ~290 days. The posterior profile is too broad to yield a preference for periodic models over models that include only red noise. Furthermore, the same peak is not present in the analysis of the r-band and i-band light curve. A periodic model without red noise identified a different (~1100 days) periodicity, but this model is statistically significantly disfavoured relative to the other models tested. In summary, we find no significant evidence in favour of a true periodic signal over red-noise variability. Our analysis questions the robustness of the previously proposed periodicity and emphasises the importance of rigorous statistical treatment. While our findings challenge the binary interpretation for J2320+0024, they do not rule it out. A statistically robust joint analysis of the photometric light curves and evolving broad-line profiles would shed further light on the true nature of this object.</description>

      <title>A new classification of ex-situ and in-situ Galactic globular clusters based on a method trained on Milky Way analogues in the TNG50 cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method combining existing cosmological simulations and orbital integration to study the hierarchical assembly of globular cluster (GC) populations in the Milky Way (MW). Our method models the growth and evolution of GC populations across various galactic environments as well as the dynamical friction and mass-loss experienced by these objects. This allows us to follow the trajectory of $\sim$18,000 GCs over cosmic time in 198 MW-like galaxies from TNG50. This cosmological-scale tracking of the dynamics of in-situ and ex-situ GC populations with such a large statistical sample allows us to confirm the presence of an overlap between the two populations in MW-like galaxies, occurring below an energy threshold of $E &lt; -0.7 |E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})|$ where $E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ is the energy of a circular orbit at the galaxy's stellar half-mass radius $r_{\rm hm}^{*}$. Our results challenge the validity of current classification schemes commonly adopted in the literature, which ultimately fail to provide a clear separation between the two populations. Instead, they tend to isolate only a subset of the ex-situ GCs. More precisely, we argue that it is highly unlikely to find in-situ clusters at $E &gt; -0.7 |E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})|$, and that the real challenge lies in distinguishing the two populations below this energy threshold. In this context, we provide new predictions regarding the origins of the MW GCs observed with Gaia, as well as a comparison with existing literature. Additionally, we highlight that even if ex-situ clusters share a common origin, they inevitably lose their dynamical coherence in the $E$-$L_{z}$ space within MW-like galaxies. We observe a dispersion of GC groups as a function of $E$ and $L_{z}$, primarily driven by the evolution of the galactic potential over time and by dynamical friction, respectively.</description>

      <title>MIRACLE II: Unveiling the multi-phase gas interplay in the circumnuclear region of NGC 1365 via multi-cloud modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases.
  MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material.
  The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions.
  Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.
  For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.</description>

      <title>Very bright, very blue, and very red: JWST CAPERS analysis of highly luminous galaxies with extreme UV slopes at $\mathbf{z = 10}$</title>

Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM observations of three luminous ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-20$) galaxies at $z\sim10$ observed with the CAPERS Cycle 3 program. These galaxies exhibit extreme UV slopes compared to typical galaxies at $z=10$. Of the three sources, two of them are a close pair (0.22 - arcsec) of blue galaxies at $z=9.800\pm0.003$ and $z=9.808\pm0.002$ with UV slopes of $\beta=-2.87\pm0.15$ and $\beta=-2.46\pm0.10$ respectively, selected from PRIMER COSMOS NIRCam imaging. We perform spectrophotometric modeling of the galaxies which suggests extremely young stellar ages and a lack of dust attenuation. For the bluest galaxy, its UV slope also suggests significant Lyman continuum escape. In contrast, the third source (selected from CEERS NIRCam imaging) at $z=9.942\pm0.002$ exhibits a red UV slope with $\beta=-1.51\pm0.08$. We rule out the possibility of a strong nebular continuum due to the lack of a Balmer jump and find no evidence to support the presence of active galactic nucleus continuum due to a lack of strong UV emission lines and no broad component to H$\gamma$ or H$\beta$. Instead, it is most likely that the red UV slope is due to dust-reddening ($A_{\rm V}\simeq0.9$) implying a significant level of dust-obscured star-formation only $\simeq480\, \rm Myr$ after the Big Bang. Under standard assumptions for dust attenuation, EGS-25297 would be the most intrinsically UV-luminous galaxy ($M_{\mathrm{UV,corr}}\simeq -22.4^{+0.7}_{-1.1}$) yet spectroscopically confirmed at $z \sim 10$. This work highlights that luminous galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ have a diversity of dust properties and that spectroscopy of these galaxies is essential to fully understand star-formation at $z\gtrsim10$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Classification of COSMOS2020 Galaxies: Quiescent vs. Star-Forming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03039v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately distinguishing between quiescent and star-forming galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution. Traditional methods, such as spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, can be computationally expensive and may struggle to capture complex galaxy properties. This study aims to develop a robust and efficient machine learning (ML) classification method to identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies within the Farmer COSMOS2020 catalog. We utilized JWST wide-field light cones from the Santa Cruz semi-analytical modeling framework to train a supervised ML model, the CatBoostClassifier, using 28 color features derived from 8 mutual photometric bands within the COSMOS catalog. The model was validated against a testing set and compared to the SED-fitting method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and execution time. Preprocessing steps included addressing missing data, injecting observational noise, and applying a magnitude cut (ch1 &lt; 26 AB) along with a redshift range of 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 to align the simulated and observational datasets. The ML method achieved an F1-score of 89\% for quiescent galaxies, significantly outperforming the SED-fitting method, which achieved 54%. The ML model demonstrated superior recall (88% vs. 38%) while maintaining comparable precision. When applied to the COSMOS2020 catalog, the ML model predicted a systematically higher fraction of quiescent galaxies across all redshift bins within 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 compared to traditional methods like NUVrJ and SED-fitting. This study shows that ML, combined with multi-wavelength data, can effectively identify quiescent and star-forming galaxies, providing valuable insights into galaxy evolution. The trained classifier and full classification catalog are publicly available.</description>

      <title>The dependence of the Type Ia Supernova colour-luminosity relation on their host galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($&gt;3\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.</description>

      <title>Two-phase formation of galaxies: the coevolution between galaxies and dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the co-evolution between Milky Way-size galaxies and their host dark matter halos. We find that the formation of these galaxies follows a two-phase pattern, with an early phase featured by hot dynamics, bulge-dominated structure and bursty star formation, and a later phase featured by cold dynamics, disk-dominated structure and steady star formation. The transition times of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the host halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase assembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical origin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation: a scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams associated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars form at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated gas when halo assembly is about to slow down. Cold gaseous and stellar disks can form only when the conditions of the two modes are removed by the stall of halo assembly and the reduction of gas by feedback processes. The two modes of star formation leave distinct imprints on the structural properties of high-redshift galaxies, providing implications to be tested by JWST and future observations.</description>

      <title>Accretion-Driven Squeezing of Fuzzy Dark Matter Halo Cores in the Schr\"odinger-Newton Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of accretion onto supermassive black holes on the density profiles of a fuzzy dark matter soliton core at the center of a dark matter halo. Treating the supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy as a point mass, we numerically solve the Schr\"odinger-Newton equation for the scalar field. We find that the time-dependent perturbation has a significant squeezing effect on the soliton density profile, which both reduces the size of the core and increases the central density. This finding provides insights into how black hole growth influences fuzzy dark matter structures, potentially addressing discrepancies in galactic core observations.</description>

      <title>ATOMIUM: Continuum emission and evidence of dust enhancement from binary motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) account for a significant portion of the dust and chemical enrichment in their host galaxy. Here we present ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.24 mm around a sample of 17 stars from the ATOMIUM survey. From our analysis of the stellar contributions to the continuum flux, we find that the semi-regular variables all have smaller physical radii and fainter monochromatic luminosities than the Mira variables. Comparing these properties with pulsation periods, we find a positive trend between stellar radius and period only for the Mira variables with periods above 300 days and a positive trend between the period and the monochromatic luminosity only for the red supergiants and the most extreme AGB stars with periods above 500 days. We find that the continuum emission at 1.2 mm can be classified into four groups. "Featureless" continuum emission is confined to the (unresolved) regions close to the star for five stars in our sample, relatively uniform extended flux is seen for four stars, tentative elongated features are seen for three stars, and the remaining five stars have unique or unusual morphological features in their continuum maps. These features can be explained by binary companions to 10 out of the 14 AGB stars in our sample. Based on our results we conclude that there are two modes of dust formation: well established pulsation-enhanced dust formation and our newly proposed companion-enhanced dust formation. If the companion is located close to the AGB star, in the wind acceleration region, then additional dust formed in the wake of the companion can increase the mass lost through the dust driven wind. This explains the different dust morphologies seen around our stars and partly accounts for a large scatter in literature mass-loss rates, especially among semiregular stars with small pulsation periods.</description>

      <title>Evidence that Mass Loss on the Red Giant Branch Decreases with Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) influences stellar evolution, properties of stellar populations, and Galactic chemical enrichment, yet remains poorly constrained observationally. Current models provide limited insight into how stellar properties, particularly how metallicity and mass, affect RGB mass loss. Here, I introduce a new observational approach that uses the age-velocity-dispersion relation and the lower-mass boundary of red giants as precise evolutionary markers. These markers, informed by Galactic evolution, allow us to construct observational isochrones for field stars. By comparing masses of RGB stars and red clump (RC) stars at the same age in the Kepler sample, I derive empirical measurements of integrated RGB mass loss at several points in age and metallicity. Combining these new observational measurements with open-cluster studies, I showed that the integrated mass loss on the RGB decreases with metallicity, and may also decrease with stellar mass. The average mass-loss rate, which accounts for RGB lifetimes and the initial mass differences between RGB and RC stars at the same age, also shows a similar trend. These findings challenge current mass-loss prescriptions widely adopted in stellar evolutionary models, since none of them is able to produce the observed mass-loss trend without widely adjusting free parameters. This highlights an urgent need to revise mechanisms that govern RGB mass loss.</description>

      <title>A dense dark matter core of the subhalo in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.</description>
