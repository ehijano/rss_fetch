      <title>Early evolution of spin direction in dark matter halos and the effect of the surrounding large-scale tidal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is usually assumed that the angular momentum (AM) of dark matter halos arises during the linear stages of structure formation, as a consequence of the coupling between the proto-haloes' shape and the tidal field produced by their surrounding density perturbations. This approach, known as linear tidal torque theory (TTT), has been shown to make fairly good predictions about the mean evolution of both the AM amplitude and orientation up to approximately the time when the proto-haloes collapse. After this point, proto-haloes are increasingly affected by non-linear processes that are not taken into account by the model. However, it has been seen in numerical simulations that, even at very early stages, the AM of proto-haloes is systematically reoriented towards perpendicularity with respect to the forming cosmic filaments, in contradiction with the fixed direction expected from the TTT. In this work we present a novel analytical approach that introduces an anisotropic scaling factor to the standard TTT equations, which allows the AM orientation to change in time, even during the linear regime. The amplitude and direction of this shift depend on the large scale tidal field around the forming proto-haloes. Our results significantly improve the predictions for the AM direction up to the time of protohalo collapse and, in some cases, even further in time.</description>

      <title>{\sc SimBIG}: Cosmological Constraints using Simulation-Based Inference of Galaxy Clustering with Marked Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first $\Lambda$CDM cosmological analysis performed on a galaxy survey using marked power spectra. The marked power spectrum is the two-point function of a marked field, where galaxies are weighted by a function that depends on their local density. The presence of the mark leads these statistics to contain higher-order information of the original galaxy field, making them a good candidate to exploit the non-Gaussian information of a galaxy catalog. In this work we make use of \simbig, a forward modeling framework for galaxy clustering analyses, and perform simulation-based inference using normalizing flows to infer the posterior distribution of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters. We consider different mark configurations (ways to weight the galaxy field) and deploy them in the \simbig~pipeline to analyze the corresponding marked power spectra measured from a subset of the BOSS galaxy sample. We analyze the redshift-space mark power spectra decomposed in $\ell = 0, 2, 4$ multipoles and include scales up to the non-linear regime. Among the various mark configurations considered, the ones that give the most stringent cosmological constraints produce posterior median and $68\%$ confidence limits on the growth of structure parameters equal to $\Omega_m=0.273^{+0.040}_{-0.030}$ and $\sigma_8=0.777^{+0.077}_{-0.071}$. Compared to a perturbation theory analysis using the power spectrum of the same dataset, the \simbig~marked power spectra constraints on $\sigma_8$ are up to $1.2\times$ tighter, while no improvement is seen for the other cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Bounds on galaxy stochasticity from halo occupation distribution modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint probability distribution of matter overdensity and galaxy counts in cells is a powerful probe of cosmology, and the extent to which variance in galaxy counts at fixed matter density deviates from Poisson shot noise is not fully understood. The lack of informed bounds on this stochasticity is currently the limiting factor in constraining cosmology with the galaxy-matter PDF. We investigate stochasticity in the conditional distribution of galaxy counts at fixed matter density and present a halo occupation distribution (HOD)-based approach for obtaining plausible ranges for stochasticity parameters. To probe the high-dimensional space of possible galaxy-matter connections, we derive HODs which conserve linear galaxy bias and number density to produce redMaGiC-like galaxy catalogs within the AbacusSummit suite of N-body simulations. We study the impact of individual HOD parameters and cosmology on stochasticity and perform a Monte Carlo search in HOD parameter space, subject to the constraints on bias and density. In mock catalogs generated by the selected HODs, shot noise in galaxy counts spans both sub-Poisson and super-Poisson values, ranging from 80% to 133% of Poisson variance at mean matter density. Nearly all derived HODs show a positive relationship between local matter density and stochasticity. For galaxy catalogs with higher stochasticity, quadratic galaxy bias is required for an accurate description of the conditional PDF of galaxy counts at fixed matter density. The presence of galaxy assembly bias also substantially extends the range of stochasticity in the super-Poisson direction. This HOD-based approach leverages degrees of freedom in the galaxy-halo connection to obtain informed bounds on model nuisance parameters and can be adapted to other parametrizations of stochasticity, in particular to motivate prior ranges for cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger Probes of Asteroid Mass Primordial Black Holes: Superradiance Spectroscopy, Hawking Radiation, and Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiance provides a unique opportunity for investigating dark sectors as well as primordial black holes (PBHs), which themselves are candidates for dark matter (DM) over a wide mass range. Using axion-like particles (ALPs) as an example, we show that line signals emerging from a superradiated ALP cloud combined with Hawking radiation from PBHs in extragalactic and galactic halos, along with microlensing observations lead to complementary constraints on parameter space combinations including the ALP-photon coupling, ALP mass, PBH mass, and PBH DM fraction, $f_{\rm PBH}$. For the PBH asteroid mass range $\sim10^{16}-10^{22}~{\rm g}$, where PBHs can provide the totality of DM, we demonstrate that ongoing and upcoming observations such as SXI, JWST, and AMEGO-X will be sensitive to possible line and continuum signals, respectively, providing probes of previously inaccessible regions of $f_{\rm PBH}$ parameter space. Further complementarity from a stochastic gravitational-wave background emerging from the PBH formation mechanism is also considered.</description>

      <title>Falsifying Anthropics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since axion misalignment must be induced by Brownian drift in (quasi)de Sitter space, this could invalidate anthropic prediction of dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>Multi-purpose InSTRument for Astronomy at Low-resolution: MISTRAL@OHP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MISTRAL is the new Faint Object Spectroscopic Camera mounted at the folded Cassegrain focus of the 1.93m telescope of Haute-Provence Observatory. We describe the design and components of the instrument and give some details about its operation. We emphasise in particular the various observing modes and the performances of the detector. A short description is also given about the working environment. Various types of objects, including stars, nebulae, comets, novae, galaxies have been observed during various test phases to evaluate the performances of the instrument. The instrument covers the range of 4000 to 8000A with the blue setting, or from 6000 to 10000A with the red setting, at an average spectral resolution of 700. Its peak efficiency is about 22% at 6000A. In spectroscopy, a limiting magnitude of 19.5 can be achieved for a point source in one hour with a signal to noise of 3 in the continuum (and better if emission lines are present). In imaging mode, limiting magnitudes of 20-21 can be obtained in 10-20mn (with average seing conditions of 2.5 arcsec at OHP). The instrument is very users-friendly and can be put into operations in less than 15mn (rapid change-over from the other instrument in use) if required by the science (like for Gamma-Rays Bursts). Some first scientific results are described for various types of objects, and in particular for the follow-up of GRBs. While some further improvements are still under way, in particular to ease the switch from blue to red setting and add more grisms or filters, MISTRAL is ready for the follow-up of transients and other variable objects, in the soon-to-come era of e.g. the SVOM satellite and of the Rubin telescope.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves in non-singular matter bouncing cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel model-independent generic mechanism for primordial black hole formation within the context of non-singular matter bouncing cosmology. In particular, considering a short duration transition from the matter contracting phase to the Hot Big Bang expanding Universe, we find naturally enhanced curvature perturbations on very small scales which can collapse and form primordial black holes. Interestingly, the primordial black hole masses that we find can lie within the observationally unconstrained asteroid-mass window, potentially explaining the totality of dark matter. Remarkably, the enhanced curvature perturbations, collapsing to primordial black holes, can induce as well a stochastic gravitational-wave background, being potentially detectable by future experiments, in particular by SKA, PTAs, LISA and ET, hence serving as a new portal to probe the potential bouncing nature of the initial conditions prevailing in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>FarView: An In-Situ Manufactured Lunar Far Side Radio Array Concept for 21-cm Dark Ages Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FarView is an early-stage concept for a large, low-frequency radio observatory, manufactured in-situ on the lunar far side using metals extracted from the lunar regolith. It consists of 100,000 dipole antennas in compact subarrays distributed over a large area but with empty space between subarrays in a core-halo structure. FarView covers a total area of ~200 km2, has a dense core within the inner ~36 km2, and a ~power-law falloff of antenna density out to ~14 km from the center. With this design, it is relatively easy to identify multiple viable build sites on the lunar far side. The science case for FarView emphasizes the unique capabilities to probe the unexplored Cosmic Dark Ages - identified by the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey as the discovery area for cosmology. FarView will deliver power spectra and tomographic maps tracing the evolution of the Universe from before the birth of the first stars to the beginning of Cosmic Dawn, and potentially provide unique insights into dark matter, early dark energy, neutrino masses, and the physics of inflation. What makes FarView feasible and affordable in the timeframe of the 2030s is that it is manufactured in-situ, utilizing space industrial technologies. This in-situ manufacturing architecture utilizes Earth-built equipment that is transported to the lunar surface to extract metals from the regolith and will use those metals to manufacture most of the array components: dipole antennas, power lines, and silicon solar cell power systems. This approach also enables a long functional lifetime, by permitting servicing and repair of the observatory. The full 100,000 dipole FarView observatory will take 4 - 8 years to build, depending on the realized performance of the manufacturing elements and the lunar delivery scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via the direct collapse of baryonic clouds, where the necessary formation of molecular hydrogen is supressed by a Lyman-Werner (LW) photon background from relic particle decay. We improve on existing studies by dynamically simulating the collapse, accounting for the adiabatic contraction of the DM halo, as well as the in-situ production of the LW photons within the cloud which reduce the impact of the cloud's shielding. We find a viable parameter space where the decay of either some or all of the dark matter could successfully lead to the direct collapse of a SMBH.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Matter with Forbidden Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dark matter model based on QCD-like $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with electroweakly interacting dark quarks is discussed. Assuming the dark quark mass $m$ is smaller than the dynamical scale $\Lambda_d \sim 4\pi f_d$, the main component of the dark matter is the lightest $G$-parity odd dark pion associated with chiral symmetry breaking in the dark sector. We show that nonzero dark quark mass induces the universal mass contribution to both $G$-parity odd and even pions, and their masses tend to be degenerate. As a result, dark pion annihilation into heavier $G$-parity even dark pion also affects the dark matter relic abundance. Thus, our setup naturally accommodates forbidden dark matter scenario and realizes heavy dark matter whose mass is ${\cal O}(1$-$100)~{\rm TeV}$, which is different from conventional electroweakly interacting dark matter such as minimal dark matter. We also discuss CP-violation from $\theta$-term in the dark gauge sector and find that the predicted size of electron electric dipole moment can be as large as $\sim 10^{-32}~e~{\rm cm}$.</description>

      <title>Prospects for constraining interacting dark energy cosmology with gravitational-wave bright sirens detected by future SKA-era pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have the potential to detect Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) that are usually generated by the individual inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the galactic centers. The GW signals as cosmological standard sirens can provide the absolute cosmic distances, thereby can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we analyze the ability of future SKA-era PTAs to detect the existing SMBHBs candidates assuming the root mean square of timing noise $\sigma_t=20\ {\rm ns}$, and use the simulated PTA data to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models with energy transfer rate $Q = \beta H\rho_c$. We find that, the future SKA-era PTAs will play an important role in constraining the IDE cosmology. Using only the mock PTA data consisting of 100 pulsars, we obtain $\sigma(H_0)=0.239\ {\rm km} \ {\rm s}^{-1} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\sigma(\Omega_m)=0.0103$ in the I$\Lambda$CDM model, which are much better than the results from the Planck TT, TE, EE+lowE. However, the PTA data cannot provide a tight constraint on the coupling parameter $\beta$ compared with Planck, but the data combination of Planck+PTA can provide a rather tight constraint, i.e., $\sigma(\beta)=0.00232$, since the PTA data could break the parameter degeneracies inherent in CMB. In the I$w$CDM model, we obtain $\sigma(\beta)=0.00137$ and $\sigma(w)=0.0492$ from the Planck+PTA data combination. In addition, we find that with the increase of the number of pulsars in PTA, the constraint results from the Planck+PTA will be further improved to some extent. We show that the observations of Nanohertz GWs with future SKA-era PTAs will provide a powerful tool for exploring the nature of dark energy and measuring the coupling between dark energy and dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $ $Future surveys could obtain tighter constraints on the cosmological parameters with the galaxy power spectrum than with the Cosmic Microwave Background. However, the inclusion of multiple overlapping tracers, redshift bins, and more non-linear scales means that generating the necessary ensemble of simulations for model-fitting presents a computational burden. In this work, we combine full-shape fitting of galaxy power spectra, analytical covariance matrix estimates, the MOPED (Massively Optimised Parameter Estimation and Data compression) method, and the Taylor expansion interpolation of the power spectrum for the first time to constrain the cosmological parameters directly from a state-of-the-art set of galaxy clustering measurements. We find it takes less than a day to compute the analytical covariance while it takes several months to calculate the simulated ones. Combining MOPED with the Taylor expansion interpolation of the power spectrum, we can constrain the cosmological parameters in just a few hours instead of a few days. We also find that even without a priori knowledge of the best-fit cosmological or galaxy bias parameters, the analytical covariance matrix with the MOPED compression still gives consistent cosmological constraints to within 0.1$\sigma$ after two iterations. Therefore, the pipeline we have developed here can significantly speed up the analysis for future surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Machine learning unveils the linear matter power spectrum of modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matter power spectrum $P(k)$ is one of the main quantities connecting observational and theoretical cosmology. Although for a fixed redshift this can be numerically computed very efficiently by Boltzmann solvers, an analytical description is always desirable. However, accurate fitting functions for $P(k)$ are only available for the concordance model. Taking into account that forthcoming surveys will further constrain the parameter space of cosmological models, it is also of interest to have analytical formulations for $P(k)$ when alternative models are considered. Here, we use the genetic algorithms, a machine learning technique, to find a parametric function for $P(k)$ considering several possible effects imprinted by modifications of gravity. Our expression for the $P(k)$ of modified gravity shows a mean accuracy of around 1-2% when compared with numerical data obtained via modified versions of the Boltzmann solver CLASS, and thus it represents a competitive formulation given the target accuracy of forthcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Based Statistics for Enhanced 21cm EoR Parameter Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to improve the precision of astrophysical parameter constraints for the 21cm signal from the epoch of reionisation (EoR). Our method introduces new sets of summary statistics, hereafter `evolution compressed' statistics, which quantify the spectral evolution of the 2D spatial statistics computed at fixed redshift. We defined such compressed statistics for power spectrum (PS), wavelet scattering transforms (WST), and wavelet moments (WM), which also characterise non-Gaussian features. To compare these different statistics, along with the 3D power spectrum, we estimated their Fisher information on three cosmological parameters from an ensemble of simulations of 21cm EoR data, both in noiseless and noisy scenarios using Square Kilometre Array (SKA) noise levels equivalent to 100 and 1000 hours of observations. We also compare wavelet statistics, in particular WST, built from standard directional Morlet wavelets, as well as from a set of isotropic wavelets derived from the binning window function of the 2D power spectrum. For the noiseless case, the compressed wavelet statistics give constraints that are up to five times more precise than those obtained from the 3D isotropic power spectrum. At the same time, for 100h SKA noise, from which it is difficult to extract non-Gaussian features, compressed wavelet statistics still give over 30\% tighter constraints. We find that the wavelet statistics with wavelets derived from the power-spectrum binning window function provide the tightest constraints of all the statistics, with the WSTs seemingly performing better than the WMs, in particular when working with noisy data. The findings of this study demonstrate that evolution-compressed statistics extract more information than usual 3D isotropic power-spectra approaches and that our wavelet-based statistics can consistently outmatch power-spectrum-based statistics.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Identifying the reddest high-redshift galaxies in the Euclid Deep Fields with gradient-boosted trees</title>

Abstract: Dusty, distant, massive ($M_*\gtrsim 10^{11}\,\rm M_\odot$) galaxies are usually found to show a remarkable star-formation activity, contributing on the order of $25\%$ of the cosmic star-formation rate density at $z\approx3$--$5$, and up to $30\%$ at $z\sim7$ from ALMA observations. Nonetheless, they are elusive in classical optical surveys, and current near-infrared surveys are able to detect them only in very small sky areas. Since these objects have low space densities, deep and wide surveys are necessary to obtain statistically relevant results about them. Euclid will be potentially capable of delivering the required information, but, given the lack of spectroscopic features at these distances within its bands, it is still unclear if it will be possible to identify and characterize these objects. The goal of this work is to assess the capability of Euclid, together with ancillary optical and near-infrared data, to identify these distant, dusty and massive galaxies, based on broadband photometry. We used a gradient-boosting algorithm to predict both the redshift and spectral type of objects at high $z$. To perform such an analysis we make use of simulated photometric observations derived using the SPRITZ software. The gradient-boosting algorithm was found to be accurate in predicting both the redshift and spectral type of objects within the Euclid Deep Survey simulated catalog at $z&gt;2$. In particular, we study the analog of HIEROs (i.e. sources with $H-[4.5]&gt;2.25$), combining Euclid and Spitzer data at the depth of the Deep Fields. We found that the dusty population at $3\lesssim z\lesssim 7$ is well identified, with a redshift RMS and OLF of only $0.55$ and $8.5\%$ ($H_E\leq26$), respectively. Our findings suggest that with Euclid we will obtain meaningful insights into the role of massive and dusty galaxies in the cosmic star-formation rate over time.</description>

      <title>No need to know: astrophysics-free gravitational-wave cosmology</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging compact objects encode direct information about the luminosity distance to the binary. When paired with a redshift measurement, this enables standard-siren cosmology: a Hubble diagram can be constructed to directly probe the Universe's expansion. This can be done in the absence of electromagnetic measurements as features in the mass distribution of GW sources provide self-calibrating redshift measurements without the need for a definite or probabilistic host galaxy association. This technique has thus far only been applied with simple parametric representations of the mass distribution. However, the use of an inaccurate representation leads to biases in the cosmological inference, an acute problem given the current uncertainties in true source population. Furthermore, it is commonly presumed that the form of the mass distribution must be known a priori to obtain unbiased measurements of cosmological parameters in this fashion. Here, we demonstrate that spectral sirens can accurately infer cosmological parameters without such prior assumptions. We apply a flexible, non-parametric model for the mass distribution of compact binaries to a simulated catalog of 1,000 gravitational-wave events, consistent with expectations for the next LVK observing run. We find that, despite our model's flexibility, both the source mass model and cosmological parameters are correctly reconstructed. We predict a $5.8\%$ measurement of $H_0$, keeping all other cosmological parameters fixed, and a $6.4\%$ measurement of $H(z=0.9)$ when fitting for multiple cosmological parameters ($1\sigma$ uncertainties). This astrophysically-agnostic spectral siren technique will be essential to arrive at precise and unbiased cosmological constraints from GW source populations.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 IV: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the Lyman Alpha Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest of high-redshift quasars with the first-year dataset of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis uses over $420\,000$ Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra and their correlation with the spatial distribution of more than $700\,000$ quasars. An essential facet of this work is the development of a new analysis methodology on a blinded dataset. We conducted rigorous tests using synthetic data to ensure the reliability of our methodology and findings before unblinding. Additionally, we conducted multiple data splits to assess the consistency of the results and scrutinized various analysis approaches to confirm their robustness. For a given value of the sound horizon ($r_d$), we measure the expansion at $z_{\rm eff}=2.33$ with 2\% precision, $H(z_{\rm eff}) = (239.2 \pm 4.8) (147.09~{\rm Mpc} /r_d)$ km/s/Mpc. Similarly, we present a 2.4\% measurement of the transverse comoving distance to the same redshift, $D_M(z_{\rm eff}) = (5.84 \pm 0.14) (r_d/147.09~{\rm Mpc})$ Gpc. Together with other DESI BAO measurements at lower redshifts, these results are used in a companion paper to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal Reconstruction of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations for DESI 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide a robust standard ruler to measure the expansion history of the Universe through galaxy clustering. Density-field reconstruction is now a widely adopted procedure for increasing the precision and accuracy of the BAO detection. With the goal of finding the optimal reconstruction settings to be used in the DESI 2024 galaxy BAO analysis, we assess the sensitivity of the post-reconstruction BAO constraints to different choices in our analysis configuration, performing tests on blinded data from the first year of DESI observations (DR1), as well as on mocks that mimic the expected clustering and selection properties of the DESI DR1 target samples. Overall, we find that BAO constraints remain robust against multiple aspects in the reconstruction process, including the choice of smoothing scale, treatment of redshift-space distortions, fiber assignment incompleteness, and parameterizations of the BAO model. We also present a series of tests that DESI followed in order to assess the maturity of the end-to-end galaxy BAO pipeline before the unblinding of the large-scale structure catalogs.</description>

      <title>Production of Alternate Realizations of DESI Fiber Assignment for Unbiased Clustering Measurement in Data and Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical requirement of spectroscopic large scale structure analyses is correcting for selection of which galaxies to observe from an isotropic target list. This selection is often limited by the hardware used to perform the survey which will impose angular constraints of simultaneously observable targets, requiring multiple passes to observe all of them. In SDSS this manifested solely as the collision of physical fibers and plugs placed in plates. In DESI, there is the additional constraint of the robotic positioner which controls each fiber being limited to a finite patrol radius. A number of approximate methods have previously been proposed to correct the galaxy clustering statistics for these effects, but these generally fail on small scales. To accurately correct the clustering we need to upweight pairs of galaxies based on the inverse probability that those pairs would be observed (Bianchi \&amp; Percival 2017). This paper details an implementation of that method to correct the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey for incompleteness. To calculate the required probabilities, we need a set of alternate realizations of DESI where we vary the relative priority of otherwise identical targets. These realizations take the form of alternate Merged Target Ledgers (AMTL), the files that link DESI observations and targets. We present the method used to generate these alternate realizations and how they are tracked forward in time using the real observational record and hardware status, propagating the survey as though the alternate orderings had been adopted. We detail the first applications of this method to the DESI One-Percent Survey (SV3) and the DESI year 1 data. We include evaluations of the pipeline outputs, estimation of survey completeness from this and other methods, and validation of the method using mock galaxy catalogs.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical covariance matrices for two-point correlation function for DESI 2024 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimized way of producing the fast semi-analytical covariance matrices for the Legendre moments of the two-point correlation function, taking into account survey geometry and mimicking the non-Gaussian effects. We validate the approach on simulated (mock) catalogs for different galaxy types, representative of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1, used in 2024 analyses. We find only a few percent differences between the mock sample covariance matrix and our results, which can be expected given the approximate nature of the mocks, although we do identify discrepancies between the shot-noise properties of the DESI fiber assignment algorithm and the faster approximation used in the mocks. Importantly, we find a close agreement (&lt;~ 5% relative differences) in the projected errorbars for distance scale parameters for the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. This confirms our method as an attractive alternative to simulation-based covariance matrices, especially for non-standard models or galaxy sample selections, in particular, relevant to the broad current and future analyses of DESI data.</description>

      <title>HOD-Dependent Systematics for Luminous Red Galaxies in the DESI 2024 BAO Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the estimation of systematics related to the halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling in the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) distance measurement of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 analysis. This paper focuses on the study of HOD systematics for luminous red galaxies (LRG). We consider three different HOD models for LRGs, including the base 5-parameter vanilla model and two extensions to it, that we refer to as baseline and extended models. The baseline model is described by the 5 vanilla HOD parameters, an incompleteness factor and a velocity bias parameter, whereas the extended one also includes a galaxy assembly bias and a satellite profile parameter. We utilize the 25 dark matter simulations available in the AbacusSummit simulation suite at $z=$ 0.8 and generate mock catalogs for our different HOD models. To test the impact of the HOD modeling in the position of the BAO peak, we run BAO fits for all these sets of simulations and compare the best-fit BAO-scaling parameters $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ and $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ between every pair of HOD models. We do this for both Fourier and configuration spaces independently, using post-reconstruction measurements. We find a 3.3$\sigma$ detection of HOD systematic for $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ in configuration space with an amplitude of 0.19%. For the other cases, we did not find a 3$\sigma$ detection, and we decided to compute a conservative estimation of the systematic using the ensemble of shifts between all pairs of HOD models. By doing this, we quote a systematic with an amplitude of 0.07% in $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ for both Fourier and configuration spaces; and of 0.09% in $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ for Fourier space.</description>

Abstract: Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) are promising probes for clustering measurements at high redshift, $z&gt;2$, a region only covered so far by Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of selecting LBGs by exploiting the existence of a strong deficit of flux shortward of the Lyman limit, due to various absorption processes along the line of sight. The target selection relies on deep imaging data from the HSC and CLAUDS surveys in the $g,r,z$ and $u$ bands, respectively, with median depths reaching 27 AB in all bands. The selections were validated by several dedicated spectroscopic observation campaigns with DESI. Visual inspection of spectra has enabled us to develop an automated spectroscopic typing and redshift estimation algorithm specific to LBGs. Based on these data and tools, we assess the efficiency and purity of target selections optimised for different purposes. Selections providing a wide redshift coverage retain $57\%$ of the observed targets after spectroscopic confirmation with DESI, and provide an efficiency for LBGs of $83\pm3\%$, for a purity of the selected LBG sample of $90\pm2\%$. This would deliver a confirmed LBG density of $\sim 620$ deg$^{-2}$ in the range $2.3&lt;z&lt;3.5$ for a $r$-band limiting magnitude $r&lt;24.2$. Selections optimised for high redshift efficiency retain $73\%$ of the observed targets after spectroscopic confirmation, with $89\pm4\%$ efficiency for $97\pm2\%$ purity. This would provide a confirmed LBG density of $\sim 470$ deg$^{-2}$ in the range $2.8&lt;z&lt;3.5$ for a $r$-band limiting magnitude $r&lt;24.5$. A preliminary study of the LBG sample 3d-clustering properties is also presented and used to estimate the LBG linear bias. A value of $b_{LBG} = 3.3 \pm 0.2 (stat.)$ is obtained for a mean redshift of 2.9 and a limiting magnitude in $r$ of 24.2, in agreement with results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis and Dark Matter in Multiple Hidden Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a mechanism for producing the baryon asymmetry and dark matter in models with multiple hidden sectors that are Standard-Model-like but with varying Higgs mass parameters. If the field responsible for reheating the Standard Model and the exotic sectors carries an asymmetry, it can be converted into a baryon asymmetry using the standard sphaleron process. A hidden sector with positive Higgs mass squared can accommodate dark matter with its baryon asymmetry, and the larger abundance of dark matter relative to baryons is due to dark sphalerons being active all the way down the hidden sector QCD scale. This scenario predicts that dark matter is clustered in large dark nuclei and gives a lower bound on the effective relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 0.05$, which may be observable in the next-generation cosmic microwave background experiment CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Mass density vs. energy density at cosmological scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of the gravitational field, the energy density of matter no longer coincides with its mass density. A discrepancy exists, of course, also between the associated power spectra. Within the $\Lambda$CDM model, we derive a formula that relates the power spectrum of the energy density to that of the mass density and test it with the help of N-body simulations run in comoving boxes of 2.816 Gpc/$h$. The results confirm the validity of the derived formula and simultaneously show that the power spectra diverge significantly from one another at large cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Attractive (s)axions: cosmological trackers at the boundary of moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological evolution of a FLRW universe dominated by the energy density of moduli close to asymptotic regions of moduli space. Due to the structure of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA kinetic term, a saxion and an axion residing in the same chiral multiplet are (universally) coupled even if the latter is a flat direction of the potential, resulting in non-trivial dynamics. We generalise known results in the literature to the case of multiple moduli, showing the existence of various ``tracker" attractor solutions where the relative energy densities of many components (axions included) stay in a fixed ratio throughout the evolution. We conclude with some phenomenological applications, relevant for both the early and late universe.</description>

      <title>Comments Concerning a Hypothetical Mesoscopic Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by string-theoretic swampland conjectures, the existence of a dark fifth dimension, whose size is roughly 1 -- 10 microns, has been proposed. A great deal of supporting evidence has been presented, and definitive experimental tests are likely to be carried out. The basic idea is that the four-dimensional spacetime that we observe lives on a brane that is localized in the dark dimension. This short note points out that there are two distinct ways to realize such a scenario in string theory/M-theory. In the one considered previously the dark dimension is topologically a circle and our observable 4d spacetime is confined to a brane that is localized in a GUT-scale region of the circle. An alternative possibility is that the dark dimension is a line interval with branes attached at each end. This option would imply the existence of a parallel 4d spacetime microns away from us!</description>
