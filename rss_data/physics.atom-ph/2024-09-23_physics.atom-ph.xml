      <title>Chaotic dynamics in spin torque nano oscillator driven by voltage feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-linear dynamics, including auto-oscillations, chaotic dynamics, and synchronization, are integral to physical and biological applications and can be excited in spintronic devices. In this study, we are interested in exploring the excitation of chaos using voltage feedback in a spin torque nano oscillator using a Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ). According to the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem, chaos cannot arise in a two-dimensional system of MTJ featuring two dynamic variables describing the zenith and azimuth angles of magnetization. Hence, we prefer the feedback system as it creates a multi-dimensional system, making it interesting to explore the emergence of chaos in such systems. Such feedback is achieved by utilizing a 3-terminal device consisting of an MTJ with an in-plane pinned layer (PL) and an out-of-plane free layer (FL) geometry. When a DC current above the critical threshold is applied, the FL's oscillating magnetization generates an AC output voltage through the Tunnel Magneto Resistance (TMR) effect. A fraction of this voltage, fed back after a delay, modulates the FL's anisotropy via voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect, potentially driving precessional motion or chaotic dynamics or oscillator death based on the feedback delay and gain of the feedback circuit. The observed chaotic regime has been studied by evaluating the Lyapunov exponent, bifurcation diagrams, Fourier spectral analysis and reconstruction of the trajectory in embedding phase space. Such observed chaotic dynamics can find practical applications in random number generators and physical reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Multiple ionization, fragmentation and dehydrogenation of coronene in collision with swift proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronene molecules have been bombarded by protons of energy by 75 to 300 keV. The time of flight mass spectrum has been recorded using a two stage Wiley McLaren type spectrometer. A large enhancement in the doubly and triply ionized recoil ion is observed compared to the singly ionized one. The single, double and triple ionization yields have also been calculated using the continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state (CDW EIS) theoretical model and are compared with the experimental results. Experimental double to single ionization yield ratios and triple to single ionization yield ratios have been compared with the theoretical ratios which are found to be much higher w.r. t. the gas atoms. Evaporation peaks due to the loss of several neutral C2H2 and C3H3 are observed corresponding to their parent singly, doubly and triply charge coronene ions. Small fragmentation peaks CnHx+ (n = 3 to 7) are present in the spectra due to higher energy transfer by the projectile to the molecule. The hydrogen losses are observed in the cation, di-cation and tri-cation coronene peak structures. A maximum of the 7 H losses are detected which depends on the beam energy.</description>

      <title>Cold Beam Optical Clock with Multifrequency Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an optical clock based on Ramsey-Bord\'e interferometry in a laser-cooled ${}^{40}$Ca beam. The mean velocity is reduced by an order of magnitude relative to a thermal beam and the transverse temperature approaches the Doppler limit, enabling the measurement of sub-kHz linewidth fringes in a compact interferometer. Using tailored phase and intensity modulation of the spectroscopy laser to add uniform frequency sidebands, we interrogate atoms throughout the transverse velocity distribution, increasing the Ramsey-Bord\'e fringe amplitude by a factor of 14 and improving the Allan deviation to $3.4\times 10^{-15}$ at one second averaging time.</description>

      <title>Coherent dynamics of a nuclear-spin-isomer superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preserving quantum coherence with the increase of a system's size and complexity is a major challenge. Molecules, with their diverse sizes and complexities and many degrees of freedom, are an excellent platform for studying the transition from quantum to classical behavior. While most quantum-control studies of molecules focus on vibrations and rotations, we focus here on creating a quantum superposition between two nuclear-spin isomers of the same molecule. We present a scheme that exploits an avoided crossing in the spectrum to create strong coupling between two uncoupled nuclear-spin-isomer states, hence creating an isomeric qubit. We model our scheme using a four-level Hamiltonian and explore the coherent dynamics in the different regimes and parameters of our system. Our four-level model and approach can be applied to other systems with a similar energy-level structure.</description>

      <title>Vibrationally coupled Rydberg atom-ion molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the occurrence of Rydberg atom-ion molecules (RAIMs) in a hybrid atom-ion system with an ion crystal trapped in a Paul trap coupled to Rydberg atoms on its either ends. To assess the feasibility of such a system, we perform a detailed Floquet analysis of the effect of the Paul trap's rf potential on the RAIMs and provide a qualitative analysis of the survival probability based on scaling laws. We conclude that the RAIM survives for sufficiently weak and low frequency traps. We then use this hybrid system and propose a scheme to utilise the common motional modes of the ion crystal to suppress (blockade) or enhance (anti-blockade) the probability of forming two RAIMs at the ends of the chain, replacing the typical blockade radius by the length of the ion crystal.</description>

      <title>Path integral for the quartic oscillator: An accurate analytic formula for the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work an approximate analytic expression for the quantum partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$ is presented. Using a path integral formalism, the exact partition function is approximated by the partition function of a harmonic oscillator with an effective frequency depending both on the temperature and coupling constant $g$. By invoking a Principle of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) of the path integral to the effective frequency, we derive a mathematically well-defined analytic formula for the partition function. Quite remarkably, the formula reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the key features of the exact partition function. The free energy is accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical (high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. The divergence of the power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate coefficients. Explicit accurate expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies, $E_0(g)$ and $E_1(g)$ are also presented.</description>
