      <title>2-Categorical Foundations for Multiparameter Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to multi-parameter persistence using 2-categorical structures. We develop a framework that captures hierarchical interactions between filter parameters, overcoming fundamental limitations of traditional persistence modules. Our 2-categorical model yields new invariants that effectively characterize multidimensional topological features while maintaining computational tractability. We prove stability theorems for these invariants and demonstrate their effectiveness through applications in genomics and complex network analysis.</description>

      <title>Intersection homotopy, refinements and coarsenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works, we studied intersection homotopy groups associated to a Goresky and MacPherson perversity and a filtered space. They are defined as the homotopy groups of simplicial sets introduced by P. Gajer. We particularized to locally conical spaces of Siebenmann (called CS sets) and established a topological invariance for them when the regular part remains unchanged.
  Here, we consider coarsenings, made of two structures of CS sets on the same topological space, the strata of one being a union of strata of the other. We endow them with a general perversity and its pushforward, where the adjective ``general'' means that the perversities are defined on the poset of the strata and not only according to their codimension. If the perversity verifies a growing property analogous to that of the original perversities of Goresky and MacPherson, we also find an invariance theorem for the intersection homotopy groups of a coarsening, under the above restriction on the regular parts. An invariance is shown too in some cases where singular strata become regular in the coarsening, for Thom-Mather spaces.</description>

      <title>A genuine $G$-spectrum for the cut-and-paste $K$-theory of $G$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has applied scissors congruence $K$-theory to study classical cut-and-paste ($SK$) invariants of manifolds. This paper proves the conjecture that the squares $K$-theory of equivariant $SK$-manifolds arises as the fixed points of a genuine $G$-spectrum. Our method utilizes the framework of spectral Mackey functors as models for genuine $G$-spectra, and our main technical result is a general procedure for constructing spectral Mackey functors using squares $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>The p-local stable Adams conjecture: Erratum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.11014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This erratum remedies errors in the literature pertaining to the stable Adams conjecture. As part of the above corrections, we also identify and fix two errors in section 4 of our recent article on the subject. We thank E. Fridelander for flagging these oversights and for offering helpful suggestions. This erratum is self-contained and also includes an appendix proving a version of Friedlander's classification result for sectioned fibrations of Gamma-spaces, after making appropriate changes to the original statement as indicated in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Topological feature selection for time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use tools from applied topology for feature selection on time series data. We develop a method for scoring the variables in a multivariate time series that reflects their contributions to the topological features of the corresponding point cloud. Our approach produces a piecewise-linear Lipschitz gradient path in the standard geometric simplex that starts at the barycenter, which weights the variables equally, and ends at the score. Adding Gaussian perturbations to the input data and taking expectations results in a mean gradient path that satisfies a strong law of large numbers and central limit theorem. Our theory is motivated by the analysis of the neuronal activities of the nematode C. elegans, and our method selects an informative subset of the neurons that optimizes the coordinated dynamics.</description>

      <title>(Non-)vanishing results for extensions between simple outer functors on free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16881v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study cohomological properties of the category of polynomial outer functors on free groups, which are the functors from the category of finitely generated free groups to the category of rational vector spaces which send all inner automorphisms to the identity morphism, and which satisfy a certain polynomiality property. More precisely, we prove vanishing and non-vanishing results for the Ext groups between simple polynomial outer functors. This work is inspired by an earlier result of Vespa for the category of all polynomial functors from finitely generated free groups to rational vector spaces; it follows in particular from her results that, in this larger category, the Ext groups between simple functors are always concentrated in a specific single degree. Our main results show that, when we pass to the full subcategory of polynomial outer functors, Ext groups between simple functors are sometimes non-trivial outside of this specific degree.</description>

      <title>Path spaces of pushouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a span of spaces, one can form the homotopy pushout and then take the homotopy pullback of the resulting cospan. We give a concrete description of this pullback as the colimit of a sequence of approximations, using what we call the zigzag construction. We also obtain a description of loop spaces of homotopy pushouts. Using the zigzag construction, we reproduce generalisations of the Blakers-Massey theorem and fundamental results from Bass-Serre theory. We also describe the loop space of a wedge and show that it splits after suspension. Our construction can be interpreted in a large class of $(\infty,1)$-categories and in homotopy type theory, where it resolves the long-standing open problem of showing that a pushout of 0-types is 1-truncated. The zigzag construction is closely related to the James construction, but works in greater generality.</description>

      <title>Spectral Floer theory and tangential structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \cite{PS}, for a stably framed Liouville manifold $X$ we defined a Donaldson-Fukaya category $\mathcal{F}(X;\mathbb{S})$ over the sphere spectrum, and developed an obstruction theory for lifting quasi-isomorphisms from $\mathcal{F}(X;\mathbb{Z})$ to $\mathcal{F}(X;\mathbb{S})$. Here, we define a spectral Donaldson-Fukaya category for any `graded tangential pair' $\Theta \to \Phi$ of spaces living over $BO \to BU$, whose objects are Lagrangians $L\to X$ for which the classifying maps of their tangent bundles lift to $\Theta \to \Phi$. The previous case corresponded to $\Theta = \Phi = \{\mathrm{pt}\}$. We extend our obstruction theory to this setting. The flexibility to `tune' the choice of $\Theta$ and $\Phi$ increases the range of cases in which one can kill the obstructions, with applications to bordism classes of Lagrangian embeddings in the corresponding bordism theory $\Omega^{(\Theta,\Phi),\circ}_*$. We include a self-contained discussion of when (exact) spectral Floer theory over a ring spectrum $R$ should exist, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Modular functors from conformal blocks of rational vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a vertex operator algebra $V$, one may naturally define spaces of conformal blocks following a construction of Frenkel-Ben-Zvi generalized by Damiolini-Gibney-Tarasca. If $V$ is strongly rational, these spaces of conformal blocks form vector bundles over a suitable moduli space of algebraic curves. In this article, we establish, under the same assumptions, the widely expected topological result that the spaces of conformal blocks produce a modular functor, i.e. a modular algebra over an extension of the surface operad. This entails that the category $\mathcal{C}_V$ of admissible $V$-modules inherits from the topology of genus zero surfaces a ribbon Grothendieck-Verdier structure that leads even to the structure of a modular fusion category whose structure comes directly from the spaces of conformal blocks of $V$. As a direct consequence, we prove that the modular functor from conformal blocks extends to a three-dimensional topological field theory and comes with a description in terms of factorization homology.</description>
