      <title>Untangling the interplay of the Equation-of-State and the Collision Term towards the generation of Directed and Elliptic Flow at intermediate energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism for generating directed and elliptic flow in heavy-ion collisions is investigated and quantified for the SIS18 and SIS100 energy regimes. The observed negative elliptic flow $v_2$, at midrapidity has been explained either via (in-plane) shadowing or via (out-of-plane) squeeze-out. To settle this question, we employ the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics model (UrQMD) to calculate Au+Au collisions at E$_\mathrm{lab}=0.6A$ GeV, E$_\mathrm{lab}=1.23A$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=3.0$ GeV using a hard Skyrme type Equation-of-State to calculate the time evolution and generation of directed flow and elliptic flow. We quantitatively distinguish the impact of collisions and of the potential on $v_1$ and $v_2$ during the evolution of the system. These calculations reveal that in this energy regime the generation of $v_1$ and $v_2$ follows from a highly intricate interplay of different processes and is created late, after the system has reached its highest density and has created a matter bridge between projectile and target remnant, which later breaks. Initially, we find a strong out-of-plane pressure. Then follows a strong stopping and the built up of an in-plane pressure. The $v_2$, created by both processes, compensate to a large extend. The finally observed $v_2$ is caused by the potential, reflects the freeze-out geometry and can neither be associated to squeeze-out nor to shadowing.
  The results are highly relevant for experiments at GSI, RHIC-FXT and the upcoming FAIR facility, but also for experiments at FRIB, and strengthens understanding on the Equation-of-State at large baryon densities.</description>

      <title>Examining the potential synthesis of new elements with $^{294}$Og</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the relentless pursuit of expanding the periodic table, the discovery of element 119 remains elusive, despite two decades of dedicated research efforts. The traditional fusion-evaporation approach, although fruitful in the past, now appears to be approaching its operational limits. This scenario sets the stage for considering innovative methodologies essential for further advancements in the field of superheavy elements. Here, we introduce a pioneering strategy aimed at synthesizing element 119 by adapting and extending the nuclear reaction processes previously successful in producing element $^{294}$Og. This involved the fusion of $^{48}$Ca and $^{249}$Cf. Building on this, our novel approach incorporates an additional reactive target -- specifically, hydrogen -- positioned strategically behind the $^{249}$Cf. This configuration is designed to facilitate an immediate secondary reaction of the nascent $^{294}$Og with hydrogen, potentially forging new pathways to element 119. Preliminary insights also suggest that employing isotopes like deuterium or helium-3 as targets may not only enhance the production rates of element 119 but might also pave the way for the synthesis of even heavier elements, extending up to elements 120 and 121. We delve into the technicalities and feasibility of employing a dual-target method using a $^{48}$Ca beam, exploring new horizons in the quest for the superheavy unknown.</description>

      <title>Qualitative and quantitative detection of the QCD phase-transition boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this compelling study, we delve into the intricate relationship between the Equation of State (EoS) that encompasses a ``QGP-like'' phase transition and the directed flow ($v_1$) of protons and $\Lambda$ particles, specifically at beam energies under 10 GeV. Utilizing the sophisticated Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT-HC) model, our analysis not only resonates with the STAR experimental data but also reveals striking dips in the directed flow strength for both types of particles as the collision energy is ramped up. These pronounced features, which are more noticeable across various phase-transition regions within the EoS, offer invaluable insights into the presence and detailed nature of the QCD phase transition. Our findings underline the critical role of directed flow measurements in beam energy scans as effective instruments for probing and understanding the phase structure of nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions, highlighting their potential to unlock new frontiers in high-energy nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring hadron-quark phase transition in heavy-ion collisions using particle emission ratios in heavy and light reaction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the AMPT model, which incorporates both hadronic and quark degrees of freedom, we studied the productions of lambda, kaon, proton, and pion in reaction systems $^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca+$^{48}$Ca, and $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au. It is found that the ratios of identical particle emissions from heavy and light reaction systems, especially the emission ratios of strange particles $\Lambda^{0}$ or K$^{+}$ in heavy and light reaction systems, are highly sensitive to the hadron-quark phase transition in heavy-ion collisions. Detailed explanations of these results and validations using the PACIAE model are given.</description>

      <title>Novel features of asymmetric nuclear matter from large neutron skin thickness and small neutron-star radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate measurement of neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb by the PREX Collaboration suggests a large value of the nuclear symmetry energy slope parameter, $L$, whereas the smaller $L$ is preferred to account for the small neutron-star radii from NICER observations. To resolve this discrepancy between nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, new effective interactions have been developed using relativistic mean-field models with the isoscalar- and isovector-meson mixing. We investigate the effects of $\delta$-nucleon coupling and $\sigma$--$\delta$ mixing on the ground-state properties of finite nuclei, as well as the characteristics of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter and neutron stars. Additionally, we explore the role of the quartic $\rho$-meson self-interaction in dense nuclear matter to mitigate the stiff equation of state for neutron stars resulting from the large $\delta$-nucleon coupling. It is found that the nuclear symmetry energy undergoes a sudden softening at approximately twice the saturation density of nuclear matter, taking into account the PREX-2 result, the recent NICER observation of PSR J0437$-$4715, and the binary neutron star merger, GW170817.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being closely connected to the origin of the nucleon mass, the gravitational form factors of the nucleon have attracted significant attention in recent years. We present the first model-independent precise determinations of the gravitational form factors of the pion and nucleon at the physical pion mass, using a data-driven dispersive approach. The so-called ``last unknown global property'' of the nucleon, the $D$-term, is determined to be $-\left(3.38^{+0.26}_{-0.32}\right)$. The root mean square radius of the mass distribution inside the nucleon is determined to be $0.97^{+0.02}_{-0.03}~\text{fm}$. Notably, this value is larger than the proton charge radius, suggesting a modern structural view of the nucleon where gluons, responsible for most of the nucleon mass, are distributed over a larger spatial region than quarks, which dominate the charge distribution. We also predict the nucleon angular momentum and mechanical radii, providing further insights into the intricate internal structure of the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\gamma$-rays generated by neutron interaction with ${}^{16}$O at 30 MeV and 250 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep understanding of $\gamma$-ray production from the fast neutron reaction in water is crucial for various physics studies at large-scale water Cherenkov detectors. We performed test experiments using quasi-mono energetic neutron beams ($E_n = 30$ and 250~MeV) at Osaka University's Research Center for Nuclear Physics to measure $\gamma$-rays originating from the neutron-oxygen reaction with a high-purity germanium detector. Multiple $\gamma$-ray peaks which are expected to be from excited nuclei after the neutron-oxygen reaction were successfully observed. We measured the neutron beam flux by using a liquid scintillator for the cross section measurement. With a spectral fitting analysis based on the tailored $\gamma$-ray signal and background templates, we measured cross sections for each observed $\gamma$-ray component. The results will be useful to validate neutron models employed in the on-going and future water Cherenkov experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigating the fission-like fragments in the $^{12}$C + $^{208}$Pb system at E$^{\star}$ $\approx$ 31.8--45.4 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the cross-sections of 27 fission-like fragments within the mass range 76$\leq$A$\leq$141, expected to be populated via fission of moderately excited compound nucleus produced as a result of complete and/or incomplete fusion in $^{12}$C+$^{208}$Pb reaction at E$_{\rm lab}$ = 81.9 and 75.8 MeV, have been measured using activation technique followed by offline $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. The yields of different fission-like fragments have been analyzed to generate isotopic and isobaric yield distributions. The value of the mass dispersion parameter, $\sigma^2_A$, is found to be 2.93 and 2.65 for Antimony (Sb) isotope at excitation energy E$^{\star}$ = 45.4 and 39.6 MeV, and 1.24 for Indium (In) isotope at E$^{\star}$ = 45.4 MeV. The charge dispersion parameter $\sigma_Z$ for Sb is estimated to be 0.769 and 0.714 at E$^{\star}$ = 45.4 and 39.6 MeV, respectively. For In isotopes, the value of $\sigma_Z$ is estimated to be 0.430 at E$^{\star}$ = 45.4 MeV. The value of mass and charge dispersion parameters for Sb and In isotopes have been found to be in good agreement with the values reported in the literature for similar systems. The mass distribution of fission-like fragments is found to be fitted with a Gaussian function, except for a few data points, indicating their population via compound nucleus fission. Further, the mass variance ($\sigma^2_M$) displays linear increment with an increase in excitation energy. Two medically important isotopes, $^{99m}$Tc and $^{111}$In, are populated in this system, suggesting a potential formation route.</description>
