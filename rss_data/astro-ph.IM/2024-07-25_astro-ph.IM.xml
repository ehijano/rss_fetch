      <title>Exo-NINJA at Subaru: fiber-fed spectro-imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar disks at R$\sim$4000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exo-NINJA will realize nearIR R$\sim$4000 diffraction-limited narrow-field spectro-imaging for characterization of exoplanets and circumstellar disk structures. It uniquely combines mid-R spectroscopy, high throughput, and spatial resolution, in contrast to CHARIS, which does spectro-imaging, and REACH, which is single-point (no spatial resolution). Exo-NINJA's spectro-imaging at the telescope diffraction limit will characterize exoplanet atmospheres, detect and map (spatially and spectrally) gas accretion on protoplanets, and also detect exoplanets at small angular separation ($\lambda$/D) from their host star by spectro-astrometry. Exo-NINJA will link two instruments at the Subaru Telescope using a high-throughput hexagonal multi-mode fiber bundle (hexabundle). The fiber coupling resides between the high contrast imaging system SCExAO, which combines ExAO and coronagraph, and the medium-resolution spectrograph NINJA (R$=$4000 at JHK bands). Exo-NINJA will provide an end-to-end throughput of 20% compared to the 1.5% obtained with REACH. Exo-NINJA is scheduled for implementation on the Subaru Telescope's NasIR platform in 2025; we will present a concise overview of its future installation, laboratory tests such as the throughput and focal ratio degradation (FRD) performance of optical fiber imaging hexabundles, in the NIR and the trade-offs for fiber choices for the NINJA-SCExAO hexabundle fiber cable, and the expected on sky performance.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating sub-electron noise performance in Single electron Sensitive Readout (SiSeRO) devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single electron Sensitive Read Out (SiSeRO) is a novel on-chip charge detection technology that can, in principle, provide significantly greater responsivity and improved noise performance than traditional charge coupled device (CCD) readout circuitry. The SiSeRO, developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, uses a p-MOSFET transistor with a depleted back-gate region under the transistor channel; as charge is transferred into the back gate region, the transistor current is modulated. With our first generation SiSeRO devices, we previously achieved a responsivity of around 800 pA per electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of 4.5 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral resolution of 130 eV at 5.9 keV, at a readout speed of 625 Kpixel/s and for a detector temperature of 250 K. Importantly, since the charge signal remains unaffected by the SiSeRO readout process, we have also been able to implement Repetitive Non-Destructive Readout (RNDR), achieving an improved ENC performance. In this paper, we demonstrate sub-electron noise sensitivity with these devices, utilizing an enhanced test setup optimized for RNDR measurements, with excellent temperature control, improved readout circuitry, and advanced digital filtering techniques. We are currently fabricating new SiSeRO detectors with more sensitive and RNDR-optimized amplifier designs, which will help mature the SiSeRO technology in the future and eventually lead to the pathway to develop active pixel sensor (APS) arrays using sensitive SiSeRO amplifiers on each pixel. Active pixel devices with sub-electron sensitivity and fast readout present an exciting option for next generation, large area astronomical X-ray telescopes requiring fast, low-noise megapixel imagers.</description>

      <title>The XOC X-ray Beamline: Probing Colder, Quieter, and Softer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future strategic X-ray satellite telescopes, such as the probe-class Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), will require excellent soft energy response in their imaging detectors to enable maximum discovery potential. In order to characterize Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) and Single Electron Sensitive Read Output (SiSeRO) detectors in the soft X-ray region, the X-ray Astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) group at Stanford has developed, assembled, and commissioned a 2.5-meter-long X-ray beamline test system. The beamline is designed to efficiently produce monoenergetic X-ray fluorescence lines in the 0.3-10 keV energy range and achieve detector temperatures as low as 173 K. We present design and simulation details of the beamline, and discuss the vacuum, cooling, and X-ray fluorescence performance achieved. As a workhorse for future detector characterization at Stanford, the XOC beamline will support detector development for a broad range of X-ray astronomy instruments.</description>

      <title>X-ray speed reading with the MCRC: prototype success and next generation upgrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) is a NASA probe class mission concept designed to deliver arcsecond resolution with an effective area ten times that of Chandra (at launch). The AXIS focal plane features an MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) detector working in conjunction with an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), denoted the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC). While this readout ASIC targets the AXIS mission, it is applicable to a range of potential X-ray missions with comparable readout requirements. Designed by the X-ray astronomy and Observational Cosmology (XOC) group at Stanford University, the MCRC ASIC prototype (MCRC-V1.0) uses a 350 nm technology node and provides 8 channels of high speed, low noise, low power consumption readout electronics. Each channel implements a current source to bias the detector output driver, a preamplifier to provide gain, and an output buffer to interface directly to an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter. The MCRC-V1 ASIC exhibits comparable performance to our best discrete electronics implementations, but with ten times less power consumption and a fraction of the footprint area. In a total ionizing dose (TID) test, the chip demonstrated a radiation hardness equal or greater to 25 krad, confirming the suitability of the process technology and layout techniques used in its design. The next iteration of the ASIC (MCRC-V2) will expand the channel count and extend the interfaces to external circuits, advancing its readiness as a readout-on-a-chip solution for next generation X-ray CCD-like detectors. This paper summarizes our most recent characterization efforts, including the TID radiation campaign and results from the first operation of the MCRC ASIC in combination with a representative MIT-LL CCD.</description>

      <title>Continued developments in X-ray speed reading: fast, low noise readout for next-generation wide-field imagers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future strategic X-ray astronomy missions will require unprecedentedly sensitive wide-field imagers providing high frame rates, low readout noise and excellent soft energy response. To meet these needs, our team is employing a multi-pronged approach to advance several key areas of technology. Our first focus is on advanced readout electronics, specifically integrated electronics, where we are collaborating on the VERITAS readout chip for the Athena Wide Field Imager, and have developed the Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC), which enables fast readout and high frame rates for MIT-LL JFET (junction field effect transistor) CCDs. Second, we are contributing to novel detector development, specifically the SiSeRO (Single electron Sensitive Read Out) devices fabricated at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and their advanced readout, to achieve sub-electron noise performance. Hardware components set the stage for performance, but their efficient utilization relies on software and algorithms for signal and event processing. Our group is developing digital waveform filtering and AI methods to augment detector performance, including enhanced particle background screening and improved event characterization. All of these efforts make use of an efficient, new X-ray beamline facility at Stanford, where components and concepts can be tested and characterized.</description>

      <title>Augmenting astronomical X-ray detectors with AI for enhanced sensitivity and reduced background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bringing artificial intelligence (AI) alongside next-generation X-ray imaging detectors, including CCDs and DEPFET sensors, enhances their sensitivity to achieve many of the flagship science cases targeted by future X-ray observatories, based upon low surface brightness and high redshift sources. Machine learning algorithms operating on the raw frame-level data provide enhanced identification of background vs. astrophysical X-ray events, by considering all of the signals in the context within which they appear within each frame. We have developed prototype machine learning algorithms to identify valid X-ray and cosmic-ray induced background events, trained and tested upon a suite of realistic end-to-end simulations that trace the interaction of cosmic ray particles and their secondaries through the spacecraft and detector. These algorithms demonstrate that AI can reduce the unrejected instrumental background by up to 41.5 per cent compared with traditional filtering methods. Alongside AI algorithms to reduce the instrumental background, next-generation event reconstruction methods, based upon fitting physically-motivated Gaussian models of the charge clouds produced by events within the detector, promise increased accuracy and spectral resolution of the lowest energy photon events.</description>

      <title>Towards efficient machine-learning-based reduction of the cosmic-ray induced background in X-ray imaging detectors: increasing context awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional cosmic ray filtering algorithms used in X-ray imaging detectors aboard space telescopes perform event reconstruction based on the properties of activated pixels above a certain energy threshold, within 3x3 or 5x5 pixel sliding windows. This approach can reject up to 98% of the cosmic ray background. However, the remaining unrejected background constitutes a significant impediment to studies of low surface brightness objects, which are especially prevalent in the high-redshift universe. The main limitation of the traditional filtering algorithms is their ignorance of the long-range contextual information present in image frames. This becomes particularly problematic when analyzing signals created by secondary particles produced during interactions of cosmic rays with body of the detector. Such signals may look identical to the energy deposition left by X-ray photons, when one considers only the properties within the small sliding window. Additional information is present, however, in the spatial and energy correlations between signals in different parts of the frame, which can be accessed by modern machine learning (ML) techniques. In this work, we continue the development of an ML-based pipeline for cosmic ray background mitigation. Our latest method consist of two stages: first, a frame classification neural network is used to create class activation maps (CAM), localizing all events within the frame; second, after event reconstruction, a random forest classifier, using features obtained from CAMs, is used to separate X-ray and cosmic ray features. The method delivers &gt;40% relative improvement over traditional filtering in background rejection in standard 0.3-10keV energy range, at the expense of only a small (&lt;2%) level of lost X-ray signal. Our method also provides a convenient way to tune the cosmic ray rejection threshold to adapt to a user's specific scientific needs.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding interactions between the AO system and segment co-phasing with the vector-Zernike wavefront sensor on Keck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous demonstration of the first on-sky primary mirror segment closed-loop control on Keck using a vector-Zernike wavefront sensor (vZWFS), which improved the Strehl ratio on the NIRC2 science camera by up to 10 percentage points. Segment co-phasing errors contribute to Keck contrast limits and will be necessary to correct for the segmented Extremely Large Telescopes and future space missions. The goal of the post-AO vZWFS on Keck is to monitor and correct segment co-phasing errors in parallel with science observations. The ZWFS is ideal for measuring phase discontinuities and is one of the most sensitive WFSs, but has limited dynamic range. The Keck vZWFS consists of a metasurface mask imposing two different phase shifts to orthogonal polarizations, split into two pupil images, extending its dynamic range. We report on the vZWFS closed-loop co-phasing performance and early work towards understanding the interactions between the AO system and segment phasing. We discuss a comparison of the AO performance when co-phasing by aligning segment edges, as is currently done at Keck, compared with aligning to the average phase over the segments, as is done by the vZWFS.</description>

      <title>TelescopeML -- I. An End-to-End Python Package for Interpreting Telescope Datasets through Training Machine Learning Models, Generating Statistical Reports, and Visualizing Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are on the verge of a revolutionary era in space exploration, thanks to advancements in telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}). High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra from exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres have been collected over the past few decades, requiring the development of accurate and reliable pipelines and tools for their analysis. Accurately and swiftly determining the spectroscopic parameters from the observational spectra of these objects is crucial for understanding their atmospheric composition and guiding future follow-up observations. \texttt{TelescopeML} is a Python package developed to perform three main tasks: 1. Process the synthetic astronomical datasets for training a CNN model and prepare the observational dataset for later use for prediction; 2. Train a CNN model by implementing the optimal hyperparameters; and 3. Deploy the trained CNN models on the actual observational data to derive the output spectroscopic parameters.</description>

      <title>SUIM project: measuring the upper atmosphere from the ISS by observations of the CXB transmitted through the Earth rim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper atmosphere at the altitude of 60-110 km, the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), has the least observational data of all atmospheres due to the difficulties of in-situ observations. Previous studies demonstrated that atmospheric occultation of cosmic X-ray sources is an effective technique to investigate the MLT. Aiming to measure the atmospheric density of the MLT continuously, we are developing an X-ray camera, "Soipix for observing Upper atmosphere as Iss experiment Mission (SUIM)", dedicated to atmospheric observations. SUIM will be installed on the exposed area of the International Space Station (ISS) and face the ram direction of the ISS to point toward the Earth rim. Observing the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) transmitted through the atmosphere, we will measure the absorption column density via spectroscopy and thus obtain the density of the upper atmosphere. The X-ray camera is composed of a slit collimator and two X-ray SOI-CMOS pixel sensors (SOIPIX), and will stand on its own and make observations, controlled by a CPU-embedded FPGA "Zynq". We plan to install the SUIM payload on the ISS in 2025 during the solar maximum. In this paper, we report the overview and the development status of this project.</description>

      <title>Simulation study of performance of the Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Very Large Area gamma-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) is a mission concept proposed to detect gamma-ray photons through both the Compton scattering and electron-positron pair production mechanisms, enabling the detection of photons with energies ranging from MeV to TeV. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive survey of the gamma-ray sky from a low Earth orbit using an anti-coincidence detector, a tracker detector that also serves as a low energy calorimeter, and a high energy imaging calorimeter. We developed a Monte Carlo simulation application of the detector with the GEANT4 toolkit to evaluate the instrument performance including the effective area, angular resolution and energy resolution, as well as explored specific optimizations of the detector configuration. Our simulation-based analysis indicates that the VLAST's current design is physically feasible, with an acceptance larger than 10~$\rm m^2\ sr$ which is four times larger than Fermi-LAT, an energy resolution better than 2\% at 10~GeV, and an angular resolution better than 0.2 degrees at 10~GeV. The VLAST project is expected to make significant contribution to the field of gamma-ray astronomy and to enhance our understanding of the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Commissioning the CMB polarization telescope GroundBIRD with the full set of detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GroundBIRD is a ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment for observing the polarization pattern imprinted on large angular scales ($\ell &gt; 6$ ) from the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Spain. Our primary scientific objective is a precise measurement of the optical depth $\tau$ ($\sigma(\tau) \sim 0.01$) to the reionization epoch of the Universe to cross-check systematic effects in the measurements made by previous experiments. GroundBIRD observes a wide sky area in the Northern Hemisphere ($\sim 40\%$ of the full sky) while continuously rotating the telescope at a high speed of up to 20 rotations per minute (rpm) to overcome the fluctuations of atmospheric radiation. We have adopted the NbTiN/Al hybrid microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) as focal plane detectors. We observe two frequency bands centered at 145 GHz and 220 GHz. The 145 GHz band picks up the peak frequency of the CMB spectrum. The 220 GHz band helps accurate removal of the contamination of thermal emission from the Galactic interstellar dust. The MKID arrays (138 MKIDs for 145GHz and 23 MKIDs for 220GHz) were designed and optimized so as to minimize the contamination of the two-level-system noise and maximize the sensitivity. The MKID arrays were successfully installed in May 2023 after the performance verification tests were performed at a laboratory. GroundBIRD has been upgraded to use the full MKID arrays, and scientific observations are now underway. The telescope is automated, so that all observations are performed remotely. Initial validations, including polarization response tests and observations of Jupiter and the moon, have been completed successfully. We are now running scientific observations.</description>

      <title>Method to search for inspiraling planetary-mass ultra-compact binaries using the generalized frequency-Hough transform in LIGO O3a data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from sub-solar mass primordial black holes could be detected in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data. Here, we apply a method originally designed to look for rapidly spinning-down neutron stars, the generalized frequency-Hough transform, to search for planetary-mass primordial black holes using data from the first half of the third observing run of advanced LIGO. In this companion paper to arXiv:2402.19468, in which the main results of our search are presented, we delve into the details of the search methodology, the choices we have made regarding the parameter space to explore, the follow-up procedure we use to confirm or reject possible candidates returned in our search, and a comparison of our analytic procedure of generating upper limits to those obtained through injections.</description>

      <title>Development of the observatory software for the SKAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Observatory Science Operations (OSO) subsystem of the SKAO consists of a range of complex tools which will be used to propose, design, schedule and execute observations. Bridging the gap between the science and telescope domains is the key responsibility of OSO, requiring considerations of usability, performance, availability and accessibility, amongst others. This paper describes the state of the observatory software as we approach construction milestones, how the applications meet these requirements using a modern technology architecture, and challenges so far.</description>

      <title>SKAO Observation Execution Tool: Designing for concurrent, responsive observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SKA Observatory, currently in the construction phase, will have two of the world's largest radio telescopes when completed in 2028. The scale of the project introduces unique challenges for the telescope software design and implementation at all levels, from user interfacing software down to the lower-level control of individual telescope elements. The Observation Execution Tool (OET) is part of the Observation Science Operations (OSO) suite of applications and is responsible for orchestrating the highest level of telescope control through the execution of telescope control scripts. One of the main challenges for the OET is creating a design that can robustly run concurrent observations on multiple subarrays while remaining responsive to the user. The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) development process followed by the SKA project also means the software should be allow to iterative implementation and easily accommodate new and changing requirements. This paper concentrates on the design decisions and challenges in the development of the OET, how we have solved some of the specific technical problems and details on how we remain flexible for future requirements.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) is a project dedicated to identifying optical counter-parts to gravitational-wave detections using a network of dedicated, wide-field telescopes. After almost a decade of design, construction, and commissioning work, the GOTO network is now fully operational with two antipodal sites: La Palma in the Canary Islands and Siding Spring in Australia. Both sites host two independent robotic mounts, each with a field-of-view of 44 square degrees formed by an array of eight 40 cm telescopes, resulting in an instantaneous 88 square degree field-of-view per site. All four telescopes operate as a single integrated network, with the ultimate aim of surveying the entire sky every 2-3 days and allowing near-24-hour response to transient events within a minute of their detection. In the modern era of transient astronomy, automated telescopes like GOTO form a vital link between multi-messenger discovery facilities and in-depth follow-up by larger telescopes. GOTO is already producing a wide range of scientific results, assisted by an efficient discovery pipeline and a successful citizen science project: Kilonova Seekers.</description>

      <title>Asgard/NOTT: water vapor and CO$_2$ atmospheric dispersion compensation system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To leverage the angular resolution of interferometry at high contrast, one must employ specialized beam-combiners called interferometric nullers. Nullers discard part of the astrophysical information to optimize the recording of light present in the dark fringe of the central source. Asgard/NOTT will deploy a beam-combination scheme offering good instrumental noise rejection when phased appropriately, but for which information is degenerate on the outputs, prompting a dedicated tuning strategy using the science detector. The dispersive effect of water vapor can be corrected with prisms forming a variable thickness of glass. But observations in the L band suffer from an additional and important chromatic effect due to longitudinal atmospheric dispersion coming from a resonance of CO2 at 4.3 micron. To compensate for this effect efficiently, a novel type of compensation device will be deployed leveraging a gas cell of variable length at ambient pressure. After reviewing the impact of water vapor and CO2, we present the design of this atmospheric dispersion compensation device and describe a strategy to maintain this tuning on-sky.</description>

      <title>VLTI Unit Telescope coud\'e train vibration control upgrade for GRAVITY+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up interferometry to 8m collectors should smooth-out the optical piston perturbations and allow a slow fringe tracker to obtain high precision correction on faint targets. In practice, the GRAVITY fringe tracker still observes high frequency OPD components that limit the exposure time, its precision and limiting magnitude. Perturbations seem to come from mechanical vibrations in the train of mirrors. As part of the GRAVITY+ efforts, accelerometers were added to all the mirrors of the coud\'e train to compensate in real-time the optical path using the main delay lines. We show their effectiveness on vibrations peaks between 40 and 200Hz and outline prospects for the upgrade of the deformable mirrors and the beam-compressor differential delay lines.</description>

      <title>Walking with SOXS towards the transient sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter) is the new ESO instrument that is going to be installed on the 3.58-m New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory. SOXS is a single object spectrograph offering a wide simultaneous spectral coverage from U- to H-band. Although such an instrument may have potentially a large variety of applications, the consortium designed it with a clear science case: it is going to provide the spectroscopic counterparts to the ongoing and upcoming imaging surveys, becoming one of the main follow-up instruments in the Southern hemisphere for the classification and characterization of transients. The NTT+SOXS system is specialized to observe all transients and variable sources discovered by imaging surveys with a flexible schedule maintained by the consortium, based on a remote scheduler which will interface with the observatory software infrastructure. SOXS is realized timely to be highly synergic with transients discovery machines like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The instrument has been integrated and tested in Italy, collecting and assembling subsystems coming from all partners spread over six countries in three continents. The first preparatory activities in Chile have been completed at the telescope. This article gives an updated status of the project before the shipping of the instrument to Chile.</description>

Abstract: The Instrument Control Software of SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter), the forthcoming spectrograph for the ESO New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory, has reached a mature state of development and is approaching the crucial Preliminary Acceptance in Europe phase. Now that all the subsystems have been integrated in the laboratories of the Padova Astronomical Observatory, the team operates for testing purposes with the whole instrument at both engineering and scientific level. These activities will make use of a set of software peculiarities that will be discussed in this contribution. In particular, we focus on the synoptic panel, the co-rotator system special device, on the Active Flexure Compensation system which controls two separate piezo tip-tilt devices.</description>

      <title>SOXS NIR: Optomechanical integration and alignment, optical performance verification before full instrument assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the opto-mechanical integration and alignment, functional and optical performance verification of the NIR arm of Son Of X-Shooter (SOXS) instrument. SOXS will be a single object spectroscopic facility for the ESO-NTT 3.6-m telescope, made by two arms high efficiency spectrographs, able to cover the spectral range 350 2050 nm with a mean resolving power R~4500. In particular the NIR arm is a cryogenic echelle cross-dispersed spectrograph spanning the 780-2050 nm range. We describe the integration and alignment method performed to assemble the different opto-mechanical elements and their installation on the NIR vacuum vessel, which mostly relies on mechanical characterization. The tests done to assess the image quality, linear dispersion and orders trace in laboratory conditions are summarized. The full optical performance verification, namely echellogram format, image quality and resulting spectral resolving power in the whole NIR arm (optical path and science detector) is detailed. Such verification is one of the most relevant prerequisites for the subsequent full instrument assembly and provisional acceptance in Europe milestone, foreseen in 2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SOXS spectrograph, designed for the ESO NTT telescope, operates in both the optical (UV-VIS: 350-850 nm) and NIR (800-2000 nm) bands. This article provides an overview of the final tests conducted on the UV-VIS camera system using a telescope simulator. It details the system's performance evaluation, including key metrics such as gain, readout noise, and linearity, and highlights the advancements made in the upgraded acquisition system. The testing process, conducted in the Padua laboratory, involved comprehensive simulations of the telescope environment to ensure the results closely resemble those expected at the ESO-NTT telescope. The successful completion of these tests confirms the system's readiness for deployment to Chile, where it will be installed on the NTT telescope, marking a significant milestone in the SOXS project.</description>

      <title>Automated scheduler for the SOXS instrument: design and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17262v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the advancements in the development of the scheduler for the Son Of X-shooter instrument at the ESO-NTT 3.58-m telescope in La Silla, Chile. SOXS is designed as a single-object spectroscopic facility and features a high-efficiency spectrograph with two arms covering the spectral range of 350-2000 nm and a mean resolving power of approximately R=4500. It will conduct UV-visible and near-infrared follow-up observations of astrophysical transients, drawing from a broad pool of targets accessible through the streaming services of wide-field telescopes, both current and future, as well as high-energy satellites. The instrument will cater to various scientific objectives within the astrophysical community, each entailing specific requirements for observation planning. SOXS will operate at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in La Silla, without the presence of astronomers on the mountain. This poses a unique challenge for the scheduling process, demanding a fully automated algorithm that is autonomously interacting with the appropriate databases and the La Silla Weather API, and is capable of presenting the operator not only with an ordered list of optimal targets (in terms of observing constraints) but also with optimal backups in the event of changing weather conditions. This imposes the necessity for a scheduler with rapid-response capabilities without compromising the optimization process, ensuring the high quality of observations and best use of the time at the telescope. We thus developed a new highly available and scalable architecture, implementing API Restful applications like Docker Containers, API Gateway, and Python-based Flask frameworks. We provide an overview of the current state of the scheduler, which is now ready for the approaching on-site testing during Commissioning phase, along with insights into its web interface and preliminary performance tests.</description>

Abstract: The Son Of X-Shooter (SOXS) is a single object spectrograph, built by an international consortium for the 3.58-m ESO New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory [1]. It offers a simultaneous spectral coverage over 350-2000 nm, with two separate spectrographs. In this paper we present the status of the Near InfraRed (NIR) cryogenic echelle cross-dispersed spectrograph [1], in the range 0.80-2.00 {\mu}m with 15 orders, equipped with an 2k x 2k Hawaii H2RG IR array from Teledyne, working at 40K, that is currently assembled and tested on the SOXS instrument, in the premises of INAF in Padova. We describe the different tests and results of the cryo, vacuum, opto-mechanics and detector subsystems that finally will be part of the PAE by ESO.</description>

      <title>What is your favorite transient event? SOXS is almost ready to observe!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Son Of X-Shooter (SOXS) will be the specialized facility to observe any transient event with a flexible scheduler at the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla, Chile. SOXS is a single object spectrograph offering simultaneous spectral coverage in UV-VIS (350-850 nm) and NIR (800-2000 nm) wavelength regimes with an average of R~4500 for a 1arcsec slit. SOXS also has imaging capabilities in the visible wavelength regime. Currently, SOXS is being integrated at the INAF-Astronomical Observatory of Padova. Subsystem- and system-level tests and verification are ongoing to ensure and confirm that every requirement and performance are met. In this paper, we report on the integration and verification of SOXS as the team and the instrument prepare for the Preliminary Acceptance Europe (PAE).</description>

      <title>Population-level Dark Energy Constraints from Strong Gravitational Lensing using Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a scalable approach for inferring the dark energy equation-of-state parameter ($w$) from a population of strong gravitational lens images using Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). Strong gravitational lensing offers crucial insights into cosmology, but traditional Monte Carlo methods for cosmological inference are computationally prohibitive and inadequate for processing the thousands of lenses anticipated from future cosmic surveys. New tools for inference, such as SBI using Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE), address this challenge effectively. By training a machine learning model on simulated data of strong lenses, we can learn the likelihood-to-evidence ratio for robust inference. Our scalable approach enables more constrained population-level inference of $w$ compared to individual lens analysis, constraining $w$ to within $1\sigma$. Our model can be used to provide cosmological constraints from forthcoming strong lens surveys, such as the 4MOST Strong Lensing Spectroscopic Legacy Survey (4SLSLS), which is expected to observe 10,000 strong lenses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter) is the new single object spectrograph for the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) at the La Silla Observatory, able to cover simultaneously both the UV-VIS and NIR bands (350-2000 nm). The instrument is currently in the integration and test phase, approaching the Preliminary Acceptance in Europe (PAE) before shipment to Chile for commissioning. After the assembly and preliminary test of the control electronics at INAF - Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte (Napoli), the two main control cabinets of SOXS are now hosted in Padova, connected to the real hardware. This contribution describes the final electronic cabinets layout, the control strategy and the different integration phases, waiting for the Preliminary Acceptance in Europe and the installation of the instrument in Chile.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray susceptibility of the Terahertz Intensity Mapper detector arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the effects of cosmic ray interactions with the Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) based focal plane array for the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM). TIM is a NASA-funded balloon-borne experiment designed to probe the peak of the star formation in the Universe. It employs two spectroscopic bands, each equipped with a focal plane of four $\sim\,$900-pixel, KID-based array chips. Measurements of an 864-pixel TIM array shows 791 resonators in a 0.5$\,$GHz bandwidth. We discuss challenges with resonator calibration caused by this high multiplexing density. We robustly identify the physical positions of 788 (99.6$\,$%) detectors using a custom LED-based identification scheme. Using this information we show that cosmic ray events occur at a rate of 2.1$\,\mathrm{events/min/cm^2}$ in our array. 66$\,$% of the events affect a single pixel, and another 33$\,$% affect $&lt;\,$5 KIDs per event spread over a 0.66$\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ region (2 pixel pitches in radius). We observe a total cosmic ray dead fraction of 0.0011$\,$%, and predict that the maximum possible in-flight dead fraction is $\sim\,$0.165$\,$%, which demonstrates our design will be robust against these high-energy events.</description>

      <title>Final Alignment and Image Quality Test for the Acquisition and Guiding System of SOXS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter) will be the new medium-resolution (R 4500 for 1 slit), high-efficiency, wide-band spectrograph for the ESO NTT at La Silla Observatory, Chile. It will be dedicated to the follow-up of any kind of transient events, ensuring fast time, high efficiency, and availability. It consists of a central structure (common path) that supports two spectrographs optimized for the UV-Visible and a Near-Infrared range. Attached to the common path is the Acquisition and Guiding Camera system (AC), equipped with a filter wheel that can provide science-grade imaging and moderate high-speed photometry. The AC Unit was integrated and aligned during the summer months of 2022 and has since been mounted in the NTTs telescope simulator. This work gives an update on the Acquisition Camera Unit status, describes the Image Quality Tests that were performed, and discusses the AC Optical Performance.</description>

      <title>Variable Star Light Curves in Koopman Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of data-driven techniques for dynamical system analysis based on Koopman theory to variable stars. We focus on light curves of RRLyrae type variables, in the Galactic globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri. Light curves are thus summarized by a handful of complex eigenvalues, corresponding to oscillatory or fading dynamical modes. We find that variable stars of the RRc subclass can be summarized in terms of fewer ($\approx 8$) eigenvalues, while RRab need comparatively more ($\approx 12$). This result can be leveraged for classification and reflects the simpler structure of RRc light curves. We then consider variable stars displaying secular variations due to the Tseraskaya-Blazhko effect and find a change in relevant eigenvalues with time, with possible implications for the physical interpretation of the effect.</description>

      <title>KMT-2021-BLG-2609Lb and KMT-2022-BLG-0303Lb: Microlensing planets identified through signals produced by major-image perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate microlensing data collected by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of two lensing events, KMT-2021-BLG-2609 and KMT-2022-BLG-0303, exhibit a similar anomaly, in which short-term positive deviations appear on the sides of the low-magnification lensing light curves. To unravel the nature of these anomalies, we meticulously analyze each of the lensing events. Our investigations reveal that these anomalies stem from a shared channel, wherein the source passed near the planetary caustic induced by a planet with projected separations from the host star exceeding the Einstein radius. We find that interpreting the anomaly of KMT-2021-BLG-2609 is complicated by the "inner--outer" degeneracy, whereas for KMT-2022-BLG-0303, there is no such issue despite similar lens-system configurations. In addition to this degeneracy, interpreting the anomaly in KMT-2021-BLG-2609 involves an additional degeneracy between a pair of solutions, in which the source partially envelops the caustic and the other three solutions in which the source fully envelopes the caustic. As in an earlier case of this so-called von Schlieffen--Cannae degeneracy, the former solutions have substantially higher mass ratio. Through Bayesian analyses conducted based on the measured lensing observables of the event time scale and angular Einstein radius, the host of KMT-2021-BLG-2609L is determined to be a low-mass star with a mass $\sim 0.2~M_\odot$ in terms of a median posterior value, while the planet's mass ranges from approximately 0.032 to 0.112 times that of Jupiter, depending on the solutions. For the planetary system KMT-2022-BLG-0303L, it features a planet with a mass of approximately $0.51~M_{\rm J}$ and a host star with a mass of about $0.37~M_\odot$. In both cases, the lenses are most likely situated in the bulge.</description>

Abstract: The Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM) is designed to probe the star formation history in dust-obscured star-forming galaxies around the peak of cosmic star formation. This will be done via measurements of the redshifted 157.7 um line of singly ionized carbon ([CII]). TIM employs two R $\sim 250$ long-slit grating spectrometers covering 240-420 um. Each is equipped with a focal plane unit containing 4 wafer-sized subarrays of horn-coupled aluminum kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). We present the design and performance of a prototype focal plane assembly for one of TIM's KID-based subarrays. Our design strictly maintain high optical efficiency and a suitable electromagnetic environment for the KIDs. The prototype detector housing in combination with the first flight-like quadrant are tested at 250 mK. Initial frequency scan shows that many resonances are affected by collisions and/or very shallow transmission dips as a result of a degraded internal quality factor (Q factor). This is attributed to the presence of an external magnetic field during cooldown. We report on a study of magnetic field dependence of the Q factor of our quadrant array. We implement a Helmholtz coil to vary the magnetic field at the detectors by (partially) nulling earth's. Our investigation shows that the earth magnetic field can significantly affect our KIDs' performance by degrading the Q factor by a factor of 2-5, well below those expected from the operational temperature or optical loading. We find that we can sufficiently recover our detectors' quality factor by tuning the current in the coils to generate a field that matches earth's magnetic field in magnitude to within a few uT. Therefore, it is necessary to employ a properly designed magnetic shield enclosing the TIM focal plane unit. Based on the results presented in this paper, we set a shielding requirement of |B| &lt; 3 uT.</description>

Abstract: We report on the kinetic inductance detector (KID) array focal plane assembly design for the Terahertz Intensity Mapper (TIM). Each of the 2 arrays consists of 4 wafer-sized dies (quadrants), and the overall assembly must satisfy thermal and mechanical requirements, while maintaining high optical efficiency and a suitable electromagnetic environment for the KIDs. In particular, our design manages to strictly maintain a 50 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ air gap between the array and the horn block. We have prototyped and are now testing a sub-scale assembly which houses a single quadrant for characterization before integration into the full array. The initial test result shows a $&gt;$95% yield, indicating a good performance of our TIM detector packaging design.</description>

      <title>Image deconvolution and PSF reconstruction with STARRED: a wavelet-based two-channel method optimized for light-curve extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present STARRED, a Point Spread Function (PSF) reconstruction, two-channel deconvolution, and light curve extraction method designed for high-precision photometric measurements in imaging time series. An improved resolution of the data is targeted rather than an infinite one, thereby minimizing deconvolution artifacts. In addition, STARRED performs a joint deconvolution of all available data, accounting for epoch-to-epoch variations of the PSF and decomposing the resulting deconvolved image into a point source and an extended source channel. The output is a deep sharp frame combining all data, and the photometry of all point sources in the field of view as a function of time. Of note, STARRED also provides exquisite PSF models for each data frame. We showcase three applications of STARRED in the context of the imminent LSST survey and of JWST imaging: i) the extraction of supernovae light curves and the scene representation of their host galaxy, ii) the extraction of lensed quasar light curves for time-delay cosmography, and iii) the measurement of the spectral energy distribution of globular clusters in the "Sparkler", a galaxy at redshift z=1.378 strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327. STARRED is implemented in JAX, leveraging automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration. This enables rapid processing of large time-domain datasets, positioning the method as a powerful tool for extracting light curves from the multitude of lensed or unlensed variable and transient objects in the Rubin-LSST data, even when blended with intervening objects.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional inference of radio interferometer beam patterns I: Parametric model of the HERA beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modelling of the primary beam is an important but difficult task in radio astronomy. For high dynamic range problems such as 21cm intensity mapping, small modelling errors in the sidelobes and spectral structure of the beams can translate into significant systematic errors. Realistic beams exhibit complex spatial and spectral structure, presenting a major challenge for beam measurement and calibration methods. In this paper series, we present a Bayesian framework to infer per-element beam patterns from the interferometric visibilities for large arrays with complex beam structure, assuming a particular (but potentially uncertain) sky model and calibration solution. In this first paper, we develop a compact basis for the beam so that the Bayesian computation is tractable with high-dimensional sampling methods. We use the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) as an example, verifying that the basis is capable of describing its single-element E-field beam (i.e. without considering array effects like mutual coupling) with a relatively small number of coefficients. We find that 32 coefficients per feed, incident polarization, and frequency, are sufficient to give percent-level and $\sim$10\% errors in the mainlobe and sidelobes respectively for the current HERA Vivaldi feeds, improving to $\sim 0.1\%$ and $\sim 1\%$ for 128 coefficients.</description>

Abstract: Time-domain astrophysics continues to grow rapidly, with the inception of new surveys drastically increasing data volumes. Democratised, distributed approaches to training sets for machine learning classifiers are crucial to make the most of this torrent of discovery -- with citizen science approaches proving effective at meeting these requirements. In this paper, we describe the creation of and the initial results from the $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ citizen science project, built to find transient phenomena from the GOTO telescopes in near real-time. $\textit{Kilonova Seekers}$ launched in July 2023 and received over 600,000 classifications from approximately 2,000 volunteers over the course of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a observing run. During this time, the project has yielded 20 discoveries, generated a `gold-standard' training set of 17,682 detections for augmenting deep-learned classifiers, and measured the performance and biases of Zooniverse volunteers on real-bogus classification. This project will continue throughout the lifetime of GOTO, pushing candidates at ever-greater cadence, and directly facilitate the next-generation classification algorithms currently in development.</description>

      <title>Using A One-Class SVM To Optimize Transit Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As machine learning algorithms become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations and researchers are using these technologies to automate the process of exoplanet detection. These mainly utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect periodic dips in lightcurve data. While having approximately 5% lower accuracy than CNNs, the results of this study show that One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be fitted to data up to 84 times faster than simple CNNs and make predictions over 3 times faster on the same datasets using the same hardware. In addition, One-Class SVMs can be run smoothly on unspecialized hardware, removing the need for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) usage. In cases where time and processing power are valuable resources, One-Class SVMs are able to minimize time spent on transit detection tasks while maximizing performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: A comprehensive picture of the galaxy population from COSMOS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present pop-cosmos: a comprehensive model characterizing the galaxy population, calibrated to $140,938$ ($r&lt;25$ selected) galaxies from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) with photometry in $26$ bands from the ultra-violet to the infra-red. We construct a detailed forward model for the COSMOS data, comprising: a population model describing the joint distribution of galaxy characteristics and its evolution (parameterized by a flexible score-based diffusion model); a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis (SPS) model connecting galaxies' instrinsic properties to their photometry; and a data-model for the observation, calibration and selection processes. By minimizing the optimal transport distance between synthetic and real data we are able to jointly fit the population- and data-models, leading to robustly calibrated population-level inferences that account for parameter degeneracies, photometric noise and calibration, and selection. We present a number of key predictions from our model of interest for cosmology and galaxy evolution, including the mass function and redshift distribution; the mass-metallicity-redshift and fundamental metallicity relations; the star-forming sequence; the relation between dust attenuation and stellar mass, star formation rate and attenuation-law index; and the relation between gas-ionization and star formation. Our model encodes a comprehensive picture of galaxy evolution that faithfully predicts galaxy colors across a broad redshift ($z&lt;4$) and wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Response for MeV Gamma Rays Observed with Balloon-Borne Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The atmospheric response for MeV gamma rays (~ 0.1 - 10 MeV) can be characterized in terms of two observed components. The first component is due to photons that reach the detector without scattering. The second component is due to photons that reach the detector after scattering one or more times. While the former can be determined in a straightforward manner, the latter is much more complex to quantify, as it requires tracking the transport of all source photons that are incident on Earth's atmosphere. The scattered component can cause a significant energy-dependent distortion in the measured spectrum, which is important to account for when making balloon-borne observations. In this work we simulate the full response for gamma-ray transport in the atmosphere. We find that the scattered component becomes increasingly more significant towards lower energies, and at 0.1 MeV it may increase the measured flux by as much as a factor of ~2-4, depending on the photon index and off-axis angle of the source. This is particularly important for diffuse sources, whereas the effect from scattering can be significantly reduced for point sources observed with an imaging telescope.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent and energy-integrated two-moment general-relativistic neutrino transport simulations of hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two-moment based \emph{energy-dependent} and 3 variants of \emph{energy-integrated} neutrino transport general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of hypermassive neutron star. To study the impacts due to the choice of the neutrino transport schemes, we perform simulations with the same setups and input neutrino microphysics. We show that the main differences between energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino transport are found in the disk and ejecta properties, as well as in the neutrino signals. The properties of the disk surrounding the neutron star and the ejecta in energy-dependent transport are very different from the ones obtained using energy-integrated schemes. Specifically, in the energy-dependent case, the disk is more neutron-rich at early times, and becomes geometrically thicker at later times. In addition, the ejecta is more massive, and on average more neutron-rich in the energy-dependent simulations. Moreover, the average neutrino energies and luminosities are about 30\% higher. Energy-dependent neutrino transport is necessary if one wants to better model the neutrino signals and matter outflows from neutron star merger remnants via numerical simulations.</description>
