      <title>Two-dimensional Synchrotron Beam Shape Characterization using Interferometric Closure Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation interferometry (SRI) is widely used in particle accelerators to monitor the transverse beam profile, and thus the critical beam emittance parameter. We introduce a novel technique to SRI using closure amplitudes, inspired by radio interferometry, to determine the two-dimensional profile of the synchrotron beam. Previous techniques have required multiple interferograms or accurate estimates of the non-uniform aperture illuminations. In contrast, our method using closure amplitudes avoids the need to estimate the aperture illuminations while determining the two-dimensional beam shape from a single interferogram. The invariance of closure amplitudes to even time-varying aperture illuminations makes it suitable to longer averaging intervals, with potential to reducing data rates and computational overheads. Using data from the ALBA synchrotron light source and having validated the results against existing methods, this paper represents one of the first real-world applications of interferometric closure amplitudes to directly determine the light source shape.</description>

      <title>Surface and sub-surface modifications of copper electrodes exposed to high-field conditioning at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to investigate the dependence of conditioning and field-holding on temperature, three pairs of copper electrodes underwent high voltage conditioning with direct current (DC) pulses while kept at a single temperature, unique for each set (300~K, 30~K and 10~K), until saturation field for each set was found. The sets conditioned at cold showed a significant increase in the field holding capability, reaching fields up to 147 MV/m after tens of millions of pulses and very few breakdowns (BDs). We interpret this as an indication of the conditioning effect being due to high field pulsing rather than exposure to BDs. The effect of the warm and cold conditioning was investigated with high-resolution microscopy, characterizing the BD spots on the anode and cathode according to their morphology and with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyzing the changes in the sub-surface regions. Atypical BD spot features were found on the cryogenically conditioned cathode surfaces, with very shallow craters of a star-like shape. The number of atypical spots increased with decreased temperatures, reaching 26 and 53 percent of the total number of spots at 30~K and 10~K, respectively. A hypothesis explaining the formation of these features is also presented. The very different morphology of the anode and cathode BD spots is presented in detail that suggesting an unknown shielding mechanism that prevents the center of the anode spot from melting. These results provide important experimental input for the development of quantitative theories and models for BD initiation and inter-electrode plasma formation.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the mean excitation energy of liquid argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean excitation energy (I-value) of liquid argon is a critical input for energy estimation in neutrino oscillation experiments. It is measured to be $(205\pm4)$\,eV using the range of 402.2\,MeV protons from the Fermilab Linac. This compares to the author's recent evaluation of $(197\pm 7)$\,eV based on a combination of an oscillator strength distribution analysis, gaseous argon range measurements, sparse stopping power data on solid argon, and an extrapolation of data on the effect of phase from other substances. Using all sources of information, we recommend a value of $(203.0\pm3.2)$\,eV for liquid argon, which is significantly higher than 188\,eV, from ICRU-37's gaseous argon evaluation, commonly used in Monte Carlo codes such as \textsc{Geant4}.</description>
