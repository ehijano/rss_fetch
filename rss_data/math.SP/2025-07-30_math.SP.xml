      <title>Green's function estimates for long-range quasi-periodic operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative Green's function estimates for a class of quasi-periodic (QP) operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with certain slowly decaying long-range hopping and analytic cosine type potentials. As applications, we prove the arithmetic spectral localization, and obtain upper bounds on quantum dynamics for all phase parameters. To deal with quantum dynamics estimates, we develop an approach employing separation property (rather than the sublinear bound) of resonant blocks in the regime of Green's function estimates.</description>

      <title>Model theory of Hilbert spaces expanded by normal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study expansions of Hilbert spaces with a bounded normal operator $T$. We axiomatize this theory in a natural language and identify all of its completions. We prove the definability of the adjoint $T^*$ and prove quantifier elimination for every completion after adding $T^*$ to the language. We identify types with measures on the spectrum of the operator and show that the logic topology on the type space corresponds to the weak*-topology on the space of measures. We also give a precise formula for the metric on the space of $1$-types. We prove all completions are stable and characterize the stability spectrum of the theory in terms of the spectrum of the operator. We also show all completions, regardless of their spectrum, are $\omega$-stable up to perturbations.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Convolution: Infinitesimal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-free additive and multiplicative convolutions are operations on the set of polynomials with real roots, introduced independently by Szeg\"{o} and Walsh in the 1920s. These operations have regained some interest, in the last decade, after being rediscovered by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava as the expected characteristic polynomial of randomly rotated matrices. They converge, as the degree $d$ of the polynomials increases, to the additive and multiplicative convolution of measures from free probability of Voiculescu. In this paper, we investigate the fluctuations of order $1/d$ -- also known as infinitesimal distributions -- related to these two operations and their limiting behavior, providing a detailed description of their convergence. Our approach relies on understanding the infinitesimal moment-cumulant formulas and the corresponding functional relations. We also establish several applications and examples, including instances related to the infinitesimal free convolution of Belinschi and Shlyakhtenko, as well as the computation of infinitesimal distributions after differentiation of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Geometric effects of hyperbolic cohomology classes on K\"ahler manifolds (with an appendix by Beno\^it Claudon)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifold, as a"topological" generalization of K\"ahler [Gro91] and weakly K\"ahler [BDET24] hyperbolic manifolds. Analogously to [BCDT24], we show the birational invariance of this property and then that K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds are not uniruled nor bimeromorphic to compact K\"ahler manifolds with trivial first real Chern class. Then, we prove spectral gap theorems for positive holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles on K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds, obtaining in particular effective non vanishing results \`a la Kawamata for adjoint line bundles. We finally explore the effects of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolicity on Ricci and scalar curvature of K\"ahler metrics. In the appendix, it is given an explicit description of degree~$2$ hyperbolic classes for finitely presented groups, and an algebro-geometric consequence for K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic surfaces: they are necessarily of general type.</description>
