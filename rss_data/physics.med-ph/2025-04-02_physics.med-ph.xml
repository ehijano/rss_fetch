      <title>The study of non-complete-ring positron emission tomography (PET) detection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital molecular imaging tool widely used in medical diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Traditional PET systems typically rely on complete detector rings to achieve full angular coverage for uniform and statistically robust sampling of coincidence events. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged in various scenarios due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. In such cases, conventional reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation due to reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. This thesis proposes a coarse-to-fine reconstruction framework for incomplete-ring PET scanners. The framework first employs an Attention U-Net model to recover complete sinograms from incomplete ones, then uses the OSEM algorithm for preliminary reconstruction, and finally applies a two-stage architecture comprising a Coarse Prediction Module (CPM) and an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) for fine reconstruction. Our approach utilizes neighboring axial slices and spectral transform features as auxiliary guidance at the input level to ensure spatial and frequency domain consistency, and integrates a contrastive diffusion strategy at the output level to improve correspondence between low-quality PET inputs and refined PET outputs. Experimental results on public and in-house brain PET datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in metrics such as PSNR (35.6421 dB) and SSIM (0.9588), successfully preserving key anatomical structures and tracer distribution features, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-OCT simulation framework based on mathematical models of intratissue dynamics, image formation, and measurement noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) enables label-free functional imaging by capturing temporal OCT signal variations caused by intracellular and intratissue motions. However, the relationship between DOCT signals and the sample motion behind them remains unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive DOCT simulation framework that incorporates mathematical models of intracellular/intratissue motions, two OCT signal generator types that generate OCT signal time sequences from the moving scatterer models, and representative DOCT algorithms. The theory and algorithms of the framework are described in detail, and the utility of this framework is demonstrated through numerical studies. This framework is available as open source and will enhance the understanding and utility of DOCT.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>
