      <title>Formulating the Weak Gravity Conjecture in AdS Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture that applies to AdS spacetime. We find that the condition on the charge-to-mass ratio of a charged particle in AdS$_D$ spacetime is corrected compared to the one in Minkowski spacetime by contributions that depends on the AdS scale and the horizon radius of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole charged under the same gauge theory. It is maximized when we consider the largest possible extremal black hole in AdS. We motivate our proposal from the viewpoint of extremal black hole decay and show that the bound on the particle spectrum is given by the critical charge-to-mass ratio beyond which the Schwinger effect can take place. This quantum effect shares the same condition as requiring a particle to satisfy a repulsive force condition at the black hole horizon, so that the extremal black hole can decay without reabsorbing the particle. We discuss the relation of our proposed weak gravity bound with the near-horizon Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. We also comment on the generalization in the case of multiple U(1) gauge theories, providing evidence for a convex hull condition in AdS background.</description>

      <title>A Reduction Algorithm for Cosmological Correlators: Cuts, Contractions, and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators are fundamental observables in an expanding universe and are highly non-trivial functions even at tree-level. In this work, we uncover novel structures in the space of such tree-level correlators that enable us to develop a new recursive algorithm for their explicit computation. We begin by formulating cosmological correlators as solutions to GKZ systems and develop a general strategy to construct additional differential operators, called reduction operators, when a GKZ system is reducible. Applying this framework, we determine all relevant reduction operators, and show that they can be used to build up the space of functions needed to represent the correlators. Beyond relating different integrals, these operators also yield a large number of algebraic relations, including cut and contraction relations between diagrams. This implies a significant reduction in the number of functions needed to represent each tree-level cosmological correlator. We present first steps to quantify the complexity of our reduction algorithm by using the Pfaffian framework. While we focus on tree-level cosmological correlators, our approach provides a blueprint for other perturbative settings.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant effective actions for dressed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new fundamental form of the path integral for theories with local symmetry is introduced. It is utilised to construct effective actions that generate correlation functions of dressed fields in Yang-Mills theories and quantum gravity. The construction entails a novel BRST symmetric gauge fixing which imposes that the on-shell correlation functions are those of gauge invariant fields. We demonstrate that the effective actions are gauge and diffeomorphism invariant respectively, with appropriate transformations for the Faddeev-Popov ghosts and Nakanishi-Lautrup fields. As a consistency check, the on-shell one-loop effective actions are shown to take the expected gauge independent form. The effective action which satisfies Zinn-Justin's master equation is also gauge invariant with the anti-fields transforming accordingly. We argue that the renormalisation group is defined modulo BRST exact terms.</description>

      <title>Riccati-type pseudo-potential approach to quasi-integrability of deformed soliton theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review paper explores the Riccati-type pseudo-potential formulation applied to the quasi-integrable sine-Gordon, KdV, and NLS models. The proposed framework provides a unified methodology for analyzing quasi-integrability properties across various integrable systems, including deformations of the sine-Gordon, Bullough-Dodd, Toda, KdV, pKdV, NLS and SUSY sine-Gordon models. Key findings include the emergence of infinite towers of anomalous conservation laws within the Riccati-type approach and the identification of exact non-local conservation laws in the linear formulations of deformed models. As modified integrable models play a crucial role in diverse fields of non-linear physics-such as Bose-Einstein condensation, superconductivity, gravity models, optics, and soliton turbulence-these results may have far-reaching applications.</description>

      <title>Linearized Coxeter Higher-Spin Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of higher-spin gauge theories on $AdS_4$ associated with various Coxeter groups $\mathcal{C}$ is analyzed at the linear order. For a general $\mathcal{C}$, a solution corresponding to the $AdS_4$ space and the form of the free unfolded equations are established. A disentanglement criterion has been formulated for Coxeter HS modules. The shifted homotopy technique is uplifted to the general Coxeter HS models. In case of the Coxeter group $B_2$ classification of unitary HS modules and a consistent truncation to them are determined, the dynamical content is discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>The Nilpotency Index for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-developed classification program for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ super conformal field theories (SCFTs) leverages Seiberg-Witten geometry on the Coulomb branch of vacua; theories are arranged by increasing $\mathfrak{rank}$, the complex dimension of their Coulomb branch. An alternative organizational scheme focusses on the associated vertex operator algebra (VOA), which is more closely related to the Higgs branch. From the VOA perspective, a natural way to arrange theories is by their ``index of nilpotency'', the smallest integer $\mathfrak{n}$ such that $T^\mathfrak{n} = 0$ in the $C_2$ algebra, where $T$ is the VOA stress tensor. It follows from the Higgs branch reconstruction conjecture that $\mathfrak{n} &lt; \infty$ for any 4d ${\cal N}=2$ SCFT. Extrapolating from several examples, we conjecture that $\mathfrak{n}$ is an RG monotone, $\mathfrak{n}_{\rm IR} \leq \mathfrak{n}_{\rm UV}$. What's more, we find in all cases that $\mathfrak{rank} \leq \mathfrak{n}-1$. Theory ordering by $\mathfrak{n}$ appears thus more refined than ordering by $\mathfrak{rank}$. For example, in the list of $\mathfrak{rank}=1$ theories, the Kodaira SCFTs and $SU(2)$ ${\cal N}=4$ SYM have $\mathfrak{n} =2$, while all others have $\mathfrak{n} &gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on nonperturbative perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the linearized perturbations of near-horizon extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in $d$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and seven-dimensional third-order Lovelock gravity. We find the solutions for the gravitational perturbations as a function of the higher-derivative coupling coefficients, which we treat nonperturbatively. Consequently, we observe a breakdown in perturbation theory for large harmonics for the six-derivative corrections.</description>

      <title>Transport and response coefficients in second-order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics with quantum corrections: probing the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A functional measure encompasses quantum corrections and is explored in the fluid/gravity correspondence. Corrections to response and transport coefficients in the second-order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics are proposed, including the ones to the pressure, the relaxation time, and the shear relaxation. Their dependence on the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) temperature sets a temperature dependence on the running parameter encoding the one-loop quantum gravity correction, driven by a functional measure. The experimental range of the bulk viscosity-to-entropy density ratio of the QGP corroborates the existence of the functional measure.</description>

      <title>B-brane transport in nonabelian GLSMs for $K_{Gr(2,N)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of B-branes in a class of nonabelian GLSMs realizing the canonical line bundle $K_{Gr(2,N)}$ in their geometric phase. By analysing the hemisphere partition function, i.e. B-brane central charge, we propose a grade restriction rule and the corresponding window categories for a specific class of paths between phases. We find very striking differences between the cases of N even and N odd. In particular, for the case of N even, we suggest that more than one window category can be possible, for a fixed path. A detailed computation of the open Witten index and some monodromies provides evidence for our proposal for window categories. In addition, we make some remarks about B-branes on the the strongly coupled phase, for the case $N=4$, based on our window proposal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore various field theory aspects of integrable $ \eta $-deformed geometry in type IIB supergravity by employing several holographic probes. These include the computation of holographic timelike entanglement entropy and estimation of various other field theory observables for example, the flow central charge and the quantum complexity. We also discuss the associated brane set up and compute Page charges. We further use them to calculate the coupling constant in the dual QFTs considering both small and large deformation limits.</description>

      <title>Applying Constraints from Outside of the System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the representation of the external constraints imposed on the system within the generating functional. These constraints are applied to both the degrees of freedom and their time derivatives, and the generating functional is expressed as a functional integral over the degrees of freedom. To achieve this, we employ the path integral method for handling second-class constraints, which we have briefly reviewed. We use the obtained result to derive the generating functional for matter vector fields constrained to the spin-one state. However, achieving the desired result for a system with a singular action requires certain sufficient conditions that we will obtain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the general analytic solution space for relativistic $(1+1)$-dimensional hydrodynamics for a perfect fluid flowing along the longitudinal direction. We work out the explicit one-parameter family of interpolating flows between boost-invariant and boost-non-invariant regimes, where a direct and simple dialing of the parameter at the level of solutions is possible. We also discuss the construction of generalised rapidity distribution of entropy for such interpolating flows at the level of potentials.</description>

      <title>Janus and RG-flow interfaces from 5D N=4 gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study five-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)$ gauge group. The gauged supergravity admits two supersymmetric $AdS_5$ vacua. One of the vacua, at the origin of the scalar manifold $\mathbb{R}^+\times SO(5,3)/SO(5)\times SO(3)$, preserves $N=4$ supersymmetry and the full $SO(2)_D\times SO(3)$ gauge symmetry. The second $AdS_5$ vacuum is $N=2$ supersymmetric and invariant under $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ which is a diagonal subgroup of $SO(2)_D$ and $SO(2)\subset SO(3)$. By considering a truncation to $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ invariant scalars, we find a class of Janus solutions interpolating among these vacua. These solutions should be holographically dual to conformal interfaces within the dual $N=1$ and $N=2$ SCFTs in four dimensions. In addition, we also find examples of solutions describing RG-flow interfaces between $N=1$ and $N=2$ SCFTs on each side of the interfaces. All of the solutions could possibly be uplifted to eleven dimensions by a consistent truncation of M-theory on $M_3\times S^2\times S^1$ with a 3-manifold $M_3$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Casimir effect of a Lorentz-violating scalar with higher order derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I study the Casimir effect caused by a charged and massive scalar field that breaks Lorentz invariance in a CPT-even, aether-like manner. The breaking of Lorentz invariance is implemented by a constant space-like vector directly coupled to higher order derivatives of the field. I take this vector to be space-like to avoid non-causality problems that could arise with a time-like vector. I examine the two scenarios of the scalar field satisfying either Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions on a pair of plane parallel plates. I use the zeta function technique to investigate the effect of a constant magnetic field, perpendicular to the plates, on the Casimir energy and pressure. I examine two different directions of the unit vector: parallel and perpendicular to the plates. I fully examine both scenarios for both types of boundary conditions and, in both cases and for both types of boundary conditions, I obtain simple analytic expressions of the Casimir energy and pressure in the three asymptotic limits of strong magnetic field, large mass, and small plate distance.</description>

      <title>Large $\theta$ angle in two-dimensional large $N$ $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In confining large $N$ theories with a $\theta$ angle such as four-dimensional $\rm{SU}(N)$ pure Yang-Mills theory, there are multiple metastable vacua and it makes sense to consider the parameter region of ``large $\theta$ of order $N$'' despite the fact that $\theta$ is a $2\pi$-periodic parameter. We investigate this parameter region in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the partition function on $T^2$. When $\theta/N$ is of order $ \mathcal{O}(0.1) $ or less, we get perfectly sensible results for the vacuum energies and decay rates of metastable vacua. However, when $\theta/N$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(1) $, we encounter a problem about saddle points that would give larger contributions to the partition function than the true vacuum.

      <title>Integrable deformed H$_{_{4}}$ WZW models and their non-Abelian duals as solutions of generalized supergravity equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed backgrounds of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model based on the H$_{_{4}}$ Lie group can be considered as solutions of the generalized supergravity equations (GSEs). Then, using the Poisson-Lie T-duality approach in the presence of spectators, we obtain the non-Abelian duals of those models. It is shown that all dual models (except for one model) are integrable and satisfy the GSEs.</description>

      <title>Star-products for Lie-algebraic noncommutative Minkowski space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson structures of the Poincar\'e group can be linked to deformations of the Minkowski space-time, classified some time ago. We construct the star-products and involutions characterizing the $*$-algebras of various quantum Minkowski space-times with non-centrally extended coordinates Lie algebras. We show that the usual Lebesgue integral defines either a trace or a KMS weight ("twisted trace") depending whether the Lie group of the coordinates' Lie algebra is unimodular or not. We determine the Hopf algebras modeling the deformed relativistic symmetries, which appear to be either a deformation of the usual (Hopf) Poincar\'e algebra or a deformation of an enlarged algebra. The results are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Some Thermal Properties of Ideal Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the thermal properties of non-relativistic many-body systems at finite temperature and chemical potential. We compute the one-point function of various operators constructed out of the basic fields in ideal bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. The one-point function is non-zero only for operators with zero particle numbers. We investigate these operators in $\mathbb R^d$ and $\mathbb R^d_{+}$, i.e. a flat space with a planar boundary. Furthermore, we compute the Green's function and using the operator product expansion, we express it in terms of the thermal one-point function of the higher spin currents. On $\mathbb R^d_{+}$, the operator product expansion allows to express the bulk-bulk Green's function in terms of the thermal Green's function of the boundary operators.
  We also study the ideal system by placing it on curved spatial surfaces, specifically spherical surfaces. We compute the partition function and Green's function on spheres, squashed-sphere and hemispheres. Finally, we compute the large radius corrections to the partition function and Green's function by expanding in the large radius limit.</description>

      <title>$\kappa$-symmetric M5 brane web for defects in $AdS_7 / CFT_6$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we will continue our analysis of some general probe M5 brane solutions from our previous work in $AdS_7 \times S^4$ spacetime (appeared in arxiv:2109.08551). These are codimension-2 in $AdS_7$ and preserve at least 2 supercharges when the worldvolume 3-form flux field strength is zero. We will turn on the field strength and find that the embedding conditions are modified, excluding certain branes contained in the previous result. The new main result here is very general, so we pick simpler embedding conditions that describe highly symmetric examples that preserve half of the supersymmetry of the 11 dimensions. When the flux field is zero, worldvolumes have $AdS_5 \times S^1$ topology. We turn the flux field value non-zero in these examples and analyze how the shape of the worldvolume deforms as supersymmetry is broken by some additional fractions.</description>

      <title>Exact Three-Point Functions in $\mathcal{N}=2$ Superconformal Field Theories: Integrability vs. Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an integrability approach for planar three-point functions at finite coupling in $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories obtained by $\mathbb{Z}_K$ orbifolds of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). Generalizing the hexagon formalism for $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, we reproduce the structure constants of Coulomb branch operators, previously obtained by supersymmetric localization as exact functions of the 't Hooft coupling. Our analysis explains the common physical origin of Fredholm kernels in integrability and localization, and hints at structures after the resummation in the hexagon formalism.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD Running Coupling for Heavy Quarks in Strong Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous work [arXiv:2407.11924], which investigated the influence of a magnetic field on the running coupling constant in a bottom-up holographic light-quark model, to the case of a heavy-quark model. To achieve this, we employ a magnetized Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton background that captures the essential features of heavy quark dynamics. Similar to the light-quark model, the running coupling $\alpha$ for heavy quarks decreases in the presence of a strong external magnetic field at fixed temperature and chemical potential. The key distinction between the light and heavy quark models lies in the locations of their respective phase transitions. However, near the 1st order phase transitions, the behavior of $\alpha$ is analogous for both cases: $\alpha$ exhibits jumps that depend on temperature, chemical potential, and magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Equation of the Large U(1) Chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we first heuristically constitute the charges for the chiral transformation associated with the large U(1) gauge symmetry. We name those as the large chiral charges, and the chiral transformation those generate as the large chiral transformations. Then, showing that those can be obtained based on Noether's theorem, we once obtain the anomaly equation associated with those large chiral transformations. Then, for the one-loop diagrams of the fermionic field coupling to the multiple classical gauge fields (those constitute the effective action of the model in this study with regard to the gauge field), we perform an axailization. Then, defining the BRS transformations for the large U(1) gauge symmetry (we name those as the large BRS transformation), we perform those large BRS transformations to those axialized one-loop diagrams. Then, evaluating those, we show that the anomaly equations mentioned above can be derived. It is also shown that those anomaly equations can be derived in Fujikawa method. The result in this study would be important as a development of the large U(1) gauge symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07583v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop methods for systematic construction of superintegrable polynomials in matrix/eigenvalue models. Our consideration is based on a tight connection of superintegrable property of Gaussian Hermitian model and $W_{1 + \infty}$ algebra in Fock representation. Motivated by this example, we propose a set of assumptions that may allow one to recover superintegrable polynomials. The main two assumptions are box adding/removing rule (Pierri rule) and existence of Hamiltonian for superintegrable polynomials. We detail our method in case of the Gaussian Hermitian model, and then apply it to the cubic Kontsevich model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triad refers to embedding of two systems of polynomials, symmetric ones and those of the Baker-Akhiezer type into a power series of the Noumi-Shiraishi type. It provides an alternative definition of Macdonald theory and its extensions. The basic triad is associated with the vector representation of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. We discuss lifting this triad to two elliptic generalizations and further to the bi-elliptic triad. At the algebraic level, it corresponds to elliptic and bi-elliptic DIM algebras. This completes the list of polynomials associated with Seiberg-Witten theory with adjoint matter in various dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to simulate realistic inhomogeneities during cosmological inflation with high precision using numerical relativity. Stochastic initial conditions are set in line with the Bunch-Davies vaccuum and satisfy the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints of General Relativity to leading order in perturbation theory. The subsequent fully non-linear dynamical evolution is formulated within a family of geodesic gauges but can in principle be adapted to any choice of coordinates. We present 3 examples of inflationary dynamics: a simple quadratic potential, a potential with an inflection point and a strong resonance model. When perturbations are small, we recover standard predictions of cosmological perturbation theory, and we quantify strongly non-linear inhomogeneities when non-perturbative configurations emerge, such as in the strong resonance model. Our results pave the way towards the first realistic non-perturbative, and fully non-linear Numerical Relativity simulations of the early inflationary universe.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of quantum field theory, we analyze the neutrino oscillations in the presence of a torsion background. We consider the Einstein Cartan theory and we study the cases of constant torsion and of linearly time-dependent torsion. We derive new neutrino oscillation formulae which depend on the spin orientation and the CP asymmetry formula. Experiment such as PTOLEMY which analyzes the cosmological background of neutrino, can provide insights into the effect shown here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-modal stability of black hole spacetimes under linear perturbations. We show that large-amplitude growth can occur at finite time, despite asymptotic decay of linear perturbations. In the example presented, the physical mechanism is a transient form of superradiance, and is qualitatively similar to the transition to turbulence in Navier-Stokes shear flows. As part of the construction we provide a theorem for the positivity of QNM energies, and introduce a truncated-Hamiltonian approach to black hole pseudospectra which does not suffer from convergence issues.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification From Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty from machine learning analyses is critical to their use in the physical sciences. In this work we focus on uncertainty inherited from the initialization distribution of neural networks. We compute the mean $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and variance $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}^2$ of the test loss $\mathcal{L}$ for an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with neural tangent kernel (NTK) initialization in the infinite-width limit, and compare empirically to the results from finite-width networks for three example tasks: MNIST classification, CIFAR classification and calorimeter energy regression. We observe scaling laws as a function of training set size $N_\mathcal{D}$ for both $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}$, but find that the coefficient of variation $\epsilon_{\mathcal{L}} \equiv \sigma_{\mathcal{L}}/\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ becomes independent of $N_\mathcal{D}$ at both infinite and finite width for sufficiently large $N_\mathcal{D}$. This implies that the coefficient of variation of a finite-width network may be approximated by its infinite-width value, and may in principle be calculable using finite-width perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electrodynamics from Quantum Cellular Automata, and the Tension Between Symmetry, Locality and Positive Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that free QED is equivalent to the continuous-space-and-time limit of Fermi and Bose lattice quantum cellular automata theories derived from quantum random walks satisfying simple symmetry and unitarity conditions. In doing so we define the Fermi and Bose theories in a unified manner using the usual fermion internal space but a boson internal space that is six-dimensional. We show that the reduction to a two-dimensional boson internal space (two helicity states arising from spin-1 plus the photon transversality condition) comes from restricting the quantum cellular automaton theory to positive energies. We briefly examine common symmetries of quantum cellular automata, and how time-reversal symmetry demands the existence of negative-energy solutions. These solutions produce a tension in coupling the Fermi and Bose theories, in which the strong locality of quantum cellular automata seems to require a nonzero amplitude to produce negative-energy states, leading to an unphysical cascade of negative-energy particles. However, we show in a 1D model that by extending interactions over a larger (but finite) range it is possible to exponentially suppress the production of negative-energy particles to the point where they can be neglected.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a regular function $\phi$ on a smooth stack, and a $(-1)$-shifted Lagrangian $M$ on the derived critical locus of $\phi$, under fairly general hypotheses, we construct a pullback map from the Grothendieck group of coherent matrix factorizations of $\phi$ to that of coherent sheaves on $M$. This map satisfies a functoriality property with respect to the composition of Lagrangian correspondences, as well as the usual bivariance and base-change properties.
  We provide three applications of the construction, one in the definition of quantum $K$-theory of critical loci (Landau-Ginzburg models), paving the way to generalize works of Okounkov school from Nakajima quiver varieties to quivers with potentials, one in establishing a degeneration formula for $K$-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas theory of local Calabi-Yau 4-folds, the other in confirming a $K$-theoretic version of Joyce-Safronov conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.</description>

Crucial to our construction is a new parametrization of the dilaton and axion fields based on the analyticity argument. The general solution in the ungauged case is asymptotically locally flat and contains two more parameters compared to EMDA black holes previously obtained using Harrison transformations. In the gauged case, the general solution is asymptotically AdS and includes flat and hyperbolic topological solutions, as well as generalization of the Kerr-Sen-AdS metric with three additional parameters. Our approach can be applied to more general four-dimensional ungauged and gauged supergravities.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Classical Approximation of Electromagnetic Radiation by Fermions embedded in Rigidly Rotating Medium in Strong Magnetic Field</title>

Abstract: We develop the quasi-classical (WKB) approximation of the synchrotron radiation by a fermion embedded into uniformly rotating system in external magnetic field. We show that it gives an accurate approximation of the exact expression that we recently obtained at a tiny fraction of the numerical cost. Our results can be used to compute the electromagnetic radiation of the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Lindblad many-body scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06665v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</description>

      <title>On the Representation Categories of Weak Hopf Algebras Arising from Levin-Wen Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their study of Levin-Wen models [Commun. Math. Phys. 313 (2012) 351-373], Kitaev and Kong proposed a weak Hopf algebra associated with a unitary fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ and a unitary left $\mathcal{C}$-module $\mathcal{M}$, and sketched a proof that its representation category is monoidally equivalent to the unitary $\mathcal{C}$-module functor category $\mathrm{Fun}^{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{M})^\mathrm{rev}$. We give an independent proof of this result without the unitarity conditions. In particular, viewing $\mathcal{C}$ as a left $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{rev}}$-module, we obtain a quasi-triangular weak Hopf algebra whose representation category is braided equivalent to the Drinfeld center $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. In the appendix, we also compare this quasi-triangular weak Hopf algebra with the tube algebra $\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ when $\mathcal{C}$ is pivotal. These two algebras are Morita equivalent by the well-known equivalence $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}})\cong\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. However, we show that in general there is no weak Hopf algebra structure on $\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}}$ such that the above equivalence is monoidal.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Palatini Formulation of Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Palatini formulation has been successful in the development of several alternative theories of gravity. It is well understood that the Palatini and metric formulations are equivalent in minimally coupled scalar-tensor models, but nonminimal scalar-tensor models can lead to physically distinct theories depending on the underlying formulation. Once a model has been selected, the choice of formulation is a discrete one, and so promoting it to be continuous is expected to give rise to a wider class of actions. To this end, we propose the "quasi-Palatini" formulation, a method for interpolating between the metric and Palatini formulations for a given model that gives rise to a continuous family of models. We apply the quasi-Palatini formulation to Higgs inflation, induced gravity inflation, and Starobinsky inflation, and demonstrate how this leads to a deformation of the potential, studying its impact on observables. We also discuss how the interpolation between different actions can be extended to scalar-torsion and scalar-nonmetricity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hidden momentum is a puzzling phenomenon associated with magnetic dipoles and other extended relativistic systems. We point out that the origin of hidden momentum lies in the effective change of individual particle masses of a composite body, during which the total momentum of the system is not equal to the momentum of the center of mass. Defining the hidden momentum as the difference between the total momentum and the center-of-mass momentum, we explain in detail how hidden momentum arises in certain simple non-relativistic systems, in typical relativistic systems due to velocity-dependent ``relativistic mass'', and in magnetic dipoles as a special case of relativistic systems.</description>

      <title>Spin of fractional quantum Hall neutral modes and "missing states" on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A low-energy neutral quasiparticle in a fractional quantum Hall system appears in the latter's energy spectrum on a sphere as a series of many-body excited states labeled by the angular momentum $L$ and whose energy is a smooth function of $L$ in the limit of large sphere radius. We argue that the signature of a nonvanishing spin (intrinsic angular momentum) $s$ of the quasiparticle is the absence, in this series, of states with total angular momentum less than $s$.We reinterpret the missing of certain states, observed in an exact-diagonalization calculation of the spectrum of the $\nu=7/3$ FQH state in a wide quantum well as well as in many proposed wave functions for the excited states as a consequence of the spin-2 nature of the zero-momentum magnetoroton.</description>

Abstract: We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. To derive this solution, we use the Newman-Janis algorithm as a mathematical tool that reduces a general rotating metric into a tractable form by applying simple physical requirements. Interestingly, the solution we found may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby challenging the no-hair theorem. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics (``hair") affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.</description>

      <title>The history of the Arcetri Physics Institute from the 1920s to the end of the 1960s</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The history of the Arcetri Institute of Physics at the University of Florence is analyzed from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s. Thanks to the arrival of Garbasso in 1913, not only did the Institute gain new premises on Arcetri hill, but also hosted brilliant young physicists such as Rita Brunetti, Enrico Fermi, Franco Rasetti in the '20s and Enrico Persico, Bruno Rossi, Gilberto Bernardini, Daria Bocciarelli, Lorenzo Emo Capodilista, Giuseppe Occhialini and Giulio Racah in the '30s, engaged in the emerging fields of Quantum Mechanics and Cosmic Rays. This internationally renowned Arcetri School dissolved in the late 1930s mainly for the transfer of its protagonists to chairs in other Italian or foreign universities. After the war, the legacy was taken up by some students of this school who formed research groups in the fields of nuclear physics and elementary particle physics. As far as theoretical physics is concerned, after the Fermi and Persico periods, these studies enjoyed a new expansion in the sixties thanks to the arrival of Raoul Gatto who created in Arcetri the first Italian school of theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Towards low-dimensionalization of four-dimensional QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the one-dimensional color-electric flux-tube in a hadron, we propose a possible way of low-dimensionalization of 4D QCD. As a strategy, we use gauge degrees of freedom and propose a new gauge fixing of ``dimensional reduction (DR) gauge". The DR gauge is defined so as to minimize $R_{\rm DR} \equiv \int d^4s~{\rm Tr}~[A^2_x(s)+A^2_y(s)]$, which preserves the 2D SU($N_{c}$) gauge symmetry. We investigate low-dimensionalization properties of 4D DR-gauged QCD in SU(3) lattice QCD at $\beta$ = 6.0. In the DR gauge, the amplitudes of two gluon components $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ are found to be strongly suppressed, and these components have a large effective mass of $M_{\perp} \simeq 1.7$ GeV. In the DR gauge, the static interquark potential is well reproduced only with the two components $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$, while $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ seem to be inactive. We investigate the spatial correlation of two $t$-directed gluons and find that the correlation decreases as $e^{-mr}$ with $m \simeq$ 0.64 GeV, corresponding to the correlation length $\xi \equiv 1/m \simeq$ 0.31 fm. We reduce 4D QCD in the DR gauge to 2D QCD with the coupling $g_{2D} = g/\xi$, which approximately reproduces the string tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Specifically, we examine the simplest scenario in which the scalar field lacks a kinetic term, and its kinetic contribution arises from an integration by parts of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. We consider four- and five-dimensional anisotropic spacetimes, focusing on Bianchi I and extended Bianchi I geometries. Our study reveals that the asymptotic solutions correspond to locally symmetric spacetimes where at least two scale factors exhibit analogous behavior or, alternatively, to isotropic configurations where all scale factors evolve identically. Additionally, we discuss the effects of a cosmological constant, finding that the presence of the cosmological constant does not lead to an isotropic universe.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological degrees of freedom of Proca field with non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity through the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar interactions. We show that in the homogeneous and isotropic Universe together with cosmological constant, the temporal component of the vector field acquires a background value. As a result, we show that the theory propagates an additional degree of freedom, with respect to the generalized Proca theories, whose kinetic term suggests the presence of several strong coupling regimes that depend on the value of the background solution, the combination and vanishing of coupling constants, together with a scale-dependent one. We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling. In addition, we discover a mode with scale-dependent strong coupling (vanishing kinetic term), one mode that propagates only in one single direction and two unstable modes.</description>

      <title>Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System, we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values and low mean squared error. The present work paves the way for future research into higher-order corrections and enhanced computational methods for cosmological parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole with double-null simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical collapse of Bronnikov-Ellis (BE) wormhole using the double-null formalism, where its throat is characterized by the coincidence of two curves $r_{,u} = 0$ and $r_{,v} = 0$. The emission of two ingoing pulses: normal scalar and phantom fields in the wormhole spacetime reveals two distinct instability scenarios: a normal scalar field triggers gravitational collapse into a black hole where the singularity $r=0$ hidden by the event horizon ($r_{,u}=0$ and $r_{,v}=0$); while a phantom field drives inflationary expansion of wormhole, decoupling two asymptotic regions with the cosmological horizon ($r_{,u}=0$ and $r_{,v}=0$). The process of two scenarios can be accelerated by increasing the amplitude of pulses but can be delayed by increasing the wormhole's mass. Additionally, the collisions of two identical pulses from ingoing and outgoing null directions in the massless BE wormhole fail to cure the instabilities because the two scenarios can still occur, but the formation of a black hole can be delayed for the collision of normal and phantom fields. Interestingly, the strategic tuning of emission timing for outgoing phantom field to collide with ingoing normal scalar field can temporarily stabilize the wormhole throat by restoring the coincidence of $r_{,u}$ and $r_{,v}$ again after their separation. This offers us valuable insights into extending the lifetime of a traversable wormhole.</description>

      <title>Analytic Four-Point Lightlike Form Factors and OPE of Null-Wrapped Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain for the first time the analytic two-loop four-point MHV lightlike form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar ${\cal N}=4$ SYM where the momentum $q$ carried by the operator is taken to be massless. Remarkably, we find that the two-loop result can be constrained uniquely by the infrared divergences and the collinear limits using the master-bootstrap method. Moreover, the remainder function depends only on three dual conformal invariant variables, which can be understood from a hidden dual conformal symmetry of the form factor arising in the lightlike limit of $q$. The symbol alphabet of the remainder contains only nine letters, which are closed under the action of the dihedral group $D_4$. Based on the dual description in terms of periodic Wilson lines (null-wrapped polygons), we also consider a new OPE picture for the lightlike form factors and introduce a new form factor transition that corresponds to the three-point lightlike form factor. With the form factor results up to two loops, we make some all-loop predictions using the OPE picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Form factors of self-dual gauge theory are equal to correlators of an (extended) celestial chiral algebra. This suggests that these form factors can be computed using the "bootstrap" method familiar from 2d CFTs. The method can also be applied to certain QCD amplitudes, which are built from form-factors of self-dual gauge theory.
  In this paper this bootstrap method is applied to compute two-loop all-plus QCD amplitudes, for $SU(N)$ gauge theory with certain special matter conent. A closed formula is presented for all single-trace amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Constructing polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An explicit construction is presented of homotopy-invariant iterated integrals on a Riemann surface of arbitrary genus in terms of a flat connection valued in a freely generated Lie algebra. The integration kernels consist of modular tensors, built from convolutions of the Arakelov Green function and its derivatives with holomorphic Abelian differentials, combined into a flat connection. Our construction thereby produces explicit formulas for polylogarithms as higher-genus modular tensors. This construction generalizes the elliptic polylogarithms of Brown-Levin, and prompts future investigations into the relation with the function spaces of higher-genus polylogarithms in the work of Enriquez-Zerbini.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In exploring supersymmetric theories with 8 supercharges, the Higgs branches present an intriguing window into strong coupling dynamics. Magnetic quivers serve as crucial tools for understanding these branches. Here, we introduce the decay and fission algorithm for unitary magnetic quivers. It efficiently derives complete phase diagrams (Hasse diagrams) through convex linear algebra. It allows magnetic quivers to undergo decay or fission, reflecting Higgs branch RG-flows in the theory. Importantly, the algorithm generates magnetic quivers for the RG fixed points and simplifies the understanding of transverse slice geometry with no need for a list of minimal transitions. In contrast, the algorithm hints to the existence of a new minimal transition, whose geometry and physics needs to be explored.</description>

      <title>Higgs branch RG-flows via Decay and Fission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic quivers have been an instrumental technique for advancing our understanding of Higgs branches of supersymmetric theories with 8 supercharges. In this work, we present the decay and fission algorithm for unitary magnetic quivers. It enables the derivation of the complete phase (Hasse) diagram and is characterised by the following key attributes: First and foremost, the algorithm is inherently simple; just relying on convex linear algebra. Second, any magnetic quiver can only undergo decay or fission processes; these reflect the possible Higgs branch RG-flows (Higgsings), and the quivers thereby generated are the magnetic quivers of the new RG fixed points. Third, the geometry of the decay or fission transition (i.e. the transverse slice) is simply read off. As a consequence, the algorithm does not rely on a complete list of minimal transitions, but rather outputs the transverse slice geometry automatically. As a proof of concept, its efficacy is showcased across various scenarios, encompassing SCFTs from dimensions 3 to 6, instanton moduli spaces, and little string theories.</description>

      <title>Strong-weak symmetry and quantum modularity of resurgent topological strings on local $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantizing the mirror curve to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold gives rise to quantum operators whose fermionic spectral traces produce factorially divergent formal power series in the Planck constant and its inverse. These are conjecturally captured by the Nekrasov-Shatashvili and standard topological string free energies, respectively, via the TS/ST correspondence. The resurgent structures of the first fermionic spectral trace of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ in both weak and strong coupling limits were solved exactly by the second author in [1]. Here, we argue that a full-fledged strong-weak resurgent symmetry is at play, exchanging the perturbative/non-perturbative contributions to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic blocks in the factorization of the spectral trace. This relies on a global net of relations connecting the perturbative series and the discontinuities in the dual regimes, which is built upon the analytic properties of the $L$-functions with coefficients given by the Stokes constants and the $q$-series acting as their generating functions. Then, we show that the latter are holomorphic quantum modular forms for $\Gamma_1(3)$ and are reconstructed by the median resummation of their asymptotic expansions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy and Thermal Phase Transitions from Curvature Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study holographic entanglement entropy and revisit thermodynamics and confinement in the dilaton-gravity system. Our analysis focuses on a solvable class of backgrounds that includes AdS and linear dilaton spacetimes as particular cases, with some results extended to general warped metrics. A general lesson is that the behavior of the holographic theory is tied to the bulk curvature singularities. We find that a singular background is confining if and only if i) the singularity coincides with a boundary or ii) it is the linear dilaton. In the former case, for which the singularity cuts off spacetime, we demonstrate that both entanglement entropy and thermodynamics exhibit a first order phase transition. In the linear dilaton case we find instead that both entanglement entropy and thermal phase transitions are of second order. Additionally, along the process we thoroughly derive the radion effective action at quadratic order.</description>

Abstract: We compute the particle creation of a harmonic oscillator using the classical stochastic method. This recently constructed method reproduces all the vacuum expectation values in quantum theory. We prepare the vacuum state at the initial time and evolve it over time using Langevin equations of motion. By averaging over the ensemble, we compute the energy of the state at the final time and determine the amount of particles created. We verify that the particle creation agrees with predictions from quantum theory and thus give an evidence that this method can really compute the quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new factorization pattern for tree-level Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes, where they decompose into a sum of gluings of two lower-point amplitudes by setting specific two-point non-planar Mandelstam variables within a rectangular configuration to zero. This approach manifests the hidden zeros of YM amplitudes recently identified. Furthermore, by setting specific Lorentz products involving polarization vectors to zero, the amplitudes further reduce to a sum of products of three currents. These novel factorizations provide a fresh perspective on the structure of YM amplitudes, potentially enhancing our understanding and calculation of these fundamental quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that physical scattering observables for compact spinning objects in general relativity can depend on additional degrees of freedom in the spin tensor beyond those described by the spin vector alone. The impulse, spin kick, and leading-order waveforms exhibit such a nontrivial dependence. A signal of this additional structure is the change in the magnitude of the spin vector under conservative Hamiltonian evolution, similar to our previous studies in electrodynamics. These additional degrees of freedom describe dynamical mass multipoles of compact objects and decouple for black holes. We also show that the conservative impulse, spin kick and change of the additional degrees of freedom are encoded in the eikonal phase.</description>

      <title>Weyl gauge invariant DBI action in conformal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18173v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the analogue of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions and obtain a general theory of gravity with Weyl gauge symmetry of dilatations (Weyl-DBI). This is done in the Weyl gauge covariant formulation of conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions, suitable for a gauge theory, in which this geometry is metric. The Weyl-DBI action is a special gauge theory in that it has the same gauge invariant expression with dimensionless couplings in any dimension $d$, with no need for a UV regulator (be it a DR subtraction scale, field or higher derivative operator) for which reason we argue it is Weyl-anomaly free. For $d=4$ dimensions, the leading order of a series expansion of the Weyl-DBI action recovers the gauge invariant Weyl quadratic gravity action associated to this geometry, that is Weyl anomaly-free; this is broken spontaneously and Einstein-Hilbert gravity is recovered in the broken phase, with $\Lambda&gt;0$. All the remaining terms of this series expansion are of non-perturbative nature but can, in principle, be recovered by (perturbative) quantum corrections in Weyl quadratic gravity in $d=4$ in a gauge invariant (geometric) regularisation, provided by the Weyl-DBI action. If the Weyl gauge boson is not dynamical the Weyl-DBI action recovers in the leading order the conformal gravity action. All fields and scales have geometric origin, with no added matter, scalar field compensators or UV regulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum turbulence is a far-from-equilibrium process characterized by high nonlinearity. Holographic duality provides a systematic framework for simulating the decaying $(3+1)$-dimensional quantum turbulence by numerically solving the dual Abelian-Higgs theory in a $(4+1)$-dimensional black hole background. We reveal that different types of decay behavior of the total vortex line density $L$ emerge depending on the initial vortex line density, ranging from $L\sim t^{-1.5}$ to $L\sim t^{-1}$, similar to the experimental observation of $^3$He in Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 035301 (2006), and of $^4$He in Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4831 (1999) and in Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 134501 (2017). Furthermore, by measuring the energy flux at the black hole horizon, we determine that the energy dissipation rate $dE/dt$ is proportional to the square of the total vortex line density, consistent with the vortex line decay equation proposed by W. F. Vinen and also the experimental measurement in Nature Physics 7, 473 - 476 (2011).</description>

      <title>Analytic two-Loop four-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop four-point MHV form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in planar ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). This form factor is analogous to the Higgs plus four-gluon amplitudes in the heavy-top limit of QCD when translated to the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM context. We obtain the full $D$-dimensional integrands up to two loops via unitarity-cut methods. Subsequently, we utilize IBP reduction to express the result in terms of a set of uniformly transcendental basis integrals, incorporating the two-loop non-planar five-point one-mass integrals recently given by Abreu et al. [PRL 132 (2024) 14]. We obtain the two-loop finite remainder in the functional form in terms of the pentagon functions. The symbol of our remainder confirms the bootstrap results reported by Dixon et al. [PRL 130 (2023) 11]. We perform various non-trivial checks of our results, including the triple-collinear limit, which recovers the two-loop six-gluon remainder. We also show that the form factor has a directional dual conformal symmetry at the integrand level. Our results are expected to shed further light on the study of antipodal dualities and the computation of Higgs plus four-parton amplitudes in QCD.</description>

Abstract: It is shown how spin one vector matter fields can be coupled to a Yang-Mills theory. Such matter fields are defined as belonging to a representation $R$ of this Yang-Mills gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. It is also required that these fields together with the original gauge fields be the gauge fields of an embedding total gauge algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\rm tot}$. The existence of a physically consistent Yang-Mills action for the total algebra is finally required. These conditions are rather restrictive, as shown in some examples: non-trivial solutions may or may not exist depending on the choice of the original algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and of the representation $R$. Some examples are shown, the case of the initial algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ = $\mathfrak{u}(1)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)$ being treated in more detail.</description>

      <title>On-shell Recursion Relations for Tree-level Closed String Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a general expression for on-shell recursion relations of closed string tree-level amplitudes. Starting with the string amplitudes written in the form of the Koba-Nielsen integral, we apply the BCFW shift to deform them. In contrast to open string amplitudes, where poles are explicitly determined by the integration over vertex positions, we utilize Schwinger's parametrization to handle the pole structure in closed strings. Our analysis reveals that the shifted amplitudes contain $\delta$-function poles, which yield simple poles upon taking residues. This allows us to present a general expression for the on-shell recursion relation for closed strings. Additionally, we offer an alternative method for computing the residue of the shifted amplitudes by factorizing an $n$-point closed string amplitude into two lower-point amplitudes. This is achieved by inserting a completeness relation that includes all possible closed string states in the Fock space. Our results are consistent with those previously obtained.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute observables of the critical 3d Ising model to high precision by applying the numerical conformal bootstrap to mixed correlators of the leading scalar operators $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$, and the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. We obtain new precise determinations of scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon) = (0.518148806(24), 1.41262528(29))$ as well as OPE coefficients involving $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $T_{\mu\nu}$. We also describe several improvements made along the way to algorithms and software tools for the numerical bootstrap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The backreaction of quantum degrees of freedom on classical backgrounds is a poorly understood topic in theoretical physics. Most often it is treated within the semiclassical approximation with the help of various ad hoc prescriptions accounting for the effect of quantum excitations on the dynamics of the background. We focus on two popular ones: (i) the mean-field approximation whereby quantum degrees of freedom couple to the classical background via their quantum expectation values; (ii) the (stochastic) Truncated Wigner method whereby the fully coupled system is evolved using classical equations of motion for various randomly sampled initial conditions of the quantum degree of freedom, and a statistical average is performed a posteriori. We evaluate the performance of each method in a simple toy model against a fully quantum mechanical treatment, and identify its regime of validity. We interpret the results in terms of quantum entanglement and loss of classicality of the background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first general relativistic neutrino-radiation simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs using hadron-quark matter equations of state with different onset densities of the first-order QCD phase transition (PT). The collapse forms a proto-neutron star that contracts due to neutrino cooling and softened mixed nuclear-quark matter, leading to a second bounce by deconfined quark matter and a stable proto-hybrid star. The distinct, detectable neutrino bursts and narrow AIC mass range could provide key constraints on hybrid star properties and PT onset density.</description>

      <title>On the New Factorizations of Yang-Mills Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the new factorization pattern for tree-level Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes proposed in a companion paper. This pattern reveals a decomposition of amplitudes into a sum of gluings of lower-point amplitudes under specific kinematic constraints, making the hidden zeros of YM amplitudes manifest. Utilizing the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formalism, we rigorously derive these factorizations by systematically analyzing the contributions of singular solutions to the scattering equations. Through the identification and application of key algebraic identities, we demonstrate how cancellations among terms uncover a recursive structure intricately tied to the hidden zeros. This work not only conclusively validates the proposed factorization but also provides new insights into the geometric and algebraic organization of YM amplitudes within the CHY framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a curious duality between the bosonic sector of heterotic supergravity and the noncritical bosonic string with conformal anomaly. This allows us to map the Mink$_4\times S^3\times S^3$ vacuum of the bosonic string to a new warped $\mathbb R\times (T^{1,1}\times$Mink$_4)$ vacuum of the heterotic theory, which turns out to be supersymmetric, preserving $1/4$ of the supersymmetry. We perform consistent dimensional reduction of the heterotic theory on the warped $\mathbb R\times T^{1,1}$ internal space and obtain ${\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ supergravity, with one complex scalar multiplet and $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ Yang-Mills multiplets, where the gauge symmetry is originated from the isometry group of $T^{1,1}$.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Entanglement Wedge Nesting for Holography at a Finite Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore constraints that arise from associating an entanglement wedge (EW) to subregions of a cutoff boundary at a finite distance in AdS/CFT, using a subcritical end-of-the-world (ETW) brane acting as a cutoff. In particular, we consider the case of two intervals in the holographic dual to a BCFT, with one interval $A$ located at the asymptotic boundary and the second interval $B$ located on the ETW brane. We discuss in detail subtleties that arise near the RT end-points when defining the EW for this configuration, particularly in the connected phase. Entanglement wedge nesting (EWN) requires that $\mathcal{W}_E(A) \cup \mathcal{W}_E(B) \subseteq \mathcal{W}_E(A\cup B)$. We demonstrate that already in the simplest example of an AdS$_3$ bulk geometry, EWN can be violated even if $A$ and $B$ are spacelike separated through the bulk and instead we must require the stronger condition that $\mathcal{W}_E(A)$ be spacelike separated from $\mathcal{W}_E(B)$, which highlights the non-local nature of the cutoff theory. Our prescription to associate EWs to subregions on the ETW brane is different from the restricted maximin procedure in arXiv:2008.07022 but will agree within the subset of parameter space where EWN is respected. Additionally, we study EWN in a two sided BTZ black hole geometry with an ETW brane in one of the exteriors. In the BTZ black hole example we find that our condition for EWN disallows configurations where the RT surface goes from the brane to the black hole singularity.</description>

      <title>Quark-Antiquark Potential as a Probe for Holographic Phase Transitions</title>

Abstract: In the recent paper (Phys.Rev.Lett. 133 (2024) 12, 121601), a higher-order phase transition between the planar, charged, 5-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a hairy black hole solution of the type IIB supergravity was investigated. Here, we set out to investigate these two phases of the theory by means of the holographic probe that describes a quark-antiquark in the dual gauge theory. We show that the study of the quark-antiquark potential turns out to be a useful method to investigate the change of behavior at different values of the parameter that controls the phase transition, this parameter being the ratio between the chemical potential and the temperature. In other words, the string serves as a probe to detect the phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct families of integrable deformations that interpolate between $AdS_3\times S^3\times S^3\times S^1$ and either $AdS_3\times S^3\times S^2\times T^2$ or $AdS_3\times S^2\times S^2\times T^3$. They preserve half of the supersymmetry of the original background, namely one copy of the $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)$ algebra. From this it follows a similar integrable interpolation between $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ and $AdS_3\times S^2\times T^5$, which also preserves half of the supersymmetry, namely a copy of the $\mathfrak{psu}(1,1|2)$ algebra. In all cases, the interpolating backgrounds are constructed by using TsT transformations, which makes it easy to implement them in the integrability formalism in the full quantum theory. To illustrate this point, we discuss the lightcone gauge fixing of the models and compute their pp-wave Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>The Mechanism behind the Information Encoding for Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement islands are subregions in a gravitational universe whose information is fully encoded in a disconnected non-gravitational system away from it. In the context of the black hole information paradox, entanglement islands state that the information about the black hole interior is encoded in the early-time Hawking radiation. Nevertheless, it was unclear how this seemingly nonlocal information encoding emerges from a manifestly local theory. In this paper, we provide an answer to this question by uncovering the mechanism behind this information encoding scheme. As we will see, the early understanding that graviton is massive in island models plays an essential role in this mechanism. As an example, we will discuss how this mechanism works in detail in the Karch-Randall braneworld. This study also suggests the potential importance of this mechanism to the ER=EPR conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from an elementary calculation of super Lie group elements associating with non(anti)-commutative Grassmann parameters, we derive several closed expressions of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula which represent multiplication properties of super Lie group elements in the corresponding superspace. We then show that parametrization of superspace in general may become infinite dimensional due to the presence of non(anti)commutativity. We show that a Dirac-K\"ahler Twisted SUSY Algebra (also referred to as Marcus B-type Twisted SUSY Algebra or Geometric Langlands Twisted SUSY Algebra) with a certain type of deformation, which we call an exponential deformation, may circumvent this problem. We also provide, in terms of gauge covariantization of the SUSY algebra, a geometric understanding of the exponential deformation, and see that the framework constructed in this paper may serve as a non(anti)commutative superspace framework providing the gauge covariant link formulation of twisted super Yang-Mills on a lattice.</description>

Abstract: The Witten index of the Hilbert space of the $(2,0)$-theory compactified on spaces of the form $S^3/\Gamma\times S^2$, with a freely acting group $\Gamma$, and with external string sources implemented via timelike surface operator insertions, is expressed in terms of Ray-Singer torsion of $S^3/\Gamma$ and characters of irreducible representations of $\Gamma$. We compute it explicitly for the Dicyclic groups $\Gamma=\text{Dic}_k$. The torsion and characters are generally irrational numbers, but they nicely combine to an integer index. The results suggest fusion relations among the string sources with integer coefficients expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate local quench dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theories using Krylov space methods. We derive Lanczos coefficients, spread complexity, and Krylov entropies for local joining and splitting quenches in theories on an infinite line, a circle, a finite interval, and at finite temperature. We examine how these quantities depend on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and find that both spread complexity and Krylov entropy are proportional to it. Interestingly, Krylov entropies evolve logarithmically with time, mirroring standard entanglement entropies, making them useful for extracting the central charge. In the large central charge limit, using holography, we establish a connection between the rate of spread complexity and the proper momentum of the tip of the end-of-the world brane, which probes the bulk analogously to a point particle. Our results further demonstrate that spread complexity and Krylov entropies are powerful tools for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Maximum Conformality Correctly Resolves the Renormalization-Scheme-Dependence Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify a serious misinterpretation and consequent misuse of the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), which also can be served as a mini review of PMC. We emphasize that the purpose of the PMC is to achieve precise fixed-order pQCD predictions, free from conventional renormalization scheme and scale ambiguities. We demonstrate that the PMC predictions satisfy all of the self-consistency conditions of the renormalization group and standard renormalization-group invariance; the PMC predictions are thus independent of any initial choice of renormalization scheme and scale. The scheme independence of the PMC is also ensured by commensurate scale relations which relate different observables to each other. Moreover, in the Abelian limit, the PMC dovetails into the well-known Gell-Mann--Low framework, a method universally revered for its precision in QED calculations. Due to the elimination of factorially-divergent renormalon terms, the PMC series not only attains a convergence behavior far superior to that of its conventional counterparts but also deftly curtails any residual scale dependence caused by the unknown higher-order terms. This refined convergence, coupled with its robust suppression of residual uncertainties, furnishes a sound and reliable foundation for estimating the contributions from unknown higher-order terms. Anchored in the bedrock of standard renormalization group invariance, the PMC simultaneously eradicates the factorial divergences and eliminates superfluous systematic errors, which inversely provides a good foundation for achieving high-precision pQCD predictions. Consequently, owing to its rigorous theoretical underpinnings, the PMC is eminently applicable to virtually all high-energy hadronic processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the propagation of information through quantum many-body systems, developed to study quantum chaos, have found many application from black holes to disordered spin systems. Among other quantitative tools, Krylov complexity has been explored as a diagnostic tool for information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a universal limit to the growth of the Krylov complexity in dissipative open quantum systems by utilizing the uncertainty relation for non-hermitian operators. We also present the analytical results of Krylov complexity for characteristic behavior of Lanczos coefficients in dissipative systems. The validity of these results are demonstrated by explicit study of transverse-field Ising model under dissipative effects.</description>

      <title>Solving lattice gauge theories using the quantum Krylov algorithm and qubitization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{O}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{O}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of thermal active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for energy balance, local temperature variations, and the ensuing stochastic effects. By modelling active matter as a driven open system, we show that the source of active contributions to hydrodynamics, violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and detailed balance is rooted in the breaking of time-translation symmetry due to the presence of fuel consumption and an external environmental bath. In addition, our framework allows for non-equilibrium steady states that produce entropy, with a well-defined notion of steady-state temperature. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions. We also show how to incorporate temperature, energy and noise in fluctuating hydrodynamics for active matter. Our work suggests a broader perspective on active matter that can leave an imprint across scales.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Collisional corrections to spin polarization from quantum kinetic theory using Chapman-Enskog expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the collisional corrections to the spin polarization pseudo-vector, $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$, using quantum kinetic theory in Chapman-Enskog expansion. We derive the spin Boltzmann equation incorporating M{\o}ller scattering process. We further consider two distinct scenarios using hard thermal loop approximations for simplification. In scenario (I), the vector charge distribution function is treated as off-equilibrium under the validity domain of gradient expansion. Remarkably, the polarization induced by gradients of thermal chemical potential and shear viscous tensors are modified, but $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario does not depend on the coupling constant. In scenario (II), the vector charge distribution function is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Then collisional corrections $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario are at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^{2}\partial^{2})$. Additionally, we evaluate the $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$ using relaxation time approach for comparative analysis. Our results establish the theoretical framework necessary for the future numerical investigations on the interaction corrections to spin polarization.</description>

      <title>(SPT-)LSM theorems from projective non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove an SPT-LSM theorem: any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Conformal Leptogenesis in Composite Higgs Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of the baryon asymmetry in Composite Higgs models with partial compositeness of the Standard Model (SM) fermions and heavy right-handed neutrinos, developing for the first time a complete picture of leptogenesis in that setup. The asymmetry is induced by the out of equilibrium decays of the heavy right-handed neutrinos into a plasma of the nearly conformal field theory (CFT), i.e. the deconfined phase of the Composite Higgs dynamics. This exotic mechanism, which we call Conformal Leptogenesis, admits a reliable description in terms of a set of ``Boltzmann equations'' whose coefficients can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of the CFT. The asymmetry thus generated is subsequently affected by the supercooling resulting from the confining phase transition of the strong Higgs sector as well as by the washout induced by the resonances formed after the transition. Nevertheless, a qualitative description of the latter effects suggests that conformal leptogenesis can successfully reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry in a wide region of parameter space. A distinctive signature of our scenarios is a sizable compositeness for all the generations of SM neutrinos, which is currently consistent with all constraints but may be within reach of future colliders.</description>

      <title>Flavor Patterns of Fundamental Particles from Quantum Entanglement?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, which controls flavor mixing between the three generations of quark fermions, is a key input to the Standard Model of particle physics. In this paper, we identify a surprising connection between quantum entanglement and the degree of quark mixing. Focusing on a specific limit of $2 \to 2$ quark scattering mediated by electroweak bosons, we find that the quantum entanglement generated by scattering is minimized when the CKM matrix is almost (but not exactly) diagonal, in qualitative agreement with observation. With the discovery of neutrino masses and mixings, additional angles are needed to parametrize the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the lepton sector. Applying the same logic, we find that quantum entanglement is minimized when the PMNS matrix features two large angles and a smaller one, again in qualitative agreement with observation, plus a hint for suppressed CP violation. We speculate on the (unlikely but tantalizing) possibility that minimization of quantum entanglement might be a fundamental principle that determines particle physics input parameters.</description>

Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the Z2-graded Hopf algebras. To present the constructions, we consider in detail the Borel half of Uq(sl(2)) and two super Hopf algebra examples: the Borel half of Uq(osp(1|2)) and the Borel half of Uq(gl(1|1)) for q being a root of unity. We prove the isomorphism between the Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras, which is missing in the literature, and extend the isomorphism to the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the Z2-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory [1, 2], as well as illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the full Uq(gl(1|1)) Hopf algebra. In addition, we generalise an isomorphism between the Drinfeld double and the loop algebra from the combinatorial quantisation to the graded setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the aim of progressing toward a practical implementation of an effective quantum-electrodynamics (QED) theory of atoms and molecules, which includes the effects of vacuum polarization through the creation of virtual electron-positron pairs but without the explicit photon degrees of freedom, we study a one-dimensional effective QED model of the hydrogen-like atom with delta-potential interactions. This model resembles the three-dimensional effective QED theory with Coulomb interactions while being substantially simpler. We provide some mathematical details about the definition of this model, calculate the vacuum-polarization density, and the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy, correcting and extending results of previous works. We also study the approximation of the model in a finite plane-wave basis, and in particular we discuss the basis convergence of the bound-state energy and eigenfunction, of the vacuum-polarization density, and of the Lamb-type shift of the bound-state energy. We highlight the difficulty of converging the vacuum-polarization density in a finite basis and we propose a way to improve it. The present work could give hints on how to perform similar calculations for the three-dimensional effective QED theory of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantitative classicality in cosmological interactions during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the classical and quantum evolution of inflationary cosmological perturbations from quantum initial conditions, using the on-shell and off-shell contributions to correlators to investigate the signatures of interactions. In particular, we calculate the Keldysh contributions to the leading order bispectrum from past infinity, showing that the squeezed limit is dominated by the on-shell evolution. By truncating the time integrals in the analytic expressions for contributions to the bispectrum, we define a `quantum interactivity' and quantitatively identify scales and times for which it is sufficient to only assume classical evolution, given a fixed precision. In contrast to typical perceptions inspired by free two-point functions, we show that common non-linear contributions to inflationary perturbations can be well-described by classical evolution even prior to horizon crossing. The insights gained here can pave the way for quantitative criteria for justifying the validity of numerically simulating the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations in inflation. In particular, we comment on the validity of using stochastic inflation to reproduce known in-in perturbative results. An extensive appendix provides a review of the Keldysh formulation of the in-in formalism with the initial state set at a finite, as opposed to infinite past, emphasizing the importance of considering temporal boundary terms and the initial state for correctly obtaining the propagators. We also show how stochastic dynamics can emerge as a sufficiently accurate approximation to the full quantum evolution. This becomes particularly transparent in the Keldysh description.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Waterfall: a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation with Page curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation based on the analogy of the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) when the black hole (pump) is allowed to deplete to zero mass. The model incorporates an additional new feature that allows for the interior Hawking partner-particles (idlers) behind the horizon to further generate new Hawking particle pairs of lower energy, one of which remains behind the horizon, and the other that adds to the externally emitted Hawking radiation (signals) outside the horizon. This model produces a Page curve for the evolution of the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black hole internal degrees of freedom entangled with the generated Hawking radiation pairs entangled across the horizon. The Page curve yields an entropy that rises at early times during the evaporation process as Hawking pairs are generated, reaches a peak midway through the evolution, and then decays to zero upon complete evaporation of the black hole. The entire system remains in a pure state at all times undergoing unitary (squeezed state) evolution, with the initial state of the black hole modeled as a bosonic Fock state of large, but finite number $n_{p0}$ of particles. For the final state of the system, the black hole reaches the vacuum state of zero mass, while the external Hawking radiation carries away the total energy of the initial black hole. Inside the horizon there remains $n_{p0}$ Hawking partner-particles of vanishingly small total energy, reminiscent of the "soft-hair" (zero energy) qubit model of Hotta, Nambu and Yamaguchi, but now from a Hamiltonian for squeezed state generation perspective. The model presented here can be readily extended to encompass arbitrary initial pure states for the black hole, and in falling matter.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric dipole form factor in QCD vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States in Field Theory: No Partial Factorization, Multi-Particle Packaging, and Hybrid Gauge-Invariant Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum field excitations can generate packaged entangled states, in which all internal quantum numbers (IQNs) (e.g., electric charge, flavor, and color) are inseparably entangled and constrained to irreducible representation (irrep) blocks. This is a consequence of local gauge invariance and superselection rules. The confinement restricts the net gauge charge to a single superselection sector, thereby excluding cross-sector superpositions but allowing entanglement within one sector. We establish theorems that: \textbf{(1)} Explain how these packaged entangled states naturally arise from quantum field excitations, \textbf{(2)} Show how they remain gauge invariant or transform covariantly within a fixed net-charge sector, and \textbf{(3)} Illustrate how external degrees of freedom (DOFs) (e.g., spin or momentum) can combine with packaged internal charges to yield gauge-invariant entanglement. Finally, we show that spin or momentum measurements on these hybrid states induce a collapse of the internal entanglement.</description>

      <title>Symplectic (Non-)Invariance of the Free Energy in Topological Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F_g$ be the free energy derived from Topological Recursion for a given spectral curve on a compact Riemann surface, and let $F_g^\vee$ be its $x$-$y$ dual, that is, the free energy derived from the same spectral curve with the roles of $x$ and $y$ interchanged. $F_g$ is sometimes called a symplectic invariant due to its invariance under certain symplectomorphisms of the formal symplectic form $dx\wedge dy$. However, the free energy is not generally invariant under the swap of $x$ and $y$; thus, the difference $F_g - F_g^\vee$ is nonzero.
  We derive a new formula for this difference for all $g\geq 2$ in terms of a residue calculation at the singularities of $x$ and $y$, including cases where $x$ and $y$ have logarithmic singularities. For the derivation, we apply recent developments from $x$-$y$ duality within the theory of (Logarithmic) Topological Recursion. The derived formulas are particularly useful for spectral curves with a trivial $x$-$y$ dual side, meaning those with vanishing $F_g^\vee$. In such cases, one obtains an explicit result for $F_{g\geq 2}$ itself.
  We apply this to several classes of spectral curves and prove, for instance, a recent conjecture by Borot et al. that the free energies $F_g$ computed by Topological Recursion for the "Gaiotto curve" coincide with the perturbative part (in the $\Omega$-background) of the Nekrasov partition function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory. Similar computations also provide $F_g$ for the CDO curve related to Hurwitz numbers, or the negative $r$-spin curve related to $\Theta$-class intersection numbers on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$.</description>

      <title>Love numbers beyond GR from the modified Teukolsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the full set of tidal Love numbers of non-rotating black holes in an effective field theory extension of general relativity. We achieve our results using a recently introduced modified Teukolsky equation that describes the perturbations of black holes in this theory. We show how to identify the Love numbers and their beta functions in a systematic and gauge invariant way, applying analytic continuation on the angular number $\ell$ when necessary. We observe that there are three types of Love numbers: electric, magnetic, and a ``mixing'' type, associated to parity-breaking theories, that we identify here for the first time. The modified Teukolsky equation proves to be very useful as it allows us to obtain all the different Love numbers in a unified framework. We compare our results with previous literature that utilized the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations to compute Love numbers, finding perfect agreement. The method introduced here paves the way towards the computation of Love numbers of rotating black holes beyond general relativity.</description>
