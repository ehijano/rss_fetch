      <title>Color Refinement for Relational Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color Refinement, also known as Naive Vertex Classification, is a classical method to distinguish graphs by iteratively computing a coloring of their vertices. While it is mainly used as an imperfect way to test for isomorphism, the algorithm permeated many other, seemingly unrelated, areas of computer science. The method is algorithmically simple, and it has a well-understood distinguishing power: It is logically characterized by Cai, F\"urer and Immerman (1992), who showed that it distinguishes precisely those graphs that can be distinguished by a sentence of first-order logic with counting quantifiers and only two variables. A combinatorial characterization is given by Dvo\v{r}\'ak (2010), who shows that it distinguishes precisely those graphs that can be distinguished by the number of homomorphisms from some tree.
  In this paper, we introduce Relational Color Refinement (RCR, for short), a generalization of the Color Refinement method from graphs to arbitrary relational structures, whose distinguishing power admits the equivalent combinatorial and logical characterizations as Color Refinement has on graphs: We show that RCR distinguishes precisely those structures that can be distinguished by the number of homomorphisms from an acyclic relational structure. Further, we show that RCR distinguishes precisely those structures that can be distinguished by a sentence of the guarded fragment of first-order logic with counting quantifiers.</description>

      <title>Regenerative Ulam-von Neumann Algorithm: An Innovative Markov chain Monte Carlo Method for Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the classical Ulan-von Neumann Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm for the computation of the matrix inverse. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed as \emph{regenerative Ulam-von Neumann algorithm}, utilizes the regenerative structure of classical, non-truncated Neumann series defined by a non-singular matrix and produces an unbiased estimator of the matrix inverse. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm depends on a single parameter that controls the total number of Markov transitions simulated thus avoiding the challenge of balancing between the total number of Markov chain replications and its corresponding length as in the classical Ulam-von Neumann algorithm. To efficiently utilize the Markov chain transition samples in the calculation of the regenerative quantities, the proposed algorithm quantifies automatically the contribution of each Markov transition to all regenerative quantities by a carefully designed updating scheme that utilized three separate matrices containing the current weights, total weights, and regenerative cycle count, respectively. A probabilistic analysis of the performance of the algorithm, including the variance of the estimator, is provided. Finally, numerical experiments verify the qualitative effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time recognition and maximum independent set in Burling graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Burling graph is an induced subgraph of some graph in Burling's construction of triangle-free high-chromatic graphs. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm which decides whether a given graph is a Burling graph and if it is, constructs its intersection model by rectangular frames. That model enables a polynomial-time algorithm for the maximum independent set problem in Burling graphs. As a consequence, we establish Burling graphs as the first known hereditary class of graphs that admits such an algorithm while not being $\chi$-bounded.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Distribution on "Short" Integer Partitions with Power Parts: Limit Laws and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the asymptotic analysis of a family of Boltzmann (multiplicative) distributions over the set $\check{\varLambda}^{q}$ of strict integer partitions (i.e., with unequal parts) into perfect $q$-th powers. A combinatorial link is provided via a suitable conditioning by fixing the partition weight (the sum of parts) and length (the number of parts), leading to uniform distribution on the corresponding subspaces of partitions. The Boltzmann measure is calibrated through the hyper-parameters $\langle N\rangle$ and $\langle M\rangle$ controlling the expected weight and length, respectively. We study ``short'' partitions, where the parameter $\langle M\rangle$ is either fixed or grows slower than for typical plain (unconstrained) partitions. For this model, we obtain a variety of limit theorems including the asymptotics of the cumulative cardinality in the case of fixed $\langle M\rangle$ and a limit shape result in the case of slow growth of $\langle M\rangle$. In both cases, we also characterize the joint distribution of the weight and length, as well as the growth of the smallest and largest parts. Using these results we construct suitable sampling algorithms and analyse their performance.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs: results and problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an expository paper. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. E.g., a cycle in the sense of graph theory is a $1$-cycle, but not vice versa. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. In this text we study the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all 1-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of 1-cycles in a given graph such that any 1-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We also consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, and to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Equality cases of the Alexandrov--Fenchel inequality are not in the polynomial hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing the equality conditions of the Alexandrov--Fenchel inequality has been a major open problem for decades. We prove that in the case of convex polytopes, this description is not in the polynomial hierarchy unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level. This is the first hardness result for the problem, and is a complexity counterpart of the recent result by Shenfeld and van Handel (arXiv:archive/201104059), which gave a geometric characterization of the equality conditions. The proof involves Stanley's order polytopes and employs poset theoretic technology.</description>

      <title>Arborescences and Shortest Path Trees when Colors Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color-constrained subgraph problems are those where we are given an edge-colored (directed or undirected) graph and the task is to find a specific type of subgraph, like a spanning tree, an arborescence, a single-source shortest path tree, a perfect matching etc., with constraints on the number of edges of each color. Some of these problems, like color-constrained spanning tree, have elegant solutions and some of them, like color-constrained perfect matching, are longstanding open questions. In this work, we study color-constrained arborescences and shortest path trees. Computing a color-constrained shortest path tree on weighted digraphs turns out to be NP-hard in general but polynomial-time solvable when all cycles have positive weight. This polynomial-time solvability is due to the fact that the solution space is essentially the set of all color-constrained arborescences of a directed acyclic subgraph of the original graph. While finding color-constrained arborescence of digraphs is NP-hard in general, we give efficient algorithms when the input graph is acyclic. Consequently, a color-constrained shortest path tree on weighted digraphs having only positive weight cycles can be efficiently computed. Our algorithms also generalize to the problem of finding a color-constrained shortest path tree with minimum total weight. En route, we sight nice connections to colored matroids and color-constrained bases.</description>
