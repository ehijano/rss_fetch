      <title>Probing electronic transitions and defect-induced Urbach tail bands in functional perovskite oxides using diffuse reflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a detailed study of electronic transitions and defects induced Urbach tail bands in various functional perovskite oxides (V2O5, BaSnO3, PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3, BiMnO3, and BiFeO3) using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). We analyzed their DRS spectra using the Kubelka-Munk (KM) function, the Tauc plot, and the first derivative of the reflectance for a comparative study. BiMnO3 exhibits an electronic transition with indirect band gap energy, Eg = 0.92 eV. In contrast, all other functional perovskite oxides, namely bulk V2O5, BaSnO3, PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3, and BiFeO3, show direct band gap interband transitions, with Eg values of 2.27, 3.25, 3.10, and 2.48 eV, respectively. The estimated Urbach energy (EU) values related to the induced defects in these direct band gap functional oxides are approximately 0.24, 0.38, 0.25, and 0.48 eV, respectively. Moreover, a reduction in the band gap energy of multiferroic BiFeO3 was observed due to induced chemical pressure from (Ba, Ca) doping and a decrease in particle size. Importantly, the evaluated band gap and Urbach energies of the functional perovskite oxide materials obtained from the analyses of the first derivative of reflectance and the Tauc plot method align remarkably well with the values deduced using the Kubelka-Munk function theory. Effectively, we propose a comprehensive electronic band structure for the multiferroic BiFeO3, an important material for optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaic, photocatalytic, and photoferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spontaneous Exciton Dissociation via Phonon Emission in BiVO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO$_4$) is a promising indirect band gap semiconductor for photoelectrochemical water splitting, yet the characteristics of its low-lying photoexcitations, or excitons, remain poorly understood. Here, we use an ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach that incorporates phonon screening to compute the nature and lifetimes of the low-lying excitons of m-BiVO$_4$. Our calculations indicate that at 0 K, the lowest-lying exciton energy exceeds the indirect band gap, enabling spontaneous dissociation into free carriers via phonon emission within picoseconds. At 300 K, both phonon emission and absorption effects reduce this timescale to only a few femtoseconds. Phonon screening also greatly reduces the binding energy of the lowest-lying exciton, leading to an optical absorption spectrum that better reproduces experimental measurements. Overall, our findings establish the general conditions under which phonon emission-driven exciton dissociation can occur in indirect gap semiconductors, and they emphasize the critical role phonon screening can play in predictive calculations of photophysical properties of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Surface Sensitive Raman Response of Metal-Supported Monolayer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Raman spectrum of monolayer (ML) MoS$_2$ is remarkably affected by the interaction with metals. In this work we studied ML-MoS$_2$ supported by the Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The MoS$_2$ layer was directly grown on atomically clean Ag(111) and Ag(110) surfaces by pulsed laser deposition, followed by in-situ thermal annealing under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The morphology and structure of the two systems were characterized in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy, providing atomic-scale information on the relation between the MoS$_2$ lattice and the underlying surface. Raman spectroscopy revealed differences between the two MoS$_2$-metal interfaces, especially concerning the behavior of the out-of-plane $A'_1$ vibrational mode, which splits into two contributions on Ag(110). The metal-induced effects on MoS$_2$ vibrational modes are further evidenced by transferring MoS$_2$ onto a more inert substrate (SiO$_2$/Si), where the MoS$_2$ Raman response displays a more ``freestanding-like'' behavior. The experimental data were interpreted with the support of ab-initio calculations of the vibrational modes, which provided insight into the effect of interface properties, such as strain and out-of-plane distortion. Our results highlight the influence of the interaction with metals on MoS$_2$ vibrational properties, and show the high sensitivity of MoS$_2$ Raman modes to the surface structure of the supporting metal.</description>

      <title>Phase Transformation Kinetics Model for Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new model for phase transformation kinetics in metals by generalizing the Levitas-Preston (LP) phase field model of martensite phase transformations (see Levitas and Preston (2002a,b); Levitas, Preston and Lee (2003)) to arbitrary pressure. Furthermore, we account for and track: the interface speed of the pressure driven phase transformation, properties of critical nuclei, as well as nucleation at grain sites and on dislocations and homogeneous nucleation. The volume fraction evolution of each phase is described by employing KJMA (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl, 1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) kinetic theory. We then test our new model for iron under ramp loading conditions and compare our predictions for the $\alpha\to\epsilon$ iron phase transition to experimental data of Smith et al. (2013). More than one combination of material and model parameters (such as dislocation density and interface speed) led to good agreement of our simulations to the experimental data, thus highlighting the importance of having accurate characterization data regarding the microstructure of the sample in question.</description>

      <title>Interfaces in epitaxially grown Zn3P2 nanowires and their composition dependent optoelectronic properties for photovoltaic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxially grown nanowires have shown promise for photovoltaic applications due to their nanophotonic properties. Moreover, the mechanical properties of nanowires can reduce crystallographic defect formation at interfaces to help enable new material combinations for photovoltaics. One material that stands to benefit from the nanowire morphology is zinc phosphide (Zn3P2), which despite promising optoelectronic properties has experienced limited applicability due to challenges achieving heteroepitaxy, stemming from its large lattice parameter and coefficient of thermal expansion. Herein, we identify the requirements for successful epitaxy of Zn3P2 nanowires using metalorganic chemical vapour deposition and the impact on interface structure and defect formation. Furthermore, using high-throughput optical spectroscopy we were able to demonstrate shifts in the photoluminescence intensity and energy by tuning the V/II ratio during growth, highlighting the compositional tunability of the optoelectronic properties of Zn3P2 nanowires.</description>

      <title>Space-Charge Limited Schottky Diodes with Wide-Bandgap Thin-film Oxide Heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-crystalline thin-film Schottky diodes are cost-effective but often exhibit unreliable electrical characteristics due to material imperfections. In this work, I present a Schottky diode structure utilizing in-situ grown Ta2O5 and ZnO thin films deposited at room temperature. The low conduction band offset across the interface of the heterogeneous oxides facilitates efficient electron injection under forward bias. Capacitance-voltage characterization reveals a robust Schottky barrier at the Au/Ta2O5 interface without a significant barrier thinning effect, enabling high-voltage breakdown up to 65V and a high on/off ratio of 1X$10^8$. In demonstrations, the thin-film structure shows Schottky contact characteristics using even a relatively low work function metal of ITO, allowing the operation of transparent Schottky diodes. The diodes show additional potential for applications, including RF-to-DC conversion leveraging space charge capacitance at the Ta2O5/ZnO junction and rectifying resistive random access memory devices. This work highlights a promising approach for integrating low-cost, high-reliability Schottky diodes into back-end-of-line processes for wireless electronics and power devices.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Morphological Transformations of a Ag-Cu Nanocatalyst During CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conversion of CO2 into high-value chemicals through a photoreduction reaction in water is a promising route to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Ag nanoparticles can drive this reaction via localized surface plasmon resonance, but their low selectivity limits usage in industry. Enhancing selectivity toward hydrocarbons or alcohols requires addition of a co-catalyst such as Cu. However, the stabilized surface state created by Ag-Cu interactions is still poorly understood. In this work, soft x-ray Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and Grazing-Incidence X-ray Scattering (AP-GIXS) were used to investigate the evolution of Ag-Cu nanoparticles under CO2RR-like conditions. AP-XPS revealed Ag and Cu surface and sub-surface diffusion, while AP-GIXS tracked change of shape and size of nanoparticles induced by diffusion mechanics. Under 532 nm laser irradiation, further oxidation of Cu and Ag sub-surface diffusion were observed, providing invaluable insights into the dynamic restructuring of the catalyst under reaction conditions.</description>

      <title>Polarization-dependent photocurrent in a quadrilateral-shaped bulk crystalline tellurium chip with near-infrared light excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A circular polarization-dependent photocurrent is exclusively observed along the direction parallel to the helical axis in millimeter-sized quadrilateral-shaped bulk crystalline tellurium samples. The deterioration of the polarization-dependent character of unclear origin is also recorded. The estimate of the gyrotropic photoconductivity constant Betha in the context of the circular photogalvanic effect yields the value of approximately 5 micro-A/W based on experimental results obtained under a relatively weak excitation of 1.7 W/cm2. A comparison of this Betha value with those reported in previous studies is also discussed. Enhancement of Betha value may be achievable with bulk samples of superior crystalline quality.</description>

      <title>A Method to Suppress Polar Kerr Signal in a Longitudinal Magneto-Optic-Kerr-Effect Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magneto-Optical-Kerr-Effect (MOKE) is a convenient technique to study the magnetization of thin films. However, both polar and longitudinal MOKE responses contribute to the total Kerr response in a typical longitudinal MOKE measurement. Here, we present a simple optical technique to suppress the polar MOKE response in the oblique angle incidence by exploiting differences between polar and longitudinal MOKE responses upon double reflection from the sample. By using a mirror to reflect the beam and by selectively using a quarter waveplate, the polar or longitudinal MOKE signals can be suppressed, and therefore studied separately using the same oblique experimental setup. To demonstrate the feasibility of this technique, we use an out-of-plane magnetized Pt/Co/Pt film as well as a Pt/Co/Cu/NiFe Heterostructure with both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization. We show that the polar MOKE of the CoPt film can be suppressed by a factor of 6 compared to a conventional MOKE measurement. By accounting for birefringence, we further reduce the polar MOKE response in a longitudinal MOKE measurement of the Pt/Co/Cu/NiFe film by over 160 times compared to a conventional oblique-angle MOKE measurement.</description>

      <title>A dual-scale stochastic analysis framework for creep failure considering microstructural randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creep failure under high temperatures is a complex multiscale and multi-mechanism issue involving inherent microstructural randomness. To investigate the effect of microstructures on the uniaxial/multiaxial creep failure, a dual-scale stochastic analysis framework is established to introduce the grain boundary (GB) characteristics into the macroscopic analysis. The nickel-base superalloy Inconel 617 is considered in this study. Firstly, the damage mechanisms of GBs are investigated based on the crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) method and cohesive zone model (CZM). Subsequently, based on the obtained GB damage evolution, a novel Monte Carlo (MC) approach is proposed to establish the relationship between the GB orientation and area distribution and macroscopic creep damage. Finally, a dual-scale stochastic multiaxial creep damage model is established to incorporate the influence of the random GB orientation and area distribution. With the numerical application of the proposed creep damage model, the random initiation and growth of creep cracks in the uniaxial tensile specimen and the pressurized tube are captured and analyzed. The proposed stochastic framework effectively considers the inherent randomness introduced by GB characteristics and efficiently realizes full-field multiscale calculations. It also shows its potential applications in safety evaluation and life prediction of creep components and structures under high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Cascading symmetry constraint during machine learning-enabled structural search for sulfur induced Cu(111)-$(\sqrt{43}\times\sqrt{43})$ surface reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how exploiting symmetry when creating and modifying structural models may speed up global atomistic structure optimization. We propose a search strategy in which models start from high symmetry configurations and then gradually evolve into lower symmetry models. The algorithm is named cascading symmetry search and is shown to be highly efficient for a number of known surface reconstructions. We use our method for the sulfur induced Cu (111) $(\sqrt{43}\times\sqrt{43})$ surface reconstruction for which we identify a new highly stable structure which conforms with experimental evidence.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of four-phonon scattering in the lattice thermal transport of LaMoN$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) of LaMoN$_3$ in the $C$2/$c$ and $R$3$c$ phases using first-principles calculations combined with the Boltzmann transport equation. In the $C$2/$c$ phase, $\kappa_L$ exhibits strong anisotropy, with values of 0.75 W/mK, 1.89 W/mK, and 0.82 W/mK along the a, b, and c axes, respectively, at 300 K. In contrast, the $R$3$c$ phase shows nearly isotropic thermal conductivity, with values of 6.28 W/mK, 7.05 W/mK, and 7.31 W/mK along the a, b, and c directions. In both phases, acoustic phonons dominate thermal transport. However, in the $C$2/$c$ phase, the absence of an acoustic-optical gap results in increased three-phonon scattering leading to smaller values of $\kappa_L$. Additionally, four-phonon scattering plays a dominant role in the C2/c phase, reducing $\kappa_L$ by approximately 96\%, whereas in the $R3c$ phase, it leads to a smaller but still significant reduction of ~50\%. These results highlight the critical role of four-phonon interactions in determining the thermal transport properties of LaMoN$_3$ and reveal the stark contrast in thermal conductivity between its two structural phases.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Volume Collapse and Metallization in Inverse Spinel Co$_2$TiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural, vibrational, electronic, and magnetic properties of inverse spinel $Co_2TiO_4$ (CTO-Sp) under high pressure (HP) conditions are systematically investigated using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, in situ optical microscopy, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At ambient conditions, CTO-Sp exhibits a cubic phase with a space group $Fd\bar{3}m$ and it undergoes two notable structural phase transitions at HP. The first transition, occurring at approximately 7.2 GPa, leads to the tetragonal-$I4_1/amd$ phase with minimal alteration in unit cell volume. Subsequently, a second transition to an orthorhombic phase with a mixed space group $Fddd$ and $Cmcm$ is observed around 17.3 GPa. This second structural transition corresponds to a first-order phase transition involving a significant reduction in unit cell volume of approximately 17.5$\%$. The bulk compressibility of CTO-Sp and its HP post-spinel phases is almost equal to the average polyhedral compressibility within each phase. The absence of Raman modes beyond 23 GPa is compelling evidence for metallization. DFT calculations reveal a high-spin to low-spin transition, accompanied by the collapse of local magnetic moments in the Cmcm orthorhombic phase, leading to the sample's pressure-induced metallization.</description>

      <title>Driving collective current excitations using light: The time-dependent $GW$ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-electron interactions in solids give rise to longitudinal collective charge excitations known as plasmons, which are observable corresponding to resonances in the density-density response function of the electrons. In this study, we demonstrate that current-current interactions can induce a novel type of collective excitation for systems of noninteracting and interacting electrons under nonequilibrium conditions, which we term as "curron". By taking into account the interaction between the vector potential generated by electronic currents and the vector potential driving them, we construct a system of interacting currents mediated by vector potentials. We show that this leads to the emergence of a quasiparticle associated with transverse collective current excitations, corresponding to resonances in the current-current response function. We account for electron-electron interaction by solving the Kadanoff-Baym equations within the non-equilibrium two-time GW approach using sodium metal as our prototypical metal.</description>

      <title>Complex magnetic exchange, anisotropy and skyrmionic textures in two-dimensional FeXZ$_{2}$ (\textit{X} = Nb, Ta and \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te) ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FeNbTe$_{2}$, long known as a van der Waals metallic system, has recently been resynthesized and shown to exhibit ferromagnetic order. In this study, using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we aim to provide a deeper insight into the magnetic properties of FeNbTe$_{2}$ and its related compounds (FeXZ$_{2}$, \textit{X} = Nb, Ta; \textit{Z} = S, Se, Te), in their two-dimensional form, including their non-centrosymmetric Janus counterparts. Our results indicate that these materials are energetically, dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, supporting the possibility of FeNbTe$_{2}$ exfoliation and potential for experimental realization of new compounds. An evolutionary structure search suggests that FeNbTe$_{2}$ retains its monoclinic symmetry in the monolayer form. Our analysis of hopping parameters obtained from Wannierization of DFT bands shows that the nearest-neighbor magnetic interactions are primarily direct, while second-nearest and more distant interactions are mediated by the chalcogen atoms. Interestingly, although the second-nearest-neighbor interactions are smaller in magnitude, they appear to play a key role in determining the magnetic ordering in these systems. We also find evidence of canted magnetic anisotropy in FeXZ$_{2}$ compounds, with relatively strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and easy-axis deviations of up to 41$^\circ$ from the out-of-plane direction-an uncommon and potentially useful feature for spintronic applications. Curie temperatures estimated from Monte Carlo simulations are below room temperature but above cryogenic levels for most compounds. Micromagnetic simulations revealed that Janus-structured FeNbSeTe can host N\'eel-type skyrmions even in the absence of an external magnetic field, making this compound a suitable candidate for further experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Inorganic Materials Design with Generative AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing inorganic crystalline materials with tailored properties is critical to technological innovation, yet current generative computational methods often struggle to efficiently explore desired targets with sufficient interpretability. Here, we present MatAgent, a generative approach for inorganic materials discovery that harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By combining a diffusion-based generative model for crystal structure estimation with a predictive model for property evaluation, MatAgent uses iterative, feedback-driven guidance to steer material exploration precisely toward user-defined targets. Integrated with external cognitive tools-including short-term memory, long-term memory, the periodic table, and a comprehensive materials knowledge base-MatAgent emulates human expert reasoning to vastly expand the accessible compositional space. Our results demonstrate that MatAgent robustly directs exploration toward desired properties while consistently achieving high compositional validity, uniqueness, and material novelty. This framework thus provides a highly interpretable, practical, and versatile AI-driven solution to accelerate the discovery and design of next-generation inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>Database of Tensorial Optical and Transport Properties of Materials From the Wannier Function Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and design of functional materials for energy harvesting and electronic applications require accurate predictions of their optical and transport properties. While several existing databases contain the first-order optical properties and the electron transport properties calculated from high-throughput first-principles calculations, the amount of material entries is often limited and those functional properties are often reported in scalar form. Comprehensive databases for the tensorial properties still remain inadequate, which prevents from capturing the anisotropic effect in materials and the development of advanced machine learning models that incorporate the space group symmetry of materials. Therefore, in this work we present the largest-to-date database of tensorial optical properties (optical conductivity, shift current) and the database of tensorial transport properties (electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermoelectric figure of merit zT) for 7301 materials, calculated from the Wannier function method. The quality of the Wannier functions were validated by the maximal spread of the Wannier functions and by the comparison with the band structures from first-principles calculations, ensuring the accuracy of the calculated properties. These results contribute to the systematic study the functional properties for diverse materials and can benefit future data-driven discovery of candidate materials for optoelectronic and thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Cobalt Grown from Co-S Eutectic in High Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Samples of Co were grown directly in the ferromagnetic state under equilibrium conditions using a cobalt sulfide flux. Magnetic fields up to 9 T were applied during growth, and isolated Co products exhibit progressively elongated morphologies, from cubes to rectangular rods to needle-like tendrils with poorly-defined facets. The degree of elongation of the major axis was found to correlate with magnetic field direction, strength, and gradient. Two-dimensional X-ray diffraction data indicate some level of polycrystalline-like samples, and quantitative analyses (Le Bail and Rietveld) of the one-dimensional data confirm the presence of hcp and fcc phases. The magnetic responses indicate a partial alignment of the magnetic easy-axis of the hcp phase along the magnetic field present during growth.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition for Ultrawide Band-Gap MgSiN2 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthorhombic II-IV nitride semiconductors offer an expanded and more tunable material set with unique properties, while maintaining close compatibility with the wurtzite crystal structure of the III-nitrides. In particular, MgSiN2, a II-IV nitride closely lattice matched to GaN and AlN has a band gap suitable for photonic applications in the UV-C wavelength region. MgSiN2 is also a promising candidate to exhibit ferroelectricity, which has only been observed in very few nitride materials. This study builds on our previous work on the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of MgSiN2 thin films grown on GaN-on-sapphire and c-plane sapphire substrates by exploring higher growth temperature windows, resulting in higher crystalline quality and improved interfaces. Correlations between the growth conditions (Mg:Si precursor molar flow rate ratio, reactor pressure, and growth temperatures from 900C to 960C) and the resultant film quality are investigated for films grown on GaN-on-sapphire. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) reveals high-quality orthorhombic single-crystal MgSiN2, confirming successful epitaxial growth on GaN. Optical transmittance measurements indicate the direct band gap is 6.34-6.36 eV and indirect band gap is 5.77-5.81 eV, affirming the realization of an ultrawide-band gap II-IV nitride semiconductor that is structurally compatible with existing III-nitride device platforms.</description>

      <title>Constitutive relations from images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constitutive relations close the balance laws of continuum mechanics and serves as the surrogate for a material in the design and engineering process. The problem of obtaining the constitutive relations is an indirect inverse problem where both the relation and the quantities that define the relation have to be inferred from experimental observations. The advent of full-field observation techniques promises a new ability of learning constitutive relations in realistic operational conditions. However, this is done in two steps, first obtaining deformations from the images, and then obtaining the constitutive relation from deformations and forces. This leads to a variety of difficulties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables us to obtain constitutive relation directly from the raw data consisting of images and force measurements.</description>

      <title>Electron beam precession for a serial crystallography experiment in a TEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the last few years, serial electron crystallography (Serial Electron Diffraction, SerialED) has been gaining attention for the structure determination of crystalline compounds that are sensitive to the irradiation of the electron beam. By recording a single electron diffraction pattern per crystal, indexing hundreds or even thousands of measured particles, and merging the reflection intensities of the successfully indexed patterns, one can retrieve crystal structure models with strongly mitigated beam damage contributions. However, one of the technique's bottlenecks is the need to collect that many diffraction patterns, which, done in an automated way, results in low indexing rates. This work demonstrates how to overcome this limitation by performing the serial crystallography experiment following a semi-automated routine with a precessed electron beam (Serial Precession Electron Diffraction, SerialPED). The precession movement increases the number of reflections present in the diffraction patterns and dynamical effects related to specific orientations of the crystals with respect to the electron beam are smoothed out. This leads to more uniform reflection intensities across the serial dataset and a smaller number of patterns are required to merge the reflection intensities for good statistics. Furthermore, structure refinements based on the dynamical diffraction theory become accessible, providing a novel approach for more accurate structure models. In this context, the use of beam precession is presented as an advantageous tool for serial electron crystallography as it enables reliable crystal structure analysis with a lower amount of diffraction data.</description>

      <title>Many-body \textit{ab initio} study of quasiparticle \&amp; optical excitations and exciton analysis in LiZnAs and ScAgC for photovoltaic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles density-functional theory and many-body excited-state calculations, we study the quasiparticle band structure, optical and excitonic properties of two half-Heusler (HH) compounds, namely LiZnAs and ScAgC, for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Our results reveal a direct bandgap semiconducting behavior in LiZnAs (ScAgC) with a value of 1.5 (1.0) eV under an accurate G$_0$W$_0$ calculation. The highest value of the imaginary part of dielectric function is found as 52 (87), 77 (87), 88 (91) using the independent-quasiparticle approximation, local field effects in random-phase approximation, and electron-hole interaction in the Bethe-Salpeter equation, respectively. Both materials demonstrate a high refractive index, high absorption coefficients (1.2-1.6 $\times 10^6 cm^{-1}$), and low reflectivity (&lt; 40%) in active region of the solar spectrum. The triply degenerate bright excitons (exciton A) at the main absorption peak and a considerable number of bright excitonic states in the visible region, are observed; however, the excitons oscillator strength are comparatively weaker in ScAgC than in LiZnAs. We further discuss the exciton character contributing to intense optical interband transitions and reveal that direct band gap is associated to the loosely bound exciton A state with binding energy of 45 (56) meV in LiZnAs (ScAgC). Exciton A is found to be highly localized (delocalized) in momentum (real) space, indicating the presence of Mott-Wannier type excitons at bandgap. Finally, we assess the solar efficiencies using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) model and find SLME values of 32% for LiZnAs and 31% for ScAgC at a 0.4 $\mu$m thin-film thickness. These findings highlight the significant role of excitons in solar energy absorption process and also suggest that both are highly suitable candidates for single-junction thin-film solar cells.</description>

      <title>Real-space methods for ab initio modelling of surfaces and interfaces under external potential bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate ab initio modelling of surfaces and interfaces, especially under an applied external potential bias, is important for describing and characterizing various phenomena that occur in electronic, catalytic, and energy storage devices. Leveraging the ability of real-space density functional theory (DFT) codes to accommodate generic boundary conditions, we introduce two methods for applying an external potential bias that can be suitable for modelling surfaces and interfaces. In the first method, an external constant electric field is applied by modifying the DFT Hamiltonian via the introduction of an auxiliary linear potential while solving the electrostatic potential arising in DFT using a Poisson equation with zero-Neumann boundary conditions. The second method directly enforces the desired external potential bias by imposing constraints on the electrostatic potential, thereby naturally mimicking experimental conditions. We describe the underlying DFT governing equations for the two setups within the real-space formalism employing finite-element discretization. First, we validate the constant electric field setup within real-space finite-element DFT (DFT-FE) with an equivalent approach using plane-wave DFT (i.e., using periodic boundary conditions) on three representative benchmark systems, namely La-terminated Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$, GaAs (111), and Al FCC (111) slabs. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the two setups in terms of the average ground-state properties, such as surface and adsorption energies. The methods developed in our work provide an attractive alternative to plane-wave DFT approaches in applying external potential bias that usually suffer from the periodic boundary conditions restrictions and poor scalability on parallel computing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin dynamics of a 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg tetramer chain. Employing a combination of Density Matrix Renormalization Group, quantum renormalization group, and perturbation theory techniques, we compute the energy levels and the quantum phase diagram, analyze the phase transitions, and evaluate the $L$ and $K$ -edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectrum of fractionalized and collective (single and multi-particle) excitations. Our calculations suggest that the chain can transition between a hidden $Z_2\times Z_2$ discrete symmetry preserving tetramer phase and a Haldane phase with non-vanishing string order that breaks the hidden symmetry. These two gapped phases are intervened by an intermediate deconfined quantum critical state comprising of free spins and three-site doublets, which is a gapless critical phase with deconfined spinons. We find that the tetramer chain can support fractionalized (spinon) and collective (triplon and quinton) excitations. In the ferromagnetic intra-tetramer limit, the chain can support a quinton excitation which has a five-fold degenerate excited state. String order parameter calculations suggest CuInVO$_5$ to be in a Haldane-like phase whose $L$ -edge RIXS spectrum can support observable triplon and quinton excitations. We also identify possible two-particle excitations (two-singlon, two-triplon, triplon-quinton, and two-quinton excitations) resulting from the double spin-flip effect in the $K$ -edge RIXS spectrum.</description>

      <title>Antiferro octupolar order in the 5d$^1$ double perovskite Sr$_2$MgReO$_6$ and its spectroscopic signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Hidden"-order phases with high-rank multipolar order parameters have been recently detected in several cubic double perovskites of 5$d$ transition metals. Here, by constructing and solving an ab initio low-energy Hamiltonian, we show that an antiferroic order of magnetic octupoles also forms in the tetragonal 5d$^1$ double perovskite Sr$_2$MgReO$_6$. The low-temperature order in this material is determined by a tetragonal crystal field dominating over exchange interactions. This results in a well isolated crystal-field doublet ground state hosting octupolar low-energy degrees of freedom. Very weak dipole moments entangled with the primary octupole order parameters are induced by admixture of the excited $j1/2$ spin-orbit multiplet. We show that the octupolar order leads to characteristic quasi-gapless magnetic excitation spectra as well as to the intensity of superstructural neutron diffraction reflexes peaking at large scattering momenta.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Generation of Higher-order Spin-Orbit Couplings, Topology and Persistent Spin Texture in Light-Irradiated Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have been identified as the third category of magnetic materials, exhibiting momentum-dependent spin splitting characterized by even powers of momentum. In this study, we show that when subjected to elliptically polarized light, these materials serve as an exemplary framework for the dynamic generation of topological bands featuring higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Notably, while the generated Zeeman field remains invariant to the particular altermagnetic ordering, the induced higher-order SOCs are related to the magnitude and symmetry of the altermagnetic order. Specifically, we show that an altermagnet exhibiting $k^n$-spin splitting can generate spin-orbit couplings up to $k^{n-1}$. In the limit of circularly polarized light, the only correction is $k^{n-1}$, with all lower-order contributions being nullified. Interestingly, light-induced SOCs significantly impact the low-energy band topology, where their Chern numbers change by $\Delta C =\pm 1,2,3$ for $d,g,f$-wave altermagnets. Finally, we find a critical field in which a persistent spin texture is realized, a highly desirable state with predicted infinite spin lifetime. Our work showcases light as a powerful, controllable tool for engineering complex and exciting phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>A machine learning platform for development of low flammability polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flammability index (FI) and cone calorimetry outcomes, such as maximum heat release rate, time to ignition, total smoke release, and fire growth rate, are critical factors in evaluating the fire safety of polymers. However, predicting these properties is challenging due to the complexity of material behavior under heat exposure. In this work, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict these flammability metrics. We generated synthetic polymers using Synthetic Data Vault to augment the experimental dataset. Our comprehensive ML investigation employed both our polymer descriptors and those generated by the RDkit library. Despite the challenges of limited experimental data, our models demonstrate the potential to accurately predict FI and cone calorimetry outcomes, which could be instrumental in designing safer polymers. Additionally, we developed POLYCOMPRED, a module integrated into the cloud-based MatVerse platform, providing an accessible, web-based interface for flammability prediction. This work provides not only the predictive modeling of polymer flammability but also an interactive analysis tool for the discovery and design of new materials with tailored fire-resistant properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum computation of a quasiparticle band structure with the quantum-selected configuration interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle band structures are fundamental for understanding strongly correlated electron systems. While solving these structures accurately on classical computers is challenging, quantum computing offers a promising alternative. Specifically, the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) method, combined with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), provides a quantum algorithm for calculating quasiparticle band structures. However, optimizing the variational parameters in VQE becomes increasingly difficult as the system size grows, due to device noise, statistical noise, and the barren plateau problem. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid approach that combines QSE with the quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method for calculating quasiparticle band structures. QSCI may leverage the VQE ansatz as an input state but, unlike the standard VQE, it does not require full optimization of the variational parameters, making it more scalable for larger quantum systems. Based on this approach, we demonstrate the quantum computation of the quasiparticle band structure of a silicon using 16 qubits on an IBM quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Chemical Pressure Tuning of Multipolar and Magnetic Orders in Ba$_2$(Cd$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$)ReO$_6$ Double Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double perovskite compounds containing 5d transition metal elements have been extensively studied as platforms for multipolar order phenomena stemming from spin-orbit-entangled 5d electrons. In this study, we examine the interplay between crystal structure, multipolar order, and magnetic order in solid solutions of double perovskites with the 5d1 electronic configuration: Ba2CdReO6 and Ba2CaReO6, which exhibit distinct electronic orders. The substitution of larger Ca2+ ions for Cd2+ in Ba2CdReO6, systematically increases the lattice constant with increasing the amount of substitution x. Although the spin-orbit-entangled J = 3/2 state remains intact upon substitution, both the quadrupolar order below Tq = 25 K and the canted antiferro-magnetic (AFM) order below Tm = 12 K in Ba2CdReO6 are progressively suppressed as x increases. Magnetization measurements reveal that the canted AFM order is suppressed at x = 0.6, transitioning to a colinear AFM order, while the quadrupolar order persists up to x = 0.9. The experimental electronic phase diagram, summarizing the dependence of electronic orders on lattice constants, aligns well with the theoretical phase diagram considering electric quadrupolar interactions [G. Chen et al., Phys. Rev. B 82, 174440 (2010)]. This correspondence confirms that chemical pressure induced by substitution effectively tunes the interaction between 5d electrons. The results highlight the potential of chemical pressure to modulate multipolar interactions, paving the way for novel multipolar properties in 5d electron systems.</description>

      <title>Light-driven modulation of proximity-enhanced functionalities in hybrid nano-scale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing quantum information and communication technology (qICT) requires smaller and faster components with actively controllable functionalities. This work presents a novel strategy for dynamically modulating magnetic properties via proximity effects controlled by light. We demonstrate this concept using hybrid nanoscale systems composed of C60 molecules proximitized to a cobalt metallic ferromagnetic surface, where proximity interactions are particularly strong. Our findings show that by inducing excitons in the C60 molecules with resonant ultrashort light pulses, we can significantly modify the interaction at the cobalt/C60 interface, leading to a striking 60% transient shift in the frequency of the dipolar ferromagnetic resonance mode of the Cobalt. This effect, detected via a specifically designed time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (tr-MOKE) experiment, persists on a timescale of hundreds of picoseconds. Since this frequency shift directly correlates with a transient change in the anisotropy field (an essential parameter for technological applications) our findings establish a new paradigm for ultrafast optical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Efficient spin filtering through Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing ab initio simulations, we study the spin-dependent electronic transport characteristics within Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures. The electronic density of states for both free-standing and device-configured Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ (F4GT) confirms its ferromagnetic metallic nature and reveals a weak interface interaction between F4GT and PtTe$_2$ electrodes, enabling efficient spin filtering. We observe a decrease in the magnetic anisotropy energy of F4GT in the device configuration, indicating reduced stability of magnetic moments and heightened sensitivity to external conditions. The transmission eigenstates of PtTe$_2$/ monolayer F4GT/PtTe$_2$ heterostructures demonstrate interference patterns affected by relative phases and localization, notably different in the spin-up and spin-down channels. The ballistic transport through a double-layer F4GT with a ferromagnetic configuration sandwiched between two PtTe$_2$ electrodes is predicted to exhibit an impressive spin polarization of 97$\%$ with spin-up electrons exhibiting higher transmission probability than spin-down electrons. Moreover, we investigate the spin transport properties of Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$/GaTe/Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures sandwiched between PtTe$_2$ electrodes to explore their potential as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in spintronic devices. The inclusion of GaTe as a 2D semiconducting spacer between F4GT layers results in a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 487$\%$ at low bias and decreases with increasing bias voltage. In general, our findings underscore the potential of F4GT / GaTe / F4GT heterostructures to advance spintronic devices based on van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Twisting Light, Steering Spins: Gold Nanoparticle Magnetization via Inverse Faraday and Orbital Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to controlling magnetization in gold nanoparticles using the Inverse Faraday Effect combined with Laguerre-Gauss beams carrying orbital angular momentum. By tailoring the tilt of isophase planes, we induce drift photocurrents that generate magnetic fields tilted by up to 25{\deg} relative to the beam axis. The magnetic orientation can be reversed by switching polarization chirality or the orbital angular momentum sign, and it can be rotated azimuthally by repositioning the particle, accessing any angle over 2{\pi} steradians. This unprecedented level of control extends all-optical magnetization to three-dimensional orientations, potentially at ultrafast timescales given the near-instantaneous nature of the Inverse Faraday Effect. Our results pave the way for advanced spin-based applications, from triggering spin waves in magnetic materials to designing next-generation magnetic memory and logic devices.</description>

Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force fields (MLFF) in solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to simulate liquid electrolyte, a critical component of the current commercial lithium-ion battery. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (\textbf{B}yteDance \textbf{A}I \textbf{M}olecular Simulation \textbf{Boo}ster), a predictive framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capability in the context of liquid electrolyte for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it to MLFFs to reduce the fluctuation of observations from MD simulations. Finally, we propose a density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. The current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experiment.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice couplings in $3d$ ferromagnets: analysis from first-principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoelasticity plays a crucial role in numerous magnetic phenomena, including magnetocalorics, magnon excitation via acoustic waves, and ultrafast demagnetization/Einstein-de Haas effect. Despite a long-standing discussion on anisotropy-mediated magnetoelastic interactions of relativistic origin, the exchange-mediated magnetoelastic parameters within an atomistic framework have only recently begun to be investigated. As a result, many of their behaviors and values for real materials remain poorly understood. Therefore, by using a proposed simple modification of the embedded cluster approach that reduces the computational complexity, we critically analyze the properties of exchange-mediated spin-lattice coupling parameters for elemental $3d$ ferromagnets (bcc Fe, fcc Ni, and fcc Co), comparing methods used for their extraction and relating their realistic values to symmetry considerations and orbitally-decomposed contributions. Additionally, we investigate the effects of noncollinearity (spin temperature) and applied pressure on these parameters. For Fe, we find that single-site rotations, associated with spin temperatures around $\sim100$ K, induce significant modifications, particularly in Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-type couplings; in contrast, such interactions in Co and Ni remain almost configuration independent. Moreover, we demonstrate a notable change in the exchange-mediated magnetoelastic constants for Fe under isotropic contraction. Finally, the conversion between atomistic, quantum-mechanically derived parameters and the phenomenological magnetoelastic theory is discussed, which can be an useful tool towards larger and more realistic dynamics simulations involving coupled subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a molecular dynamics study of ab initio quality of the ferroelectric phase transition in crystalline PbTiO3. We model anharmonicity accurately in terms of potential energy and polarization surfaces trained on density functional theory data with modern machine learning techniques. Our simulations demonstrate that the transition has a strong order-disorder character, in agreement with diffraction experiments, and provide fresh insight into the approach to equilibrium across the phase transition. We find that the emergence and disappearance of the macroscopic polarization is driven by dipolar switching at the nanometer scale. We also computed the infrared optical absorption spectra in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases, finding good agreement with the experimental Raman frequencies. Often, the almost ideal displacive character of the soft mode detected by Raman scattering in the paraelectric phase has been contrasted with the order-disorder character of the transition suggested by diffraction experiments. We settle this issue by showing that the soft mode coexists with a strong Debye relaxation associated with thermal disordering of the dipoles. The Debye relaxation feature is centered at zero frequency and appears near the transition temperature in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases.</description>

      <title>Electronic density of states as the descriptor of elastic bond strength, ductility, and local lattice distortion in BCC refractory alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although electronic density of states (DOS) is fundamental to materials properties, its general relationship to mechanical properties of alloys is not well established. In this paper, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the electronic occupancy at the Fermi level, N(Ef), obtained from DOS is a key descriptor of alloy strength and ductility. Our comprehensive analysis of numerous body centered cubic (BCC) refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) shows an overwhelming correlation that low N(Ef) indicates strong bonds that have high stiffness resulting in high elastic constants. High bond stiffness indicates presence of covalent nature of bonds that are directional in nature resulting in resistance to deformation leading to high bulk (B) and shear (G) moduli. Consequently, N(Ef) provides a direct correlation to the tendency of alloy ductility evidenced in the Pugh ratio (G/B). As stiffer bonds result in lower local lattice distortion (LLD), N(Ef) are LLD are also found to be corelated which opens up a correlation to solid solution strengthening and yield strength. Thus, this work unveils fundamental correlations between N(Ef) and (1) elastic bond strength, (2) ductility, and (3) LLD. These correlations open opportunities for the design of high strength high ductile RHEAs.</description>

      <title>Shear Strain-Induced Multiferroic Response in the Altermagnetic Semiconductor CuFeS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CuFeS$_2$ is an altermagnetic semiconductor that is lattice-matched with silicon and has a high N\'eel temperature. It is nonpolar and magnetically compensated in its structural ground state. However, the crystal belongs to a magnetic symmetry class allowing simultaneous piezoelectricity and -magnetism, indicating that distortion by shear strain may enable functional properties not observed in its tetragonal ground state. This first-principles study explores how biaxial and shear strain affect the crystal structure and functional properties. Biaxial strain lowers crystal symmetry when applied to two of the three crystallographic {001} planes considered, enhancing the altermagnetic lifting of the Kramers degeneracy. Shear strain has a compressive effect on the crystal, enhancing the effects on the electronic structure seen under biaxial compressive strain. Applying it to any one of the three {001} planes induces a polar phase with an out-of-plane electric polarization, perpendicular to the strained plane. Moreover, applying shear strain to two out of the three {001} planes induces a net magnetization simultaneously with electric polarization, producing a multiferroic response.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric control of spin helicity and nonreciprocal charge transport in a multiferroic metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multiferroic state with both electric polarization ($P$) and magnetization ($M$) shows the inherently strong $P$-$M$ coupling, when $P$ is induced by cycloidal (N\'eel-wall like) spin modulation. The sign of $P$ is determined by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, we report the current-induced magnetoelectric control of the multiferroics in a helimagnetic metal YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment $T \sim P \times M \sim (\hat{q} \times \chi_v) \times M$ as well as with the magneto-chirality $\chi_v \times M$, where $\hat{q}$ and $\chi_v$ being the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. We furthermore observe an enhancement of NRR by the spin-cluster scattering via $\chi_v$ and its fluctuation. These findings may pave a way to exploration of multiferroic conductors and application of the spin-helicity degree of freedom as a state-variable.</description>

Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>
