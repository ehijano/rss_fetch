      <title>The VoiceMOS Challenge 2024: Beyond Speech Quality Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the third edition of the VoiceMOS Challenge, a scientific initiative designed to advance research into automatic prediction of human speech ratings. There were three tracks. The first track was on predicting the quality of ``zoomed-in'' high-quality samples from speech synthesis systems. The second track was to predict ratings of samples from singing voice synthesis and voice conversion with a large variety of systems, listeners, and languages. The third track was semi-supervised quality prediction for noisy, clean, and enhanced speech, where a very small amount of labeled training data was provided. Among the eight teams from both academia and industry, we found that many were able to outperform the baseline systems. Successful techniques included retrieval-based methods and the use of non-self-supervised representations like spectrograms and pitch histograms. These results showed that the challenge has advanced the field of subjective speech rating prediction.</description>

      <title>Improving Anomalous Sound Detection via Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-Tuning of Pre-Trained Audio Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) has gained significant interest through the application of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in industrial settings. Though possessing great potential, ASD systems can hardly be readily deployed in real production sites due to the generalization problem, which is primarily caused by the difficulty of data collection and the complexity of environmental factors. This paper introduces a robust ASD model that leverages audio pre-trained models. Specifically, we fine-tune these models using machine operation data, employing SpecAug as a data augmentation strategy. Additionally, we investigate the impact of utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) tuning instead of full fine-tuning to address the problem of limited data for fine-tuning. Our experiments on the DCASE2023 Task 2 dataset establish a new benchmark of 77.75% on the evaluation set, with a significant improvement of 6.48% compared with previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, including top-tier traditional convolutional networks and speech pre-trained models, which demonstrates the effectiveness of audio pre-trained models with LoRA tuning. Ablation studies are also conducted to showcase the efficacy of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Developing a Framework for Sonifying Variational Quantum Algorithms: Implications for Music Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter examines the Variational Quantum Harmonizer, a software tool and musical interface that focuses on the problem of sonification of the minimization steps of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA), used for simulating properties of quantum systems and optimization problems assisted by quantum hardware. Particularly, it details the sonification of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems using VQA. A flexible design enables its future applications both as a sonification tool for auditory displays in scientific investigation, and as a hybrid quantum-digital musical instrument for artistic endeavours. In turn, sonification can help researchers understand complex systems better and can serve for the training of quantum physics and quantum computing. The VQH structure, including its software implementation, control mechanisms, and sonification mappings are detailed. Moreover, it guides the design of QUBO cost functions in VQH as a music compositional object. The discussion is extended to the implications of applying quantum-assisted simulation in quantum-computer aided composition and live-coding performances. An artistic output is showcased by the piece \textit{Hexagonal Chambers} (Thomas and Itabora\'i, 2023).</description>

      <title>Linear Time Complexity Conformers with SummaryMixing for Streaming Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) with an encoder equipped with self-attention, whether streaming or non-streaming, takes quadratic time in the length of the speech utterance. This slows down training and decoding, increase their cost, and limit the deployment of the ASR in constrained devices. SummaryMixing is a promising linear-time complexity alternative to self-attention for non-streaming speech recognition that, for the first time, preserves or outperforms the accuracy of self-attention models. Unfortunately, the original definition of SummaryMixing is not suited to streaming speech recognition. Hence, this work extends SummaryMixing to a Conformer Transducer that works in both a streaming and an offline mode. It shows that this new linear-time complexity speech encoder outperforms self-attention in both scenarios while requiring less compute and memory during training and decoding.</description>

      <title>Analytic Class Incremental Learning for Sound Source Localization with Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound Source Localization (SSL) enabling technology for applications such as surveillance and robotics. While traditional Signal Processing (SP)-based SSL methods provide analytic solutions under specific signal and noise assumptions, recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods have significantly outperformed them. However, their success depends on extensive training data and substantial computational resources. Moreover, they often rely on large-scale annotated spatial data and may struggle when adapting to evolving sound classes. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel Class Incremental Learning (CIL) approach, termed SSL-CIL, which avoids serious accuracy degradation due to catastrophic forgetting by incrementally updating the DL-based SSL model through a closed-form analytic solution. In particular, data privacy is ensured since the learning process does not revisit any historical data (exemplar-free), which is more suitable for smart home scenarios. Empirical results in the public SSLR dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposal, achieving a localization accuracy of 90.9%, surpassing other competitive methods.</description>

      <title>ManaTTS Persian: a recipe for creating TTS datasets for lower resource languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce ManaTTS, the most extensive publicly accessible single-speaker Persian corpus, and a comprehensive framework for collecting transcribed speech datasets for the Persian language. ManaTTS, released under the open CC-0 license, comprises approximately 86 hours of audio with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. Alongside ManaTTS, we also generated the VirgoolInformal dataset to evaluate Persian speech recognition models used for forced alignment, extending over 5 hours of audio. The datasets are supported by a fully transparent, MIT-licensed pipeline, a testament to innovation in the field. It includes unique tools for sentence tokenization, bounded audio segmentation, and a novel forced alignment method. This alignment technique is specifically designed for low-resource languages, addressing a crucial need in the field. With this dataset, we trained a Tacotron2-based TTS model, achieving a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 3.76, which is remarkably close to the MOS of 3.86 for the utterances generated by the same vocoder and natural spectrogram, and the MOS of 4.01 for the natural waveform, demonstrating the exceptional quality and effectiveness of the corpus.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dialect Text-To-Speech in Pitch-Accent Language Incorporating Multi-Dialect Phoneme-Level BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore cross-dialect text-to-speech (CD-TTS), a task to synthesize learned speakers' voices in non-native dialects, especially in pitch-accent languages. CD-TTS is important for developing voice agents that naturally communicate with people across regions. We present a novel TTS model comprising three sub-modules to perform competitively at this task. We first train a backbone TTS model to synthesize dialect speech from a text conditioned on phoneme-level accent latent variables (ALVs) extracted from speech by a reference encoder. Then, we train an ALV predictor to predict ALVs tailored to a target dialect from input text leveraging our novel multi-dialect phoneme-level BERT. We conduct multi-dialect TTS experiments and evaluate the effectiveness of our model by comparing it with a baseline derived from conventional dialect TTS methods. The results show that our model improves the dialectal naturalness of synthetic speech in CD-TTS.</description>

      <title>A Suite for Acoustic Language Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech language models have recently demonstrated great potential as universal speech processing systems. Such models have the ability to model the rich acoustic information existing in audio signals, beyond spoken content, such as emotion, background noise, etc. Despite this, evaluation benchmarks which evaluate awareness to a wide range of acoustic aspects, are lacking. To help bridge this gap, we introduce SALMon, a novel evaluation suite encompassing background noise, emotion, speaker identity and room impulse response. The proposed benchmarks both evaluate the consistency of the inspected element and how much it matches the spoken text. We follow a modelling based approach, measuring whether a model gives correct samples higher scores than incorrect ones. This approach makes the benchmark fast to compute even for large models. We evaluated several speech language models on SALMon, thus highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each evaluated method. Code and data are publicly available at https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/salmon/ .</description>

      <title>Unveiling Visual Biases in Audio-Visual Localization Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Source Localization (AVSL) aims to localize the source of sound within a video. In this paper, we identify a significant issue in existing benchmarks: the sounding objects are often easily recognized based solely on visual cues, which we refer to as visual bias. Such biases hinder these benchmarks from effectively evaluating AVSL models. To further validate our hypothesis regarding visual biases, we examine two representative AVSL benchmarks, VGG-SS and EpicSounding-Object, where the vision-only models outperform all audiovisual baselines. Our findings suggest that existing AVSL benchmarks need further refinement to facilitate audio-visual learning.</description>

      <title>Enhancing CTC-Based Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents LiteVSR2, an enhanced version of our previously introduced efficient approach to Visual Speech Recognition (VSR). Building upon our knowledge distillation framework from a pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model, we introduce two key improvements: a stabilized video preprocessing technique and feature normalization in the distillation process. These improvements yield substantial performance gains on the LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks, positioning LiteVSR2 as the current best CTC-based VSR model without increasing the volume of training data or computational resources utilized. Furthermore, we explore the scalability of our approach by examining performance metrics across varying model complexities and training data volumes. LiteVSR2 maintains the efficiency of its predecessor while significantly enhancing accuracy, thereby demonstrating the potential for resource-efficient advancements in VSR technology.</description>

      <title>D-CAPTCHA++: A Study of Resilience of Deepfake CAPTCHA under Transferable Imperceptible Adversarial Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancements in generative AI have enabled the improvement of audio synthesis models, including text-to-speech and voice conversion. This raises concerns about its potential misuse in social manipulation and political interference, as synthetic speech has become indistinguishable from natural human speech. Several speech-generation programs are utilized for malicious purposes, especially impersonating individuals through phone calls. Therefore, detecting fake audio is crucial to maintain social security and safeguard the integrity of information. Recent research has proposed a D-CAPTCHA system based on the challenge-response protocol to differentiate fake phone calls from real ones. In this work, we study the resilience of this system and introduce a more robust version, D-CAPTCHA++, to defend against fake calls. Specifically, we first expose the vulnerability of the D-CAPTCHA system under transferable imperceptible adversarial attack. Secondly, we mitigate such vulnerability by improving the robustness of the system by using adversarial training in D-CAPTCHA deepfake detectors and task classifiers.</description>

      <title>VMAS: Video-to-Music Generation via Semantic Alignment in Web Music Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for learning to generate background music from video inputs. Unlike existing works that rely on symbolic musical annotations, which are limited in quantity and diversity, our method leverages large-scale web videos accompanied by background music. This enables our model to learn to generate realistic and diverse music. To accomplish this goal, we develop a generative video-music Transformer with a novel semantic video-music alignment scheme. Our model uses a joint autoregressive and contrastive learning objective, which encourages the generation of music aligned with high-level video content. We also introduce a novel video-beat alignment scheme to match the generated music beats with the low-level motions in the video. Lastly, to capture fine-grained visual cues in a video needed for realistic background music generation, we introduce a new temporal video encoder architecture, allowing us to efficiently process videos consisting of many densely sampled frames. We train our framework on our newly curated DISCO-MV dataset, consisting of 2.2M video-music samples, which is orders of magnitude larger than any prior datasets used for video music generation. Our method outperforms existing approaches on the DISCO-MV and MusicCaps datasets according to various music generation evaluation metrics, including human evaluation.

      <title>EventTrojan: Manipulating Non-Intrusive Speech Quality Assessment via Imperceptible Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Intrusive speech quality assessment (NISQA) has gained significant attention for predicting speech's mean opinion score (MOS) without requiring the reference speech. Researchers have gradually started to apply NISQA to various practical scenarios. However, little attention has been paid to the security of NISQA models. Backdoor attacks represent the most serious threat to deep neural networks (DNNs) due to the fact that backdoors possess a very high attack success rate once embedded. However, existing backdoor attacks assume that the attacker actively feeds samples containing triggers into the model during the inference phase. This is not adapted to the specific scenario of NISQA. And current backdoor attacks on regression tasks lack an objective metric to measure the attack performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel backdoor triggering approach (EventTrojan) that utilizes an event during the usage of the NISQA model as a trigger. Moreover, we innovatively provide an objective metric for backdoor attacks on regression tasks. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the EventTrojan attack. Besides, it also has good resistance to several defense methods.</description>

      <title>COCOLA: Coherence-Oriented Contrastive Learning of Musical Audio Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present COCOLA (Coherence-Oriented Contrastive Learning for Audio), a contrastive learning method for musical audio representations that captures the harmonic and rhythmic coherence between samples. Our method operates at the level of the stems composing music tracks and can input features obtained via Harmonic-Percussive Separation (HPS). COCOLA allows the objective evaluation of generative models for music accompaniment generation, which are difficult to benchmark with established metrics. In this regard, we evaluate recent music accompaniment generation models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. We release the model checkpoints trained on public datasets containing separate stems (MUSDB18-HQ, MoisesDB, Slakh2100, and CocoChorales).</description>

      <title>Sim2Real Transfer for Audio-Visual Navigation with Frequency-Adaptive Acoustic Field Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sim2real transfer has received increasing attention lately due to the success of learning robotic tasks in simulation end-to-end. While there has been a lot of progress in transferring vision-based navigation policies, the existing sim2real strategy for audio-visual navigation performs data augmentation empirically without measuring the acoustic gap. The sound differs from light in that it spans across much wider frequencies and thus requires a different solution for sim2real. We propose the first treatment of sim2real for audio-visual navigation by disentangling it into acoustic field prediction (AFP) and waypoint navigation. We first validate our design choice in the SoundSpaces simulator and show improvement on the Continuous AudioGoal navigation benchmark. We then collect real-world data to measure the spectral difference between the simulation and the real world by training AFP models that only take a specific frequency subband as input. We further propose a frequency-adaptive strategy that intelligently selects the best frequency band for prediction based on both the measured spectral difference and the energy distribution of the received audio, which improves the performance on the real data. Lastly, we build a real robot platform and show that the transferred policy can successfully navigate to sounding objects. This work demonstrates the potential of building intelligent agents that can see, hear, and act entirely from simulation, and transferring them to the real world.</description>

      <title>Naturalistic Music Decoding from EEG Data via Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09062v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the potential of using latent diffusion models, a family of powerful generative models, for the task of reconstructing naturalistic music from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Unlike simpler music with limited timbres, such as MIDI-generated tunes or monophonic pieces, the focus here is on intricate music featuring a diverse array of instruments, voices, and effects, rich in harmonics and timbre. This study represents an initial foray into achieving general music reconstruction of high-quality using non-invasive EEG data, employing an end-to-end training approach directly on raw data without the need for manual pre-processing and channel selection. We train our models on the public NMED-T dataset and perform quantitative evaluation proposing neural embedding-based metrics. Our work contributes to the ongoing research in neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces, offering insights into the feasibility of using EEG data for complex auditory information reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Serialized Speech Information Guidance with Overlapped Encoding Separation for Multi-Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serialized output training (SOT) attracts increasing attention due to its convenience and flexibility for multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, it is not easy to train with attention loss only. In this paper, we propose the overlapped encoding separation (EncSep) to fully utilize the benefits of the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention hybrid loss. This additional separator is inserted after the encoder to extract the multi-speaker information with CTC losses. Furthermore, we propose the serialized speech information guidance SOT (GEncSep) to further utilize the separated encodings. The separated streams are concatenated to provide single-speaker information to guide attention during decoding. The experimental results on LibriMix show that the single-speaker encoding can be separated from the overlapped encoding. The CTC loss helps to improve the encoder representation under complex scenarios. GEncSep further improved performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of real-time transcriptions using end-to-end ASR models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Speech-to-text (STT) has greatly evolved in the last few years. Traditional architectures based on pipelines have been replaced by joint end-to-end (E2E) architectures that simplify and streamline the model training process. In addition, new AI training methods, such as weak-supervised learning have reduced the need for high-quality audio datasets for model training. However, despite all these advancements, little to no research has been done on real-time transcription. In real-time scenarios, the audio is not pre-recorded, and the input audio must be fragmented to be processed by the ASR systems. To achieve real-time requirements, these fragments must be as short as possible to reduce latency. However, audio cannot be split at any point as dividing an utterance into two separate fragments will generate an incorrect transcription. Also, shorter fragments provide less context for the ASR model. For this reason, it is necessary to design and test different splitting algorithms to optimize the quality and delay of the resulting transcription. In this paper, three audio splitting algorithms are evaluated with different ASR models to determine their impact on both the quality of the transcription and the end-to-end delay. The algorithms are fragmentation at fixed intervals, voice activity detection (VAD), and fragmentation with feedback. The results are compared to the performance of the same model, without audio fragmentation, to determine the effects of this division. The results show that VAD fragmentation provides the best quality with the highest delay, whereas fragmentation at fixed intervals provides the lowest quality and the lowest delay. The newly proposed feedback algorithm exchanges a 2-4% increase in WER for a reduction of 1.5-2s delay, respectively, to the VAD splitting.</description>

      <title>MTDA-HSED: Mutual-Assistance Tuning and Dual-Branch Aggregating for Heterogeneous Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sound Event Detection (SED) plays a vital role in comprehending and perceiving acoustic scenes. Previous methods have demonstrated impressive capabilities. However, they are deficient in learning features of complex scenes from heterogeneous dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel dual-branch architecture named Mutual-Assistance Tuning and Dual-Branch Aggregating for Heterogeneous Sound Event Detection (MTDA-HSED). The MTDA-HSED architecture employs the Mutual-Assistance Audio Adapter (M3A) to effectively tackle the multi-scenario problem and uses the Dual-Branch Mid-Fusion (DBMF) module to tackle the multi-granularity problem. Specifically, M3A is integrated into the BEATs block as an adapter to improve the BEATs' performance by fine-tuning it on the multi-scenario dataset. The DBMF module connects BEATs and CNN branches, which facilitates the deep fusion of information from the BEATs and the CNN branches. Experimental results show that the proposed methods exceed the baseline of mpAUC by \textbf{$5\%$} on the DESED and MAESTRO Real datasets.

      <title>Period Singer: Integrating Periodic and Aperiodic Variational Autoencoders for Natural-Sounding End-to-End Singing Voice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Period Singer, a novel end-to-end singing voice synthesis (SVS) model that utilizes variational inference for periodic and aperiodic components, aimed at producing natural-sounding waveforms. Recent end-to-end SVS models have demonstrated the capability of synthesizing high-fidelity singing voices. However, owing to deterministic pitch conditioning, they do not fully address the one-to-many problem. To address this problem, we present the Period Singer architecture, which integrates variational autoencoders for the periodic and aperiodic components. Additionally, our methodology eliminates the dependency on an external aligner by estimating the phoneme alignment through a monotonic alignment search within note boundaries. Our empirical evaluations show that Period Singer outperforms existing end-to-end SVS models on Mandarin and Korean datasets. The efficacy of the proposed method was further corroborated by ablation studies.</description>

      <title>TinyChirp: Bird Song Recognition Using TinyML Models on Low-power Wireless Acoustic Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring biodiversity at scale is challenging. Detecting and identifying species in fine grained taxonomies requires highly accurate machine learning (ML) methods. Training such models requires large high quality data sets. And deploying these models to low power devices requires novel compression techniques and model architectures. While species classification methods have profited from novel data sets and advances in ML methods, in particular neural networks, deploying these state of the art models to low power devices remains difficult. Here we present a comprehensive empirical comparison of various tinyML neural network architectures and compression techniques for species classification. We focus on the example of bird song detection, more concretely a data set curated for studying the corn bunting bird species. The data set is released along with all code and experiments of this study. In our experiments we compare predictive performance, memory and time complexity of classical spectrogram based methods and recent approaches operating on raw audio signal. Our results indicate that individual bird species can be robustly detected with relatively simple architectures that can be readily deployed to low power devices.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-fine Alignment Makes Better Speech-image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for speech-image retrieval. We utilize speech-image contrastive (SIC) learning tasks to align speech and image representations at a coarse level and speech-image matching (SIM) learning tasks to further refine the fine-grained cross-modal alignment. SIC and SIM learning tasks are jointly trained in a unified manner. To optimize the learning process, we utilize an embedding queue that facilitates efficient sampling of high-quality and diverse negative representations during SIC learning. Additionally, it enhances the learning of SIM tasks by effectively mining hard negatives based on contrastive similarities calculated in SIC tasks. To further optimize learning under noisy supervision, we incorporate momentum distillation into the training process. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 4% in R@1 on two benchmark datasets for the speech-image retrieval tasks. Moreover, as observed in zero-shot experiments, our framework demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Denoising: A Novel Training Paradigm for Enhancing Speech-Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of speech-image retrieval relies on establishing an effective alignment between speech and image. Existing methods often model cross-modal interaction through simple cosine similarity of the global feature of each modality, which fall short in capturing fine-grained details within modalities. To address this issue, we introduce an effective framework and a novel learning task named cross-modal denoising (CMD) to enhance cross-modal interaction to achieve finer-level cross-modal alignment. Specifically, CMD is a denoising task designed to reconstruct semantic features from noisy features within one modality by interacting features from another modality. Notably, CMD operates exclusively during model training and can be removed during inference without adding extra inference time. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 2.0% in mean R@1 on the Flickr8k dataset and by 1.7% in mean R@1 on the SpokenCOCO dataset for the speech-image retrieval tasks, respectively. These experimental results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>DCIM-AVSR : Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Dual Conformer Interaction Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech recognition is the technology that enables machines to interpret and process human speech, converting spoken language into text or commands. This technology is essential for applications such as virtual assistants, transcription services, and communication tools. The Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) model enhances traditional speech recognition, particularly in noisy environments, by incorporating visual modalities like lip movements and facial expressions. While traditional AVSR models trained on large-scale datasets with numerous parameters can achieve remarkable accuracy, often surpassing human performance, they also come with high training costs and deployment challenges. To address these issues, we introduce an efficient AVSR model that reduces the number of parameters through the integration of a Dual Conformer Interaction Module (DCIM). In addition, we propose a pre-training method that further optimizes model performance by selectively updating parameters, leading to significant improvements in efficiency. Unlike conventional models that require the system to independently learn the hierarchical relationship between audio and visual modalities, our approach incorporates this distinction directly into the model architecture. This design enhances both efficiency and performance, resulting in a more practical and effective solution for AVSR tasks.</description>

      <title>vec2wav 2.0: Advancing Voice Conversion via Discrete Token Vocoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new speech discrete token vocoder, vec2wav 2.0, which advances voice conversion (VC). We use discrete tokens from speech self-supervised models as the content features of source speech, and treat VC as a prompted vocoding task. To amend the loss of speaker timbre in the content tokens, vec2wav 2.0 utilizes the WavLM features to provide strong timbre-dependent information. A novel adaptive Snake activation function is proposed to better incorporate timbre into the waveform reconstruction process. In this way, vec2wav 2.0 learns to alter the speaker timbre appropriately given different reference prompts. Also, no supervised data is required for vec2wav 2.0 to be effectively trained. Experimental results demonstrate that vec2wav 2.0 outperforms all other baselines to a considerable margin in terms of audio quality and speaker similarity in any-to-any VC. Ablation studies verify the effects made by the proposed techniques. Moreover, vec2wav 2.0 achieves competitive cross-lingual VC even only trained on monolingual corpus. Thus, vec2wav 2.0 shows timbre can potentially be manipulated only by speech token vocoders, pushing the frontiers of VC and speech synthesis.</description>
