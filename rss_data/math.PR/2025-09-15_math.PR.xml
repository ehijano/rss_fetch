      <title>Asymptotics of Jack measures with homogeneous specializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Jack measures on partitions with homogeneous defining specializations. For each of the six distinct classes of measures obtained this way we prove a global law of large numbers with an explicit limiting particle density. We also demonstrate for one of these classes how to obtain a global central limit theorem, global and edge large deviation principles, and edge universality using the results of the paper. Our argument is based on explicitly evaluating Jack symmetric functions at homogeneous specializations, relating the Jack measures to the discrete $\beta$-ensembles from (Publications math{\' e}matiques de l'IH{\' E}S 125, 1-78, 2017) and using the discrete loop equations to substantially reduce computations.</description>

      <title>On the fully analytical cumulative distribution of product of correlated Gaussian random Variables with zero means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a fully analytical, one-line closed-form expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the product of two correlated zero-mean normal random variables, avoiding any series representation. This result complements the well-known compact density formula with an equally compact and computationally practical CDF representation. Our main formula expresses the CDF in terms of Humbert's confluent hypergeometric function $\Phi_1$ and modified Bessel functions $K_\nu$, offering both theoretical elegance and computational efficiency. High-precision numerical experiments confirm pointwise agreement with Monte Carlo simulations and other benchmarks to machine accuracy. The resulting representation provides a tractable tool for applications in wireless fading channel modeling, nonlinear signal processing, statistics, finance, and applied probability.</description>

      <title>On the threshold for triangulations inside convex polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Start with a large convex polygon and add all other edges inside independently with probability $p$. At what critical threshold $p_c$ do triangulations of the polygon begin to appear?
  The first author and Gravner asked this question, and observed that $p_c=\Theta(1)$, using the relationship with the Catalan numbers and a coupling with oriented site percolation on ${\mathbb Z}^2$. More recently, Archer, Hartarsky, the first author, Olesker-Taylor, Schapira and Valesin proved that $1/4&lt;p_c&lt;p_c^o$, where $1/4$ is the Catalan exponential growth rate and $p_c^o$ is the critical threshold for oriented percolation. The upper bound is strict, but non-quantitative, and follows by a renormalization argument.
  We show that $p_c&lt;1/2$ using a simple ear clipping algorithm, which can be analyzed using the gambler's ruin problem. This bound is closer to the truth (perhaps near $0.4$) and shows that most configurations of edges inside large convex polygons contain triangulations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous dissipation and regularization in isotropic Gaussian turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we rigorously establish a number of properties of "turbulent" solutions to the stochastic transport and the stochastic continuity equations constructed by Le Jan and Raimond in [Ann. Probab. 30(2): 826-873, 2002]. The advecting velocity field, not necessarily incompressible, is Gaussian and white-in-time, space-homogeneous and isotropic, with $\alpha$-H\"older regularity in space, $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We cover the full range of compressibility ratios giving spontaneous stochasticity of particle trajectories. For the stochastic transport equation, we prove that generic $L^2_x$ data experience anomalous dissipation of the mean energy, and study basic properties of the resulting anomalous dissipation measure. Moreover, we show that starting from such irregular data, the solution immediately gains regularity and enters into a fractional Sobolev space $H^{1-\alpha-}_x$. The proof of the latter is obtained as a consequence of a new sharp regularity result for the degenerate parabolic PDE satisfied by the associated two-point self-correlation function, which is of independent interest. In the incompressible case, a Duchon-Robert-type formula for the anomalous dissipation measure is derived, making a precise connection between this self-regularizing effect and a limit on the flux of energy in the turbulent cascade. Finally, for the stochastic continuity equation, we prove that solutions starting from a Dirac delta initial condition undergo an average squared dispersion growing with respect to time as $t^{1/(1-\alpha)}$, rigorously establishing the analogue of Richardson's law of particle separations in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions for Elephant Random Walks with Two memory Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elephant random walk, introduced to study the effect of memory on random walks, is a novel type of walk that incorporates the information of one randomly chosen past step to determine the future step. However, memory of a process can be multifaceted and can arise due to interactions of more than one underlying phenomena. To model this, random walks with multiple memory channels were introduced in the statistical physics literature by Saha (2022) - here the information on a bunch of independently chosen past steps is needed to decide the future step. With the help of variance heuristics, this work analyzed the two-channel case and predicted a double phase transition: from diffusive to superdiffusive and from superdiffusive to ballistic regimes. We prove these conjectures rigorously (with some corrections), discover a mildly superdiffusive regime at one of the conjectured transition boundaries, and observe a new second-order phase transition. We also carry out a detailed investigation of the asymptotic behavior of the walk at different regimes.</description>

      <title>Persistence probabilities for fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main object the study is fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise, I(t/a,H) where a&gt;0 is the multiplicity(not necessarily an integer) of integration, and H is the Hurst parameter . The subject of the analysis is the persistence exponent e(a,H) that determines the power-law asymptotic of probability that the process will not exceed a fixit positive level in a growing time interval (0,T). In the important cases (a=1,H) and (a=2,H=1/2) these exponents are well known. To understand the problematic exponents e(2,H), we consider the (a,H) parameters from the maximum (for the task) area G= (a+H&gt;1,a&gt;0,0&lt;H&lt;1) ) . We prove the decrease of the exponents with increasing a and describe their behavior near the boundary of G, including infinity. The discovered identity of the exponents with the parameters (a,H) and (a+2H-1,1-H) actually refutes the long-standing hypothesis that e(2,H)=H(1-H). Our results are based on well known the continuity lemma for the persistence exponents and on a generalization of Slepian's lemma for a family of Gaussian processes smoothly dependent on a parameter.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Learning of Lipschitz Functions under Log-Concave Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regression of $1$-Lipschitz functions under a log-concave measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We focus on the high-dimensional regime where the sample size $n$ is subexponential in $d$, in which distribution-free estimators are ineffective. We analyze two polynomial-based procedures: the projection estimator, which relies on knowledge of an orthogonal polynomial basis of $\mu$, and the least-squares estimator over low-degree polynomials, which requires no knowledge of $\mu$ whatsoever. Their risk is governed by the rate of polynomial approximation of Lipschitz functions in $L^2(\mu)$. When this rate matches the Gaussian one, we show that both estimators achieve minimax bounds over a wide range of parameters. A key ingredient is sharp entropy estimates for the class of $1$-Lipschitz functions in $L^2(\mu)$, which are new even in the Gaussian setting.</description>

      <title>The Single Ring Theorem and a Question of Shub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an orthogonally invariant probability measure on $GL(d,\mathbb{R})$, Mike Shub asked whether the average product of the $k$ top eigenvalues in the ensemble can be lower bounded by the average distortion along $k$ dimensional Grassmanians. Recently, Armentano, Chinta, Sahi, and Shub provided partial progress, however they attach a constant $c_{d,k} \to 0 as d \to \infty$. In this paper, by invoking the Single Ring Theorem and sequels, we show the conjecture asymptotically for the spectral radius, in particular, $c_{d,k} \to 1$ as $d \to \infty$, and $k = 1$.</description>

      <title>A risk-sensitive ergodic singular stochastic control problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-sided singular stochastic control problem with a risk-sensitive ergodic criterion. In particular, we consider a stochastic system whose uncontrolled dynamics are modelled by a linear diffusion. The control that can be applied to the system is modelled by an additive finite variation process. The objective of the control problem is to minimise a risk-sensitive long-term average criterion that penalises deviations of the controlled process from a given interval, as well as the expenditure of control effort. The stochastic control problem has been partly motivated by the problem faced by a central bank who wish to control the exchange rate between its domestic currency and a foreign currency so that this fluctuates within a suitable target zone. We derive the complete solution to the problem under general assumptions by deriving a C2 solution to its HJB equation. To this end, we use the solutions to a suitable family of Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven approximation of transfer operators for mean-field stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field stochastic differential equations, also called McKean--Vlasov equations, are the limiting equations of interacting particle systems with fully symmetric interaction potential. Such systems play an important role in a variety of fields ranging from biology and physics to sociology and economics. Global information about the behavior of complex dynamical systems can be obtained by analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of associated transfer operators such as the Perron--Frobenius operator and the Koopman operator. In this paper, we extend transfer operator theory to McKean--Vlasov equations and show how extended dynamic mode decomposition and the Galerkin projection methodology can be used to compute finite-dimensional approximations of these operators, which allows us to compute spectral properties and thus to identify slowly evolving spatiotemporal patterns or to detect metastable sets. The results will be illustrated with the aid of several guiding examples and benchmark problems including the Cormier model, the Kuramoto model, and a three-dimensional generalization of the Kuramoto model.</description>

      <title>A Smooth Computational Transition in Tensor PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient algorithm for tensor PCA based on counting a specific family of weighted hypergraphs. For the order-$p$ tensor PCA problem where $p \geq 3$ is a fixed integer, we show that when the signal-to-noise ratio is $\lambda n^{-\frac{p}{4}}$ where $\lambda=\Omega(1)$, our algorithm succeeds and runs in time $n^{C+o(1)}$ where $C=C(\lambda)$ is a constant depending on $\lambda$. This algorithm improves a poly-logarithmic factor compared to previous algorithms based on the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy \cite{HSS15} or based on the Kikuchi hierarchy in statistical physics \cite{WEM19}. Furthermore, our result shows a smooth tradeoff between the signal-to-noise ratio and the computational cost in this problem, thereby confirming a conjecture posed in \cite{KWB22}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of solutions to a class of evolution equations arising from random-time changes driven by subordinators. Our focus is on fractional diffusion equations involving mixed local and nonlocal operators. By combining techniques from probability theory, asymptotic analysis, and partial differential equations (PDEs), we characterize the dynamics of the subordinated solutions. This approach extends classical fractional dynamics and establishes a deeper connection between stochastic processes and deterministic PDEs.</description>

Abstract: We prove quantitative homogenization results for harmonic functions on supercritical continuum percolation clusters--that is, Poisson point clouds with edges connecting points which are closer than some fixed distance. We show that, on large scales, harmonic functions resemble harmonic functions in Euclidean space with sharp quantitative bounds on their difference. In particular, for every point cloud which is supercritical (meaning that the intensity of the Poisson process is larger than the critical parameter which guarantees the existence of an infinite connected component), we obtain optimal corrector bounds, homogenization error estimates and large-scale regularity results.</description>

      <title>Can one condition a killed random walk to survive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ killed with probability $p(|x|)$ at site $x$ for a function $p$ decaying at infinity. Due to recurrence in dimension $d=2$, the killed random walk (KRW) dies almost surely if $p$ is positive, while in dimension $d \geq 3$ it is known that the KRW dies almost surely if and only if $\int_0^{\infty}rp(r)dr = \infty$, under mild technical assumptions on $p$. In this paper we consider, for any $d \geq 2$, functions $p$ for which the KRW dies almost surely and we ask ourselves if the KRW conditioned to survive is well-defined. More precisely, given an exhaustion $(\Lambda_R)_{R \in \mathbb{N}}$ of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, does the KRW conditioned to leave $\Lambda_R$ before dying converges in distribution towards a limit which does not depend on the exhaustion? We first prove that this conditioning is well-defined for $p(r) = o(r^{-2})$, and that it is not for $p(r) = \min(1, r^{-\alpha})$ for $\alpha \in (14/9,2)$. This question is connected to branching random walks and the infinite snake. More precisely, in dimension $d=4$, the infinite snake is related to the KRW with $p(r) \asymp (r^2\log(r))^{-1}$, therefore our results imply that the infinite snake conditioned to avoid the origin in four dimensions is well-defined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the scaling limit of the geodesics to the root for the first passage percolation distance on random planar maps. We first describe the scaling limit of the number of faces along the geodesics. This result enables us to compare the metric balls for the first passage percolation and the dual graph distance. It also enables us to give an upper bound for the diameter of large random maps. Then, we describe the scaling limit of the tree of first passage percolation geodesics to the root via a stochastic coalescing flow of pure jump diffusions. Using this stochastic flow, we also construct some random metric spaces which we conjecture to be the scaling limits of random planar maps with high degrees. The main tool in this work is a time-reversal of the uniform peeling exploration.</description>

      <title>A diffusion limit for Markov chains with log-linear interaction on a graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a diffusion limit for a multivariate continuous time Markov chain whose components are indexed by vertices of a finite graph. The components take values in a common finite set of non-negative integers and evolve subject to a graph based log-linear interaction. We show that if the set of common values of the components expands to the set of all non-negative integers, then a time-scaled and normalised version of the Markov chain converges to a system of interacting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes reflected at the origin. This limit is akin to heavy traffic limits in queueing (and our model can be naturally interpreted as a queueing model). Our proof draws on developments in queueing theory and relies on martingale methods.</description>

      <title>A study of the Antlion Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random walks (RWs) are fundamental stochastic processes with applications across physics, computer science, and information processing. A recent extension, the laser chaos decision-maker, employs chaotic time series from semiconductor lasers to solve multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems at ultrafast speeds, and its threshold adjustment mechanism has been modeled as an RW. However, previous analyses assumed complete memory preservation ($\alpha = 1$), overlooking the role of partial memory in balancing exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we introduce the Antlion Random Walk (ARW), defined by $X_t = \alpha X_{t-1} + \xi_t$ with $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and Rademacher-distributed increments $(\xi_t)$, which describes a walker pulled back toward the origin before each step. We show that varying $\alpha$ significantly alters ARW dynamics, yielding distributions that range from uniform-like to normal-like. Through mathematical and numerical analyses, we investigate expectation, variance, reachability, positive-side residence time, and distributional similarity. Our results place ARWs within the framework of autoregressive (AR(1)) processes while highlighting distinct non-Gaussian features, thereby offering new theoretical insights into memory-aware stochastic modeling of decision-making systems.</description>

      <title>Symplectic techniques for stochastic differential equations on reductive Lie groups with applications to Langevin diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how Langevin diffusions can be interpreted in the context of stochastic Hamiltonian systems with structure-preserving noise and dissipation on reductive Lie groups. Reductive Lie groups provide the setting in which the Lie group structure is compatible with Riemannian structures, via the existence of bi-invariant metrics. This structure allows for the explicit construction of Riemannian Brownian motion via symplectic techniques, which permits the study of Langevin diffusions with noise in the position coordinate as well as Langevin diffusions with noise in both momentum and position.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for East models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the East model in $\mathbb Z^d$, an example of a kinetically constrained interacting particle system with oriented constraints, together with one of its natural variant. Under any ergodic boundary condition it is known that the mixing time of the chain in a box of side $L$ is $\Theta(L)$ for any $d\ge 1$. Moreover, with minimal boundary conditions and at low temperature, i.e. low equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices, the chain exhibits cutoff around the mixing time of the $d=1$ case. Here we extend this result to high equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices. As in the low density case, the key tool is to prove that the speed of infection propagation in the $(1,1,\dots,1)$ direction is larger than $d$ $\times$ the same speed along a coordinate direction. By borrowing a technique from first passage percolation, the proof links the result to the precise value of the critical probability of oriented (bond or site) percolation in $\mathbb Z^d$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Processes and Diffusion Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we explore the mathematical preliminaries and foundational concepts that connect stochastic processes with partial differential equations. We begin by investigating Brownian motion, which serves as a model for random fluctuations and is deeply connected to the heat equation. This connection forms the basis for understanding diffusion phenomena, where the probability distribution of Brownian motion evolves according to the heat equation over time. To extend this classical result to more general stochastic systems, we introduce the It\^o calculus, a powerful framework that allows us to analyze processes driven by both deterministic drift and stochastic fluctuations. This mathematical tool is essential for understanding the dynamics of more complex diffusion processes, where randomness is no longer purely Brownian, but also depends on the underlying system's state. Building on these concepts, we turn to the study of diffusion processes, which generalize Brownian motion by incorporating the Fokker-Planck equation. This equation describes how the probability density of a diffusion process evolves over time and serves as an extension of the heat equation to more complex stochastic systems. By using It\^o calculus, we can rigorously study how these processes behave and connect the microscopic randomness of individual particles to their macroscopic description via partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced noise sensitivity, 2D directed polymers and Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate noise sensitivity beyond the classical setting of binary random variables, extending the celebrated result by Benjamini, Kalai, and Schramm to a wide class of functions of general random variables. Our approach yields improved bounds with optimal rates. We also consider an enhanced form of noise sensitivity which yields asymptotic independence, rather than mere decorrelation.
  We apply these result to establish enhanced noise sensitivity for the partition functions of 2D directed polymers, in the critical regime where they converge to the critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow. As a consequence, we prove that the Stochastic Heat Flow is independent of the white noise arising from the disorder.</description>

Abstract: Let $W_t(\theta)$ be the Biggins martingale of a supercritical branching L\'evy process with non-local branching mechanism, and denote by $W_\infty(\theta)$ its limit. In this paper, we first study moment properties of $W_t(\theta)$ and $W_\infty(\theta)$, and the tail behavior of $W_\infty(\theta)$. We then apply these results to establish central limit theorems for $W_t(\theta)-W_\infty(\theta)$.</description>

      <title>(Un)biased data and spin glasses reveal clustering for Turing phase transitions within human-transformer interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a Large Language Model's ability to exhibit intelligence equivalent to that of a human by analyzing temperature-induced phase transitions, abrupt changes in the macroscopic behavior of a system, in the Turing test. We utilize three approaches: statistical analysis and bias quantification of a human evaluation survey, information retrieval from real human-written versus AI-generated text data using cosine similarity as a comparison metric, and mathematical spin glass model and simulation. We collect text data in the case study of Flitzing, a tradition of emailing poem-like romantic invitations at Dartmouth College because of its richness in information. Across the three approaches, we obtain consistency in phase transition and clustering results, which also align with literature on the mathematics of transformers and metastability. Our work inspires utilizing spin glass theory for the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence, especially under environmental stochasticity from human interactions, with justification from real data.</description>
