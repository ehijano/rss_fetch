      <title>Efficient pore space characterization based on the curvature of the distance map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Media classification and the construction of pore network models from binary images of porous media hinges on accurately characterizing the pore space. We present an efficient method for (i) locating critical points, that is, pore body and throat centers, and (ii) partitioning of the pore space using information on the curvature of the distance map (DM) of the binary image. Specifically, we use the local maxima and minima of the determinant map of the Hessian matrix of the DM to locate the center of pore bodies and throats. The locating step provides structural information on the pore system, such as pore body and throat size distributions and the mean coordination number. The partitioning step is based on the eigenvalues of the Hessian, rather than the DM, to characterize the pore space using either watershed or medial axis transforms. This strategy eliminates the common problem of saddle-induced over-partitioning shared by all traditional marker-based watershed methods and represents an efficient method to determine the skeleton of the pore space without the need for morphological reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Evaluation cartographique du niveau de potentialit{\'e}s {\'e}cologiques des sites des partenaires (CARPO). Cadre m{\'e}thodologique V0</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cartographic Assessment of Ecological Potential (CARPO) allows users to characterize the ecological context of a group of sites at several scales (its perimeter and surrounding area) and on the basis of 4 themes: biodiversity zonings, land use (major types of environment, natural character and degree of permeability of territories), ecological connectivity (biodiversity reservoirs and corridors, non-fragmentation of the sector studied), as well as the richness of the territory in terms of heritage species. It is based on a battery of 8 indicators linked to these themes and a system of evaluation thresholds, used to define 3 levels of ecological potential (average, strong and very strong) for each indicator and at each scale of study. The level of potentiality reflects the importance that an ecological element takes on in a study area, and therefore the degree of contribution and responsibility of a site in maintaining this element favorable to biodiversity. It also translates into an alert level for biodiversity that needs to be taken into account at a site.The ecological diagnosis is materialized by means of a cartographic atlas containing a set of commented maps and figures, as well as evaluation grids and radars for the various indicators.CARPO is a decision-making tool, as it enables users to compare the ecological potential within a site with that of its surroundings, in order to define preservation, management or restoration actions; and to compare the extent of potential between the different sites in the group, with a goal of prioritizing action.This guide presents the methodological framework for applying CARPO to a group of sites.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh Taylor Instability in Multiple Finite-Thickness Fluid Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general transfer-matrix formalism for determining the growth rate of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a fluid system with spatially varying density and viscosity. We use this formalism to analytically and numerically treat the case of a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We introduce the inviscid-flow approximation in our transfer-matrix formalism to find analytic solutions in the limit of uniform kinematic viscosity for a stratified heterogeneous fluid. We discuss the applicability of these results and the no-acceleration approximation that also yields analytical solutions in the large viscosity limit.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed deep learning fully quantifies uncertainty in seismic structure and source estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The source estimation of earthquakes and other fault activities in seismogenic subduction zones is essential for hazard assessment. Accurate and reliable earthquake source estimation (ESE) requires full uncertainty quantification (UQ), including uncertainty of assumed subsurface seismic velocity structure that propagates to ESE, which is technically challenging. Here, we address this problem by adopting a physics-informed deep learning approach that enables such full UQ-based ESE by introducing neural network ensembles trained based on active seismic survey data, earthquake observation data, and the physical equation of wavefront propagation. The proposed full UQ-based approach enabled a rapid, accurate and quantitative investigation of the rupture characteristic of an earthquake in southwest Japan in the light of subsurface structural boundaries under uncertainty, which is informative for both the scientific community and public. Our results demonstrate innovations toward stronger scientific objectivity in the studies of seismogenic zones empowered by physics-informed deep learning.</description>
