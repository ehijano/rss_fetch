      <title>Charge and spin fluctuations in superconductors with intersublattice and interorbital interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiband superconductors have featured one of the main challenges to achieve a comprehensive understanding of unconventional superconductivity. Here, the multiband character is studied separately as orbital and sublattice degrees of freedom, as they have different effects for the superconducting and magnetic or charge orders. We build on the framework of the matrix random-phase approximation (RPA), which accounts for the RPA Feynman diagrams and also vertex corrections, to treat the electron-electron interactions in an off-site degenerate Hubbard model. As a result, systems without a sublattice degree of freedom tend to be dominated by spin fluctuations, while systems with multiple sublattice sites and orbitals have the charge fluctuations favored. Finally, we explicitly demonstrate that the known suppression of the superconducting pairing strength $\lambda$ by spin fluctuations from repulsive interactions at zero momentum transfer $\boldsymbol{q}$ is countered by the finite-$\boldsymbol{q}$ pairing, which always improves $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical fluctuations generate intensely magnetic field-resilient superconductivity in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum critical phase boundaries (QCPBs) -- where a continuous phase transition occurs at zero temperature -- have been found to nucleate novel electronic states in a number of strongly correlated materials. Emergent electronic phases, such as unconventional superconductivity, frequently occur in close proximity to a QCPB. However, the antagonism between magnetic field and superconductivity generally suppresses such superconductive phases to modest magnetic field ranges, except in notable cases such as the high-$T_\text{c}$ cuprates. Here we show that the heavy fermion Kondo-lattice system UTe$_2$ possesses a QCPB at remarkably high magnetic fields $\sim$ 50 T, underpinning an extremely high field superconducting state that persists to fields $&gt; \sim$ 70 T despite its relatively modest transition temperature of $T_\text{c} \approx$ 2 K. Whereas previous studies found this superconducting state to exist exclusively inside a field-polarised paramagnetic host-phase accessed following a first-order metamagnetic transition, for magnetic field tilt angles in the rotation plane connecting the reciprocal (010) and (101) vectors, we find an extended region of this superconductivity outside the field-polarised state. In this special rotation plane we also observe a pronounced suppression of the metamagnetic transition towards zero temperature, revealing that the metamagnetic transition surface ends at a QCPB. The superconducting $T_\text{c}$ exhibits a strong angular dependence and is enhanced close to the QCPB, where the onset of superconductivity is stretched over a surprisingly large magnetic field range reaching as low as 30 T. We model our data by a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, and show how an extended quantum critical line -- rather than a more conventional QCPB at a singular point -- anchors the remarkable high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Unraveling spin texture and spin-orbit coupling contributions in spin triplet superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, it has been proposed theoretically and confirmed experimentally that long-range spin triplet (LRT) superconductivity can be generated in ferromagnet-superconductor hybrids either by the presence of spin textures (ST-LRT) or thanks to spin-orbit coupling (SOC-LRT). Nevertheless, there has been no theoretical or experimental investigation to date suggesting that both contributions could simultaneously exist within an experimental system. To disentangle these contributions, we present a comprehensive study of superconducting quasiparticle interference effects taking place inside a ferromagnetic layer interfacing a superconductor, through the investigation of above-gap conductance anomalies (CAs) related to MacMillan-Rowell resonances. The bias dependence of the CAs has been studied under a wide range of in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) magnetic fields in two types of epitaxial, V/MgO/Fe-based ferromagnet-superconductor junctions with interfacial spin-orbit coupling. We observe an anisotropy of the CAs amplitude under small IP and OOP magnetic fields while remaining weakly affected by high fields, and implement micromagnetic simulations to help us distinguish between the ST-LRT and SOC-LRT contributions. Our findings suggest that further exploration of Fabry-P\'erot type interference effects in electron transport could yield valuable insights into the hybridization between superconductors and ferromagnets induced by spin-orbit coupling and spin textures.</description>

      <title>Predictive power of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory based on Renormalization Group throughout the BCS-BEC crossover in 2D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on 2D superconductors allow the characterization of the critical temperature and of the phase diagram across the BCS-BEC crossover as a function of density. We obtain from these experiments the microscopic parameters of the superconducting state at low temperatures by the BCS mean-field approach. For Li$_x$ZrNCl, the extracted parameters are used to evaluate the superconducting phase stiffness and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical temperature throughout the BCS-BEC crossover, by implementing the corresponding Renormalization Group (RG) approach. In this way, we make a quantitative test of the predictive power of the BKT theory for evaluating the critical temperature. The RG flow equations turn out to give a sizable renormalization of the phase stiffness and of the critical temperature, which is crucial to obtain a satisfactory agreement between the BKT theory and the experiments, in particular in the BCS-BEC crossover regime. We predict the temperature range where phase stiffness renormalization can be measured in Li$_x$ZrNCl across the BCS-BEC crossover. Contrary to other microscopic theories of superconductivity, we find that the BKT theory can be exploited to evaluate quantitatively the critical temperature of 2D superconductors in different pairing regimes.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Ca-intercalated bilayer silicene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within first-principles calculations, we explore superconductivity in Ca-intercalated bilayer silicene compound, Si2CaSi2. This arises from the coupling of interlayer flower-like \Gamma-centered Fermi surface formed by the hybridization of Ca-3d and Si-3pz orbitals with low-energy out-of-plane vibrations enabled by silicene's buckling. The consequent large electron-phonon coupling, as evident from the Eliashberg spectral function leads to superconductivity below 5.4 K in this two-dimensional covalent system. Our results reveal the key control parameters to achieve superconductivity in experimentally synthesizable silicon-based thin materials that can find diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamic Majorana Hybridization for Universal Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes have long been theorized as a potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors in the braiding process. This work presents an accessible method to track transitions within the low-energy subspace and predict the output of braids with hybridized Majorana modes. As an application, we characterize Pauli qubit-errors, as demonstrated on an X-gate, critical for the successful operation of any quantum computer. Further, we perform numerical simulations to demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement arbitrary rotations, along with a two-qubit controlled magic gate, thus providing a demonstration of universal quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Dynamical decoding of the competition between charge density waves in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ hosts a variety of charge density wave (CDW) phases, which play a fundamental role in the formation of other exotic electronic instabilities. However, identifying the precise structure of these CDW phases and their intricate relationships remain the subject of intense debate, due to the lack of static probes that can distinguish the CDW phases with identical spatial periodicity. Here, we unveil the competition between two coexisting $2\times2\times2$ CDWs in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ harnessing time-resolved X-ray diffraction. By analyzing the light-induced changes in the intensity of CDW superlattice peaks, we demonstrate the presence of both phases, each displaying a significantly different amount of melting upon excitation. The anomalous light-induced sharpening of peak width further shows that the phase that is more resistant to photo-excitation exhibits an increase in domain size at the expense of the other, thereby showcasing a hallmark of phase competition. Our results not only shed light on the interplay between the multiple CDW phases in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, but also establish a non-equilibrium framework for comprehending complex phase relationships that are challenging to disentangle using static techniques.</description>

      <title>Effective models for dense vortex lattices in the Kitaev honeycomb model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce low-energy effective models for dense configurations of vortices in the Kitaev honeycomb model. Specifically, we consider configurations of vortices in which vortex-free plaquettes form triangular lattices against a vortex-full background. Depending on the vortex density, these "dual" configurations belong to either one of two families classified by translation and inversion symmetry. As a function of a time-reversal symmetry breaking term, one family exhibits gapped phases with even Chern numbers separated by extended gapless phases, while the other exhibits gapped phases with even or odd Chern numbers, separated by critical points. We construct an effective model for each family, determine the parameters of these models by fitting the integrated density of states, and reproduce energy spectra and Chern numbers of the Kitaev honeycomb model. We also derive phase diagrams and determine these models' validity.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound states in superconductor-barrier-superconductor junctions of Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a superconductor-barrier-superconductor configuration built with Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetal, which features four bands crossing at a single nodal point. Assuming a homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and the barrier region created by applying a voltage of magnitude $V_0 $ across a piece of normal state semimetal, we apply the BdG formalism to compute the discrete energy spectrum $\varepsilon $ of the subgap Andreev bound states in the short-barrier regime. In contrast with the two-band semimetals studied earlier, we find upto four pairs of localized states (rather than one pair for two-band semimetals) in the thin-barrier limit, and each value of $\varepsilon $ has a complicated dependence on the phase difference $\varphi_{12} $ via cosine and sine functions, which cannot be determined analytically. These are artifacts of multi-band nodes hosting quasiparticles of pseudospin values greater than $1/2$. Using the bound state energies, we compute the Josephson current across the junction configuration.</description>

      <title>A-15 type superconducting hydride $La_4H_{23}$: Nanograined structure with low strain, strong electron-phonon interaction, and moderate level of nonadiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For seven decades by A-15 superconductors we meant metallic $A_3B$ alloys (where A is a transition metal, and B is groups IIIB and IVB element) discovered by Hardy and Hulm (Phys. Rev. 89, 884 (1953)). Nb3Ge exhibited the highest superconducting transition temperature, $T_c = 23 K$, among these alloys. One of these alloys, $Nb_3Sn$, is primary material in modern applied superconductivity. Recently Guo et al (arXiv:2307.13067) extended the family of superconductors where the metallic ions arranged in the beta tungsten (A-15) sublattice by observation of $T_{c,zero} = 81 K$ in $La_4H_{23}$ phase compressed at $P = 118 GPa$. Despite the $La_4H_{23}$ has much lower $T_c$ in comparison with near-room-temperature superconducting $LaH_{10}$ phase ($T_{c,zero} = 250 K$ at $P = 200 GPa$) discovered by Drozdov et al (Nature 569, 531 (2019)), the $La_4H_{23}$ holds the record high $T_c$ within A-15 family. Cross et al (Phys. Rev. B 109, L020503 (2024)) confirmed the high-temperature superconductivity in the compressed $La_4H_{23}$. In this paper, we analyzed available experimental data measured in $La_4H_{23}$ and found that this superconductor exhibits nanograined structure, 6 nm &lt; D &lt; 27 nm, low crystalline strain &lt; 0.005, high electron-phonon coupling constant, 1.5 &lt; $\lambda_{e-ph}$ &lt; 2.7, and moderate level of the nonadiabaticity $\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$. We found that derived $\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$ and $T_c/T_F$ values for the $La_4H_{23}$ phase are similar to the ones in cuprates, pnictides, and near-room-temperature superconductors $H_3S$ and $LaH_{10}$, which implies that the $La_4H_{23}$ phase falls to unconventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot.</description>

Abstract: Majorana fermions, exotic particles with potential applications in quantum computing, have garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics. The Kitaev model serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the emergence of Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. We explore the intriguing question of whether Majorana fermions can arise in a NM side-coupled to a Kitaev chain (KC) in the topologically trivial phase. Our findings reveal affirmative evidence, further demonstrating that the KC, when in the topological phase, can induce additional Majorana fermions in the neighboring NM region. Through extensive parameter analysis, we uncover the potential for zero, one, or two pairs of Majorana fermions in a KC side-coupled to an NM. Additionally, we investigate the impact of magnetic flux on the system and calculate the winding number -- a topological invariant -- to characterize the phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Deformation of a N\'eel-type Skyrmion in a Weak Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field: Magnetization Ansatz and Interaction with a Pearl Vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theory of (meta)stable states of N\'eel-type skyrmions in weak nonuniform magnetic fields. We claim an Ansatz for modeling the non-symmetric magnetization that can be implied for both analytics and numerical simulations. Our theory accounts for changes in the size of skyrmion parameters and also includes deformations from the centrally symmetric shape. The ansatz streamlines the analytic calculation of the skyrmion free energy, enhancing the efficiency of the minimizing process. Performing the minimization in two stages, one can find all the minima, global and local, of the free energy, discovering the stable and metastable states. We apply the developed methodology to investigate the (meta)stable configurations of skyrmions influenced by the stray field of a Pearl vortex. Our study reveals the dependence of skyrmion spatial parameters on the vortex field effective strength and presents a phase diagram identifying regions where metastable configurations are predicted. Corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, our findings offer a detailed perspective on the interaction between magnetic skyrmions and superconducting vortices.</description>
