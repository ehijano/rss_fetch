      <title>Cosmological Unstraightening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unstraightening construction due to Lurie establishes an equivalence between presheaves and fibrations, using one prominent model of $(\infty,1)$-categories, namely quasi-categories. In this work we generalize this result by proving that for all $\infty$-cosmoi of $(\infty,1)$-categories in the sense of Riehl and Verity, which includes quasi-categories but also complete Segal spaces or $1$-complicial sets, their corresponding notions of fibrations and presheaves are biequivalent $\infty$-cosmoi via a natural zig-zag of cosmological biequivalences. The major idea that makes this possible is a lift of the quasi-categorical unstraightening construction to a cosmological biequivalence.</description>

      <title>The sheaves--spectrum adjunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper demystifies the notion of the smashing spectrum of a stable presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category, defined as a locale whose opens correspond to smashing localizations. Previously, this concept was studied in tensor-triangular geometry in the compactly generated rigid setting. Our main result identifies the smashing spectrum functor as the right adjoint to the spectral sheaves functor, providing in particular an external characterization that avoids explicit reference to objects, ideals, or localizations. The sheaves--spectrum adjunction formalizes the intuition that the smashing spectrum constitutes the best approximation of a given $\infty$-category by $\infty$-categories of sheaves. We establish an unstable generalization of this result by identifying the correct unstable analog of the smashing spectrum, which parametrizes smashing colocalizations instead.
  As an application, we give a categorical presentation of Clausen--Scholze's categorified locales.</description>

      <title>Orbital categories and weak indexing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the combinatorial study of the poset $\mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing systems, consisting of composable collections of arities for $\mathcal{T}$-equivariant algebraic structures, where $\mathcal{T}$ is an orbital $\infty$-category, such as the orbit category of a finite group. In particular, we show that these are equivalent to weak $\mathcal{T}$-indexing categories and characterize various unitality conditions.
  Within this sits a natural generalization $\mathrm{Index}_{\mathcal{T}} \subset \mathrm{wIndex}_{\mathcal{T}}$ of Blumberg-Hill's indexing systems, consisting of arities for structures possessing binary operations and unit elements. We characterize the relationship between the posets of unital weak indexing systems and indexing systems, the latter remaining isomorphic to transfer systems on this level of generality. We use this to characterize the poset of unital $C_{p^n}$-weak indexing systems.</description>

      <title>A categorical account of composition methods in logic (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a categorical theory of the composition methods in finite model theory -- a key technique enabling modular reasoning about complex structures by building them out of simpler components. The crucial results required by the composition methods are Feferman--Vaught--Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and transformation of models.
  Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad semantics for model comparison games. This level of abstraction allow us to give conditions yielding FVM type results in a uniform way. Our theorems are parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved. Furthermore, they naturally account for the existential and positive existential fragments, and extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of monads.
  We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments.
  This is an extended version of the LiCS 2023 conference paper of the same name.</description>

      <title>Enhancement for categories and homotopical algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop foundations for abstract homotopy theory based on Grothendieck's idea of a "derivator". The theory is model-independent, and does not depend on model categories, nor on simplicial sets. It is designed to accomodate all the usual potential applications, such as e.g. enhancements for derived categories of coherent sheaves, in a way that is as close as possible to usual category theory.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and singly-generated torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that each torsion class of abelian groups is generated by a single group within the class (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>

      <title>Non-Hausdorff manifolds over locally ordered spaces via sheaf theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally ordered spaces can be used as topological models of concurrent programs: in that setting, the local order models the irreversibility of time during execution. Under certain conditions, one can even work with locally ordered manifolds. In this paper, we build the universal euclidean local order over every locally ordered space; in categorical terms, the subcategory of euclidean local orders is coreflective in the category of locally ordered spaces. Then we give conditions to ensure that it preserves the execution traces of the corresponding program. Our construction is based on a well-known correspondance between sheaves on a space and \'etale bundles over this space. This is a far reaching generalization of a result about realizations of graph products. We particularize the construction to locally ordered realization of precubical sets, and show that it admits a purely combinatorial description. With the same proof techniques, we show that, unlike for the topological realization, there is a unique precubical set whose locally ordered realization is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>
