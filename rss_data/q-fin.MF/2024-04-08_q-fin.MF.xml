      <title>Generalized measure Black-Scholes equation: Towards option self-similar pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we give a generalized formulation of the Black-Scholes model. The novelty resides in considering the Black-Scholes model to be valid on 'average', but such that the pointwise option price dynamics depends on a measure representing the investors' 'uncertainty'. We make use of the theory of non-symmetric Dirichlet forms and the abstract theory of partial differential equations to establish well posedness of the problem. A detailed numerical analysis is given in the case of self-similar measures.</description>

      <title>Non-concave distributionally robust stochastic control in a discrete time finite horizon setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present a general framework for non-concave distributionally robust stochastic control problems in a discrete time finite horizon setting. Our framework allows to consider a variety of different path-dependent ambiguity sets of probability measures comprising, as a natural example, the ambiguity set defined via Wasserstein-balls around path-dependent reference measures, as well as parametric classes of probability distributions. We establish a dynamic programming principle which allows to derive both optimal control and worst-case measure by solving recursively a sequence of one-step optimization problems. As a concrete application, we study the robust hedging problem of a financial derivative under an asymmetric (and non-convex) loss function accounting for different preferences of sell- and buy side when it comes to the hedging of financial derivatives. As our entirely data-driven ambiguity set of probability measures, we consider Wasserstein-balls around the empirical measure derived from real financial data. We demonstrate that during adverse scenarios such as a financial crisis, our robust approach outperforms typical model-based hedging strategies such as the classical Delta-hedging strategy as well as the hedging strategy obtained in the non-robust setting with respect to the empirical measure and therefore overcomes the problem of model misspecification in such critical periods.</description>
