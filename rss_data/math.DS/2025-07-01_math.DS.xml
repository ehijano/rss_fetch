      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred canonical coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse square and inverse cubic radial forces (or any superposition thereof) on any finite-dimensional Euclidean space. From these solutions, a new set of orbit elements for Kepler-Coulomb dynamics is derived, along with their variational equations for arbitrary perturbations (singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion). Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem, incorporating the J_2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities for random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish concentration inequalities for random dynamical systems (RDSs), assuming that the observables of interest are separately Lipschitz. Under a weak average contraction condition, we obtain deviation bounds for several random quantities, including time-average synchronization, empirical measures, Birkhoff sums, and correlation dimension estimators. We present concrete classes of RDSs to which our main results apply, such as finitely supported diffeomorphisms on the circle and projective systems induced by linear cocycles. In both cases, we obtain concentration inequalities for finite-time Lyapunov exponents.</description>

      <title>Subordinacy theory for long-range operators: hyperbolic geodesic flow insights and monotonicity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for subordinacy theory applicable to long-range operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb Z)$, bridging dynamical systems and spectral analysis. For finite-range operators, we establish a correspondence between the dynamical behavior of partially hyperbolic (Hermitian-)symplectic cocycles and the existence of purely absolutely continuous spectrum, resolving an open problem posed by Jitomirskaya. For infinite-range operators-where traditional cocycle methods become inapplicable-we characterize absolutely continuous spectrum through the growth of generalized eigenfunctions, extending techniques from higher-dimensional lattice models.
  Our main results include the first rigorous proof of purely absolutely continuous spectrum for quasi-periodic long-range operators with analytic potentials and Diophantine frequencies-in particular, the first proof of the all-phases persistence for finite-range perturbations of subcritical almost Mathieu operators-among other advances in spectral theory of long-range operators.
  The key novelty of our approach lies in the unanticipated connection between stable/vertical bundle intersections in geodesic flows-where they detect conjugate points-and their equally fundamental role in governing (de-)localization for Schr\"odinger operators. The geometric insight, combined with a novel coordinate-free monotonicity theory for general bundles (including its preservation under center-bundle restrictions) and adapted analytic spectral and KAM techniques, enables our spectral analysis of long-range operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critically finite branched self-cover $f: (S^2, P) \to (S^2, P)$ determines naturally three iterated function systems: one on the pure mapping class group of the sphere marked at $P$, one on the Teichm\"uller space of the sphere marked at $P$, and one on a finite-dimensional real vector space. We show that contraction for any one of these systems implies contraction for the others.</description>

      <title>A note on multivariate diam mean equicontinuity and frequent stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,G)$ be a topological dynamical system, given by the action of a is a countable discrete infinite group on a compact metric space $X$. We prove that if $(X,G)$ is minimal, then it is either diam-mean $m$-equicontinuious or diam-mean $m$-sensitive. Similarly, $(X,G)$ is either frequently $m$-stable or strongly $m$-spreading. Further, when $G$ is abelian (or, more generally, virtually nilpotent), then the following statements are equivalent:
  $\bullet$ $(X,G)$ is a regular $m$-to-one extension of its maximal equicontinuous factor;
  $\bullet$ $(X,G)$ is diam-mean $(m+1)$-equicontinuious, and not diam mean $m$-equicontinuious;
  $\bullet$ $(X,G)$ is not diam-mean $(m+1)$-sensitive, but diam mean $m$-sensitive;
  $\bullet$ $(X,G)$ has an essential weakly mean sensitive $m$-tuple but no essential weakly mean sensitive $(m+1)$-tuple.
  This provides a {\em \enquote*{local}} characterisation of $m$-regularity and mean $m$-sensitivity vial weakly mean sensitive tuples. The same result holds when $G$ is amenable and $(X,G)$ satisfies the local Bronstein condition.</description>

      <title>Degenerate perturbations of infinite graph-directed iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study infinite graph-directed iterated function systems (GIFS) whose underlying graph is not strongly connected and has countably many vertices and edges. In addition to a summability condition for the physical potential, we provide lower and upper estimates of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of such GIFS. Bowen type formula is also given under conformal condition and suitable separate conditions. We also introduce perturbed GIFS in which the images of arbitrarily chosen contraction mappings shrink to a single point. In other words, the graph of the perturbed GIFS differs from that of unperturbed GIFS. Assuming suitable continuity condition on contraction mappings, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of the perturbed GIFS converges to that of the unperturbed GIFS, This result generalizes for finite graphs in [T.2019, T.2016] to the infinite graph setting. As applications, we consider a perturbed nonconformal mapping, as well as convergence and non-convergence in the Hausdorff dimension for perturbed complex continued fractions with degeneration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine weak asymptotics of counting functions on generic surfaces in a component of a stratum of $k$-differentials when $k$ is prime and genus is greater than $2$. In order to do so, we classify the $GL^+(2,\mathbb{R})$-orbit closure of holonomy covers of components and apply Eskin-Mirzakhani-Mohammadi generalized to translation surfaces. We show that the $GL^+(2,\mathbb{R})$-orbit closure of these holonomy covers is generically a component of a stratum of translation surfaces or a hyperelliptic locus therein.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Carbon Dioxide Emissions with GDP Linkage: Sensitivity Analysis and Optimal Control Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change and global warming are among the most significant issues that humanity is currently facing, and also among the issues that pose the greatest threats to all mankind. These issues are primarily driven by abnormal increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. Mathematical modeling serves as a powerful approach to analyze the dynamic patterns of atmospheric carbon dioxide. In this paper, we established a mathmetical model with four state variables to investigate the dynamic behavior of the interaction between atmospheric carbon dioxide, GDP, forest area and human population. Relevant theories were employed to analyze the system's boundedness and the stability of equilibrium points. The parameter values were estimated with the help of the actual data in China and numerical fitting was carried out to verify the results of the theoretical analysis. The sensitivity analysis of the compartments with respect to the model parameters was analyzed by using the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) and the Latin Hypercube Sampling test. Apply the optimal control theory to regulate the atmospheric carbon dioxide level and provide the corresponding numerical fitting. Finally, corresponding discussions and suggestions were put forward with the help of the results of the theoretical analysis and numerical fitting.</description>

Abstract: We consider motion of a material point placed in a constant homogeneous magnetic field restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. We provide a Lax representation of the equations of motion for arbitrary $n$ and prove integrability of those systems in the Liouville sense. The integrability is provided via first integrals of degree one and two.</description>

Abstract: We establish the minimal model program (MMP) for generalized foliated threefolds $(X, \mathcal{F}, B, \mathbf{M})$ of rank 1, extending the result of Cascini and Spicer in [CS20]. As an application of the generalized foliated MMP, we prove a base-point-free theorem for foliated triples on threefolds. We also prove the ACC for log canonical thresholds for generalized foliated threefolds of rank 1.</description>

      <title>Learning Structured Population Models from Data with WSINDy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of population dynamics, identifying effective model features, such as fecundity and mortality rates, is generally a complex and computationally intensive process, especially when the dynamics are heterogeneous across the population. In this work, we propose a Weak form Scientific Machine Learning-based method for selecting appropriate model ingredients from a library of scientifically feasible functions used to model structured populations. This method uses extensions of the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) method to select the best-fitting ingredients from noisy time-series histogram data. This extension includes learning heterogeneous dynamics and also learning the boundary process of the model directly from the data. We additionally provide a cross-validation method which helps fine tune the recovered boundary process to the data.
  Several test cases are considered, demonstrating the method's performance for different previously studied models, including age and size-structured models. Through these examples, we examine both the advantages and limitations of the method, with a particular focus on the distinguishability of terms in the library.</description>

Abstract: Following the approach pioneered by Eckhaus, Mielke, Schneider, and others for reaction diffusion systems [E, M1, M2, S1, S2, SZJV], we systematically derive formally by multiscale expansion and justify rigorously by Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction amplitude equations describing Turing-type bifurcations of general reaction diffusion convection systems. Notably, our analysis includes also higher-order, nonlocal, and even certain semilinear hyperbolic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a framework for turning a numerical simulation of a gap soliton in the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation into a formal mathematical proof of its existence. These nonlinear localized solutions play a central role in understanding Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We reformulate the problem of proving their existence as the search for homoclinic orbits in a dynamical system. We then apply computer-assisted proof techniques to obtain verifiable conditions under which a numerically approximated trajectory corresponds to a true homoclinic orbit. This work also presents the first examples of computer-assisted proofs of gap solitons in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on non-perturbative parameter regimes.</description>

Abstract: We establish a complete characterization of multiplicative recurrence for images of the positive integers under M\"obius transformations, answering a question of Donoso--Le--Moreira--Sun in the negative. As a consequence, we strengthen and extend a Diophantine approximation result of Charamaras--Mountakis--Tsinas, confirming their conjectures.</description>

      <title>Interaction Identification of a Heterogeneous NDS with Quadratic-Bilinear Subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper attacks time-domain identification for interaction parameters of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear time-invariant (QBTI) model. The obtained results can also be applied to parameter estimations for a lumped QBTI system. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate. Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated generalized TFMs can in principle be estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from time-domain input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the NDS and the values of these generalized TFMs. A numerical example is included to illustrate characteristics of the suggested estimation algorithms.</description>
