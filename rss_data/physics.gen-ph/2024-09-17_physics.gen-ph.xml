      <title>Two-Time Relativistic Bohmian Model of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09049v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the recently presented Two-Time relativistic Bohmian Model (TTBM) is first rigorously and thoroughly summarized: definition, salient properties and observational explanations (double-slit experiment). Secondly, the theory is applied to a generic spherical atomic orbit, obtaining oscillations of the electron in the new time dimension, {\tau} , that demonstrate the static nature of the orbitals. Something very similar happens in the case of a particle in box, where {\tau}-oscillations cause the particle to spread out at steady states. Some speculations about spin and astrophysical follow. Finally, strengths and pending tasks of the model are summarized.</description>

      <title>Mass Oscillations in Superconducting Junctions for Gravitational Wave Emission and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the nonlinear superconducting junction dynamics in order to provide evidence that the time-dependent current density in the junction is related to an oscillating charge and mass density in addition to a variable velocity. As a result, the superconducting tunnel junction emerges as a solid state device capable of producing rapid charge and mass oscillations inaccessible in classical contexts. Rapidity is required for gravitational wave emission when small masses are involved in the emission process. We provide designs for an emitting and a detecting device based on generating and capturing mass oscillations with a non-zero quadrupole moment component. Finally, we suggest that the smallness of the Einstein gravitational coupling constant can be fully compensated by the largeness of the quantum mechanical term $e^4 \hbar^{-6}$ manifested in the suggested set ups.</description>

      <title>From new thermodynamics to classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The laws of classical mechanics are rebuilt in the frame of new thermodynamics. Heat is the sum of kinetic energy, system work, and system potential of gas, while force is the linear gradients of heat variation. Exporters and importers of force are evident in terms of exotherm and endotherm. Temperature and volume gradients create asymmetric forces driving rotation and spin (self-rotation). It verifies that force transfer does not need a medium. As an outstanding achievement, a succinct and general equation is derived to predict the equilibrium distance of molecular interaction without using any assumption, such as van der Waals force and dispersion force. In addition, the origins and attributes of repulsion and attraction are disclosed. Predicting results is applausive. For example, at 298 K, Le for N2, O2, and CH4 are 3.11, 3.11, and 3.68 A, comparable to the data adopted in MD simulations of the literature. Furthermore, the relationship between electricity and mass is established. An electron is characterized as a particle with a large {\alpha} dependent on the interaction distance. Two electrons are mutually attractive from a distance depending on temperature. The electromagnetic phenomena are integrated.</description>
