      <title>Optimal Strategy for Stabilizing Protein Folding Intermediates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To manipulate the protein population at certain functional state through chemical stabilizers is crucial for protein-related studies. It not only plays a key role in protein structure analysis and protein folding kinetics, but also affects protein functionality to a large extent and thus has wide applications in medicine, food industry, etc. However, due to concerns about side effects or financial costs of stabilizers, identifying optimal strategies for enhancing protein stability with a minimal amount of stabilizers is of great importance. Here we prove that either for the fixed terminal time (including both finite and infinite cases) or the free one, the optimal control strategy for stabilizing the folding intermediates with a linear strategy for stabilizer addition belongs to the class of Bang-Bang controls. The corresponding optimal switching time is derived analytically, whose phase diagram with respect to several key parameters is explored in detail. The Bang-Bang control will be broken when nonlinear strategies for stabilizer addition are adopted. Our current study on optimal strategies for protein stabilizers not only offers deep insights into the general picture of protein folding kinetics, but also provides valuable theoretical guidance on treatments for protein-related diseases in medicine.</description>

      <title>Counterions in RNA structure: Structural bioinformatics analysis to identify the role of Mg2+ ions in base pair formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contribution of metal ions on nucleic acids structures and functions is undeniable. Among the available metal ions like Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ etc., the role that play the Mg2+ ion is very significant related to the stability of the structures of RNA and this is quite well studied. But it is not possible to grasp the entire functionality of Mg2+ ion in the structure of RNA. So, to have a better understanding of the Mg-RNA complexes, in the present study, we have investigated 1541 non-redundant crystal structures of RNA and generated reports for various statistics related to these Mg-RNA complexes by computing base pairs and Mg2+ binding statistics. In this study, it has also been reported whether the presence of Mg2+ ions can alter the stability of base pairs or not by computing and comparing the base pairs stability. We noted that the Mg2+ ions do not affect the canonical base pair G:C W:WC while majority of the non-canonical base pair G:G W:HC, which is important also in DNA telomere structures, has Magnesium ion binding to O6 or N7 atoms of one of the Guanines.</description>

      <title>Programmable Lipid Nanoparticles for Precision Drug Delivery: A Four-Domain Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) offer precise spatiotemporal control over drug distribution and release, a critical advancement for treating complex diseases like cancer and genetic disorders. While existing reviews offer extensive insights into LNP development, this work introduces a novel model that dissects key components of LNP design, providing a framework to enhance the rational design of programmable LNPs. This review introduces a novel Four-Domain Model - Architecture, Interface, Payload, and Dispersal - providing a modular perspective that emphasizes the programmability of LNPs. We explore the dynamics between LNPs components and their environment throughout their lifecycle, focusing on thermodynamic stability during synthesis, storage, delivery, and drug release. Through these four distinct but interconnected domains, we introduce the concept of input stimuli, functional components, and output responses. This modular approach offers new perspectives for the rational design of programmable nanocarriers for exquisite control over payload release while minimizing off-target effects. Advances in bioinspired design principles could lead to LNPs that mimic natural biological systems, enhancing their biocompatibility and functionality. This review summarizes recent advancements, identifies challenges, and offers outlooks for programmable LNPs, emphasizing their potential to evolve into more intelligent, naturally integrated systems that enhance scalability and reduce side effects.</description>

      <title>CryoBench: Diverse and challenging datasets for the heterogeneity problem in cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique for determining high-resolution 3D biomolecular structures from imaging data. As this technique can capture dynamic biomolecular complexes, 3D reconstruction methods are increasingly being developed to resolve this intrinsic structural heterogeneity. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks with ground truth structures and validation metrics limits the advancement of the field. Here, we propose CryoBench, a suite of datasets, metrics, and performance benchmarks for heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM. We propose five datasets representing different sources of heterogeneity and degrees of difficulty. These include conformational heterogeneity generated from simple motions and random configurations of antibody complexes and from tens of thousands of structures sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation. We also design datasets containing compositional heterogeneity from mixtures of ribosome assembly states and 100 common complexes present in cells. We then perform a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art heterogeneous reconstruction tools including neural and non-neural methods and their sensitivity to noise, and propose new metrics for quantitative comparison of methods. We hope that this benchmark will be a foundational resource for analyzing existing methods and new algorithmic development in both the cryo-EM and machine learning communities.</description>

      <title>LipidBERT: A Lipid Language Model Pre-trained on METiS de novo Lipid Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we generate and maintain a database of 10 million virtual lipids through METiS's in-house de novo lipid generation algorithms and lipid virtual screening techniques. These virtual lipids serve as a corpus for pre-training, lipid representation learning, and downstream task knowledge transfer, culminating in state-of-the-art LNP property prediction performance. We propose LipidBERT, a BERT-like model pre-trained with the Masked Language Model (MLM) and various secondary tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of embeddings generated by LipidBERT and PhatGPT, our GPT-like lipid generation model, on downstream tasks. The proposed bilingual LipidBERT model operates in two languages: the language of ionizable lipid pre-training, using in-house dry-lab lipid structures, and the language of LNP fine-tuning, utilizing in-house LNP wet-lab data. This dual capability positions LipidBERT as a key AI-based filter for future screening tasks, including new versions of METiS de novo lipid libraries and, more importantly, candidates for in vivo testing for orgran-targeting LNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of the capability of a pre-trained language model on virtual lipids and its effectiveness in downstream tasks using web-lab data. This work showcases the clever utilization of METiS's in-house de novo lipid library as well as the power of dry-wet lab integration.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Molecular Processing Pipeline for Generating Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models for molecules have shown considerable promise for use in computational chemistry, but remain difficult to use for non-experts. For this reason, we introduce open-source infrastructure for easily building generative molecular models into the widely used DeepChem [Ramsundar et al., 2019] library with the aim of creating a robust and reusable molecular generation pipeline. In particular, we add high quality PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019] implementations of the Molecular Generative Adversarial Networks (MolGAN) [Cao and Kipf, 2022] and Normalizing Flows [Papamakarios et al., 2021]. Our implementations show strong performance comparable with past work [Kuznetsov and Polykovskiy, 2021, Cao and Kipf, 2022].</description>

      <title>PepMLM: Target Sequence-Conditioned Generation of Therapeutic Peptide Binders via Span Masked Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target proteins that lack accessible binding pockets and conformational stability have posed increasing challenges for drug development. Induced proximity strategies, such as PROTACs and molecular glues, have thus gained attention as pharmacological alternatives, but still require small molecule docking at binding pockets for targeted protein degradation. The computational design of protein-based binders presents unique opportunities to access "undruggable" targets, but have often relied on stable 3D structures or structure-influenced latent spaces for effective binder generation. In this work, we introduce PepMLM, a target sequence-conditioned generator of de novo linear peptide binders. By employing a novel span masking strategy that uniquely positions cognate peptide sequences at the C-terminus of target protein sequences, PepMLM fine-tunes the state-of-the-art ESM-2 pLM to fully reconstruct the binder region, achieving low perplexities matching or improving upon validated peptide-protein sequence pairs. After successful in silico benchmarking with AlphaFold-Multimer, outperforming RFDiffusion on structured targets, we experimentally verify PepMLM's efficacy via fusion of model-derived peptides to E3 ubiquitin ligase domains, demonstrating endogenous degradation of emergent viral phosphoproteins and Huntington's disease-driving proteins. In total, PepMLM enables the generative design of candidate binders to any target protein, without the requirement of target structure, empowering downstream therapeutic applications.</description>

      <title>Undesignable RNA Structure Identification via Rival Structure Generation and Structure Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RNA design is the search for a sequence or set of sequences that will fold into predefined structures, also known as the inverse problem of RNA folding. While numerous RNA design methods have been invented to find sequences capable of folding into a target structure, little attention has been given to the identification of undesignable structures according to the minimum free energy (MFE) criterion under the Turner model. In this paper, we address this gap by first introducing mathematical theorems outlining sufficient conditions for recognizing undesignable structures, then proposing efficient algorithms, guided by these theorems, to verify the undesignability of RNA structures. Through the application of these theorems and algorithms to the Eterna100 puzzles, we demonstrate the ability to efficiently establish that 15 of the puzzles indeed fall within the category of undesignable structures. In addition, we provide specific insights from the study of undesignability, in the hope that it will enable more understanding of RNA folding and RNA design.</description>
