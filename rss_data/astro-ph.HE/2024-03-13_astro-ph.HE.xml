      <title>Superphot+: Realtime Fitting and Classification of Supernova Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric classifications of supernova (SN) light curves have become necessary to utilize the full potential of large samples of observations obtained from wide-field photometric surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Here, we present a photometric classifier for SN light curves that does not rely on redshift information and still maintains comparable accuracy to redshift-dependent classifiers. Our new package, Superphot+, uses a parametric model to extract meaningful features from multiband SN light curves. We train a gradient-boosted machine with fit parameters from 6,061 ZTF SNe that pass data quality cuts and are spectroscopically classified as one of five classes: SN Ia, SN II, SN Ib/c, SN IIn, and SLSN-I. Without redshift information, our classifier yields a class-averaged F1-score of 0.61 +/- 0.02 and a total accuracy of 0.83 +/- 0.01. Including redshift information improves these metrics to 0.71 +/- 0.02 and 0.88 +/- 0.01, respectively. We assign new class probabilities to 3,558 ZTF transients that show SN-like characteristics (based on the ALeRCE Broker light curve and stamp classifiers), but lack spectroscopic classifications. Finally, we compare our predicted SN labels with those generated by the ALeRCE light curve classifier, finding that the two classifiers agree on photometric labels for 82 +/- 2% of light curves with spectroscopic labels and 72% of light curves without spectroscopic labels. Superphot+ is currently classifying ZTF SNe in real time via the ANTARES Broker, and is designed for simple adaptation to six-band Rubin light curves in the future.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Feedback on Bi-stable ISM Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being energetically important, the effect of cosmic rays on the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) is assumed to be negligible because the cosmic ray energy diffusion coefficient parallel to the magnetic field is relatively large. Using numerical simulations, we explore how variation of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient as a function of gas temperature could impact the dynamics of the ISM. We create a two-zone model of cosmic ray transport, reflecting the strong damping of the small scale magnetic field fluctuations, which scatter the cosmic rays, in a gas with low ionization. The variable diffusion coefficient allows more cold gas to form. However, setting the diffusion coefficient at a critical value in the warm phase allows the cosmic rays to adjust the kinetic energy cascade. Specifically, we show the slope of the cascade changes for motion perpendicular to the mean magnetic field, whereas kinetic energy parallel to the magnetic field is reduced equally across inertial scales. We show that cosmic ray energization (or reacceleration) comes at the expense of total radiated energy generated during the formation of a cold cloud. We also show that our two-zone model of cosmic ray transport is capable of matching estimates of the grammage for some paths through the simulation, but full comparison of the grammage requires simulating turbulence in a larger volume.</description>

      <title>Latest Evolution of the X-Ray Remnant of SN 1987A: Beyond the Inner Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on our Chandra imaging-spectroscopic observations, we present the latest evolution of the X-ray remnant of SN 1987A. Recent changes in the electron temperatures and volume emission measures suggest that the blast wave in SN 1987A is moving out of the dense inner ring structure, also called the equatorial ring (ER). The 0.5-2.0 keV X-ray light curve shows a linearly declining trend (by $\sim$4.5 % yr$^{-1}$) between 2016 and 2020, as the blast wave heats the hitherto unknown circumstellar medium (CSM) outside the ER. While the peak X-ray emission in the latest 0.3-8.0 keV image is still within the ER, the radial expansion rate in the 3.0-8.0 keV images suggests an increasing contribution of the X-ray emission from less dense CSM since 2012, at least partly from beyond the ER. It is remarkable that, since 2020, the declining soft X-ray flux has stabilized around $\sim$7 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, which may signal a contribution from the reverse-shocked outer layers of ejecta as predicted by the 3-D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models. In the latest ACIS spectrum of supernova remnant (SNR) 1987A in 2022 we report a significant detection of the Fe K line at $\sim$6.7 keV, which may be due to changing thermal conditions of the X-ray emitting CSM and/or the onset of reverse shock interactions with the Fe-ejecta.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: an ultra-stripped, nickel-poor supernova from a low-mass progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $&lt;$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($&lt; 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.</description>

      <title>The long-term evolution of the GW170817 remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW170817 represents the first observed binary neutron star merger event by humanity. The observation of GW170817 has identified the correlation between Kilonova, gravitational wave and short GRB. The shocks from GW170817 have the capacity to inject significant thermal and kinetic energies into the interstellar medium and evolve for over a million years. In this letter, we adopt the special relativity fluid dynamics equations to simulate the evolution of the GW170817 remnant over a span of one million years. Our simulations yield the evolution profiles of the velocity, density, mass, radius, luminosity, and energies of the remnant. We estimate that the GW170817 remnant will reach the average maximum luminosity $ 2.56\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$at approximately $3.96\times 10^4$ yr. At the end of the cooling stage, the contaminated radius and mass are $48.35$ pc and $2.25\times 10^4 M_{\odot}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Annihilation of positrons from AGN jets as a possible source of cosmic gamma-ray background at energies below 511 keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the diffuse gamma-ray background in the range from hundreds keV to several MeV is not known conclusively. From current models and observations it is believed that, at least partially, this background is formed by blazars and remnants of supernovae (SN) of type Ia in distant galaxies. However, these contributions are not sufficient to reproduce the observed level of the signal. In this work we propose another source which could contribute to this background, namely the jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The composition of jets is not known, but there are observational hints that the fraction of positrons there is substantial. Positrons are partially evacuated to the intergalactic medium and partially mix with the circumgalactic medium and annihilate there comparatively quickly. Using the AGN luminosity function, we estimated the positron production rate and the contribution of the positron annihilation to the cosmic background below 511 keV. We also estimated the analogous contribution from positron annihilation within SN Ia remnants in distant galaxies. The contribution of AGNs is estimated to be a factor of 5 - 10 smaller than the observed background intensity, and the contribution from SNe is yet smaller by one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the contribution of AGNs appeared to be larger than the contribution of blazars estimated from Swift-BAT and Fermi-LAT observations. The main uncertainty in our model is the fraction of positrons remaining in the circumgalactic medium which makes our estimation an upper limit.</description>

      <title>Comparing jet-shaped point symmetry in cluster cooling flows and supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I point out similarities between point-symmetric X-ray morphologies in cooling flow groups and clusters of galaxies, which are observed to be shaped by jets, and point-symmetric morphologies of eight core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnants. I use these similarities to strengthen the jittering jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, which predicts that the last pairs of jets to be launched by the newly born neutron star might shape some CCSN remnants to point-symmetric morphology. The point-symmetric morphologies in both types of objects are composed of two or more pairs of opposite bubbles (cavities), nozzles, some clumps, small protrusions (termed ears), and rims. The typically large volume of a CCSN remnant shaped by jets implies that the shaping jets carry an energy comparable to that of the ejecta, which in turn implies that jets exploded the remnant's massive star progenitor. The morphological similarities studied here add to the similarity of CCSN remnants, not only point-symmetric ones, to planetary nebulae shaped by jets. Together, these similarities solidify the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe. I consider the identification of point-symmetry in CCSNe, as expected by jet-shaping in the JJEM, to be the most severe challenge to the competing neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. I reiterate my earlier claim, but in a more vocal voice, that the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe is the JJEM.</description>

      <title>Narrowly-Banded Spectra with Peak Frequency Around 1 GHz of FRB 20201124A: Implications for Energy Function and Radiation Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation physics of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains an open question. Current observations have discovered that narrowly-banded bursts of FRB 20201124A are active in 0.4-2 GHz and their spectral peak frequency ($\nu^{\rm obs}_{p}$) are mostly toward $\sim 1$ GHz. Utilizing a sample of 1268 bursts of FRB 20201124A detected with the FAST telescope, we show that the $1\sigma$ spectral regime of 71.4\% events (in-band bursts) is within the FAST bandpass. Their intrinsic burst energies ($E^{\rm obs}_{\rm BWe}$) and spectral widths ($\sigma_s^{\rm obs}$) are well measured by fitting the spectral profile with a Gaussian function. The derived $E^{\rm obs}_{\rm BWe}$ and $\sigma_s^{\rm obs}$ distributions are log-normal and centering at $\log E^{\rm obs}_{\rm BWe}/{\rm erg}=37.2~ (\sigma=0.76)$ and $\log \sigma_s^{\rm obs}/{\rm GHz}=-1.16~ (\sigma=0.17)$. Our Monte Carlo simulation analysis infers its intrinsic $\nu_p$ distribution as a normal function centered at $\nu_{p,c}=1.16$ GHz ($\sigma=0.22$) and its intrinsic energy function as $\Phi(E)\propto E^{-0.60}e^{-E/E_c}$ with $E_c=9.49 \times 10^{37}$ erg. We compare these results with that of typical repeating FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B that are active over a broad frequency range at several specific frequencies and discuss possible observational biases on the estimation of the event rate and energy function. Based on these results, we argue that FRB 20201124A likely occurs in a fine-tuned plasma for maser radiations at a narrow frequency range, while FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B could involve clumpy plasma conditions that make maser emission around several specific frequencies in a broad range.</description>

      <title>Effect of Earth's Oblateness on Black Hole Imaging Through Earth-Space and Space-Space VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth-based Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has made rapid advances in imaging black holes. However, due to the limitations imposed on terrestrial VLBI by the Earth's finite size and turbulent atmosphere, it is imperative to have a space-based component in future VLBI missions. Herein, this paper investigates the effect of Earth's oblateness, also known as the $J_{2}$ effect, on orbiters in Earth-Space and Space-Space VLBI. The paper provides an extensive discussion on how the $J_{2}$ effect can directly impact orbit selection for black hole observations and how through informed choices of orbital parameters, the effect can be used to the mission's advantage, a fact that has not been addressed in existing space-VLBI investigations. We provide a comprehensive study of how the orbital parameters of several current space VLBI proposals will vary specifically due to the $J_{2}$ effect. For black hole accretion flow targets of interest, we have demonstrated how the $J_{2}$ effect leads to modest increase in shorter baseline coverage, filling gaps in the $(u,v)$ plane. Subsequently, we construct a simple analytical formalism that allows isolation of the impact of the $J_{2}$ effect on the $(u,v)$ plane without requiring computationally intensive orbit propagation simulations. By directly constructing $(u,v)$ coverage using the $J_{2}$ affected and invariant equations of motion, we obtain distinct coverage patterns for M87* and SgrA* that show extremely dense coverage on short baselines as well as long term orbital stability on longer baselines.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Description of Electron Thermalization in Kilonovae Ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple analytic description is provided of the rate of energy deposition by $\beta$-decay electrons in the homologously expanding radioactive plasma ejected in neutron star mergers, valid for a wide range of ejecta parameters -- initial entropy, electron fraction $\{s_0,Y_e\}$ and density $\rho t^3$. The formulae are derived using detailed numerical calculations following the time-dependent composition and $\beta$-decay emission spectra (including the effect of delayed deposition). The deposition efficiency depends mainly on $\rho t^3$ and only weakly on $\{s_0,Y_e\}$. The time $t_e$ at which the ratio between the rates of electron energy deposition and energy production drops to $1-e^{-1}$, is given by $t_e=t_{0e}\Big(\frac{\rho t^3}{0.5(\rho t^3)_0}\Big)^a$, where $(\rho t^3)_0=\frac{0.05M_{\odot}}{4\pi(0.2c)^3}$, $t_{0e}(s_0,Y_e)\approx17$ days and $0.4\le a(s_0,Y_e)\le0.5$. The fractional uncertainty in $t_e$ due to nuclear physics uncertainties is $\approx10\%$. The result $a\le0.5$ reflects the fact that the characteristic $\beta$-decay electron energies do not decrease with time (largely due to "inverted decay chains" in which a slowly-decaying isotope decays to a rapidly-decaying isotope with higher end-point energy). We provide an analytic approximation for the time-dependent electron energy deposition rate, reproducing the numerical results to better than $50\%$ (typically $&lt;30\%$, well within the energy production rate uncertainty due to nuclear physics uncertainties) over a 3-4 orders-of-magnitude deposition rate decrease with time. Our results may be easily incorporated in calculations of kilonovae light curves (with general density and composition structures), eliminating the need to numerically follow the time-dependent electron spectra. Identifying $t_e$, e.g. in the bolometric light curve, will constrain the (properly averaged) ejecta $\rho t^3$.</description>

      <title>The thermalization of $\gamma$-rays in radioactive expanding ejecta: A simple model and its application for Kilonovae and Ia SNe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-analytic approximation is derived for the time-dependent fraction $f_\gamma(t)$ of the energy deposited by radioactive decay $\gamma$-rays in a homologously expanding plasma of general structure. An analytic approximation is given for spherically symmetric plasma distributions. Applied to Kilonovae (KNe) associated with neutron stars mergers and Type Ia supernovae, our semi-analytic and analytic approximations reproduce, with a few percent and 10% accuracy, respectively, the energy deposition rates, $\dot{Q}_\text{dep}$, obtained in numeric Monte Carlo calculations. The time $t_\gamma$ beyond which $\gamma$-ray deposition is inefficient is determined by an effective frequency-independent $\gamma$-ray opacity $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$, $t_\gamma = \sqrt{\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}\langle\Sigma\rangle t^2}$, where $\langle\Sigma\rangle\propto t^{-2}$ is the average plasma column density. For $\beta$-decay dominated energy release, $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$ is typically close to the effective Compton scattering opacity, $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}} \approx 0.025~{\rm {cm}^{2}\,g^{-1}}$ with a weak dependence on composition. For KNe, $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$ depends mainly on the initial electron fraction $Y_e$, $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}} \approx 0.03(0.05)~{\rm {cm}^{2}\,g^{-1}}$ for $Y_e \gtrsim (\lesssim) 0.25$ (in contrast with earlier work that found $\kappa_{\gamma,\text{eff}}$ larger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low $Y_e$), and is insensitive to the (large) nuclear physics uncertainties. Determining $t_\gamma$ from observations will therefore measure the ejecta $\langle\Sigma\rangle t^2$, providing a stringent test of models. For $\langle\Sigma\rangle t^2=2\times10^{11}~{\rm g\,{cm}^{-2}\,s^2}$, a typical value expected for KNe, $t_\gamma\approx1$ d.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization for Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in gravitational-wave interferometers, particularly the next generation, are poised to profoundly impact gravitational wave astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics. A hybrid quantum algorithm is proposed to carry out quantum inference of parameters from compact binary coalescences detected in gravitational-wave interferometers. It performs quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization and Downsampling (qBIRD). We choose binary black hole (BBH) mergers from LIGO observatories as the first case to test the algorithm, but its application can be extended to more general instances. The quantum algorithm is able to generate corner plots of relevant parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, spins, etc. by inference of simulated gravitational waves with known injected parameter values with zero noise, Gaussian noise and real data, thus recovering an accuracy equivalent to that of classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo inferences. The simulations are performed with sets of 2 and 4 parameters. These results enhance the possibilities to extend our capacity to track signals from coalescences over longer durations and at lower frequencies extending the accuracy and promptness of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative correction on the black hole geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the holographic principle to obtain a modified metric of black holes that reproduces the exponentially corrected entropy. The exponential correction of the black hole entropy comes from non-perturbative corrections. It interprets as a quantum effect which affects black hole thermodynamics especially in the infinitesimal scales. Hence, it may affect black hole stability at the final stage. Then, we study modified thermodynamics due to the non-perturbative corrections and calculate thermodynamics quantities of several non-rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Final state radiation from high and ultrahigh energy neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged leptons produced by high-energy and ultrahigh-energy neutrinos have a substantial probability of emitting prompt internal bremsstrahlung $\nu_\ell + N \rightarrow \ell + X + \gamma$. This can have important consequences for neutrino detection. We discuss observable consequences at high- and ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes and LHC's Forward Physics Facility. Logarithmic enhancements can be substantial (e.g.\ $\sim 20\%$) when either the charged lepton's energy, or the rest of the cascade, is measured. We comment on applications involving the inelasticity distribution including measurements of the $\nu/\bar{\nu}$ flux ratio, throughgoing muons, and double-bang signatures for high-energy neutrino observation. Furthermore, for ultrahigh-energy neutrino observation, we find that final state radiation affects flavor measurements and decreases the energy of both Earth-emergent tau leptons and regenerated tau neutrinos. Finally, for LHC's Forward Physics Facility, we find that final state radiation will impact future extractions of strange quark parton distribution functions. Final state radiation should be included in future analyses at neutrino telescopes and the Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES -- XII. Time-delay Measurements of Strongly Lensed Type Ia Supernovae using a Long Short-Term Memory Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) are a promising probe to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$) directly. To use LSNe Ia for cosmography, a time-delay measurement between the multiple images, a lens-mass model, and a mass reconstruction along the line of sight are required. In this work, we present the machine learning network LSTM-FCNN which is a combination of a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and a fully-connected neural network (FCNN). The LSTM-FCNN is designed to measure time delays on a sample of LSNe Ia spanning a broad range of properties, which we expect to find with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and for which follow-up observations are planned. With follow-up observations in $i$ band (cadence of one to three days with a single-epoch $5\sigma$ depth of 24.5 mag), we reach a bias-free delay measurement with a precision around 0.7 days over a large sample of LSNe Ia. The LSTM-FCNN is far more general than previous machine learning approaches such as the Random Forest (RF), where a RF has to be trained for each observational pattern separately, and yet the LSTM-FCNN outperforms the RF by a factor of roughly three. Therefore, the LSTM-FCNN is a very promising approach to achieve robust time delays in LSNe Ia, which is important for a precise and accurate constraint on $H_0$</description>

      <title>Coupling between magnetic reconnection, energy release, and particle acceleration in the X17.2 2003 October 28 solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2003 October 28 (X17.2) eruptive flare was a unique event. The coronal electric field and the {\pi}-decay {\gamma}-ray emission flux had the highest values ever inferred in solar flares. This study reveals physical links between the magnetic reconnection process, the energy release, and the acceleration of electrons and ions to high energies in the chain of the magnetic energy transformations in the impulsive phase of the solar flare. The global reconnection rate and the local reconnection rate are calculated from flare ribbon separation in H{\alpha} filtergrams and photospheric magnetic field maps. Available results of INTEGRAL and CORONAS-F/SONG observations are combined with Konus-Wind data to quantify time behavior of electron and proton acceleration. Prompt {\gamma}-ray lines and delayed 2.2 MeV line temporal profiles observed with Konus-Wind and INTEGRAL/SPI used to detect and quantify the nuclei with energies of 10-70 MeV. The global and local reconnection rates reach their peaks at the end of the main rise phase of the flare. The spectral analysis of the high-energy {\gamma}-ray emission revealed a close association between the acceleration process efficiency and the reconnection rates. High-energy bremsstrahlung continuum and narrow {\gamma}-ray lines were observed in the main rise phase. In the main energy release phase, the upper energy of the bremsstrahlung spectrum was significantly reduced and the pion-decay {\gamma}-ray emission appeared abruptly. We discuss the reasons why the change of the acceleration regime occurred along with the large-scale magnetic field restructuration of this flare. We argue that the main energy release and proton acceleration up to subrelativistic energies began just when the reconnection rate was going through the maximum, i.e., after a major change of the flare topology.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the charge ratio and polarization of cosmic-ray muons with the Super-Kamiokande detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the charge ratio ($R$) and polarization ($P^{\mu}_{0}$) measurements using the decay electron events collected from 2008 September to 2022 June by the Super-Kamiokande detector. Because of its underground location and long operation, we performed high precision measurements by accumulating cosmic-ray muons. We measured the muon charge ratio to be $R=1.32 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at $E_{\mu}\cos \theta_{\mathrm{Zenith}}=0.7^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ $\mathrm{TeV}$, where $E_{\mu}$ is the muon energy and $\theta_{\mathrm{Zenith}}$ is the zenith angle of incoming cosmic-ray muons. This result is consistent with the Honda flux model while this suggests a tension with the $\pi K$ model of $1.9\sigma$. We also measured the muon polarization at the production location to be $P^{\mu}_{0}=0.52 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at the muon momentum of $0.9^{+0.6}_{-0.1}$ $\mathrm{TeV}/c$ at the surface of the mountain; this also suggests a tension with the Honda flux model of $1.5\sigma$. This is the most precise measurement ever to experimentally determine the cosmic-ray muon polarization near $1~\mathrm{TeV}/c$. These measurement results are useful to improve the atmospheric neutrino simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards a Consistent Calculation of the Lunar Response to Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent increasing interest in detecting gravitational waves (GWs) by lunar seismic measurement urges us to have a clear understanding of the response of the moon to passing GWs. In this paper, we clarify the relationship between two seemly different response functions which have been derived previously using two different methods, one taking the field-theory approach and the other using the tidal force induced by GWs. We revisit their derivation and prove, by both analytical arguments and numerical calculations, that the two response functions are equivalent. Their apparent difference can be attributed to the choice of different coordinates. Using the correct response function, we calculate the sensitivities (to GWs) of several designed lunar seismometers, and find that the sensitivity curves between $10^{-3}$ and $0.1$ Hz are much flatter than the previous calculations based on normal-mode model. Our results will help clarifying the scientific objectives of lunar GW observation, as well as provide important constraints on the design of lunar GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Wave Dark Matter with Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) can detect disturbances in the fabric of spacetime on a galactic scale by monitoring the arrival time of pulses from millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Recent advancements have enabled the use of $\gamma$-ray radiation emitted by MSPs, in addition to radio waves, for PTA experiments. Wave dark matter (DM), a prominent class of DM candidates, can be detected with PTAs due to its periodic perturbations of the spacetime metric. In response to this development, we perform in this Letter a first analysis of applying the $\gamma$-ray PTA to detect the ultralight axion-like wave DM, with the data of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Despite its much smaller collecting area, the Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray PTA demonstrates a promising sensitivity potential. We show that the upper limits not far from those of the dedicated radio-PTA projects can be achieved. Moreover, we initiate a cross-correlation analysis using the data of two Fermi-LAT pulsars. The cross-correlation of phases, while carrying key information on the source of the spacetime perturbations, has been ignored in the existing data analyses for the wave DM detection with PTAs. Our analysis indicates that taking this information into account can improve the sensitivity to wave DM by $\gtrsim 50\%$ at masses below $10^{-23}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Long-rising Type II Supernovae in the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN 1987A was an unusual hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova originating from a blue supergiant star. Similar blue supergiant explosions remain a small family of events, and are broadly characterized by their long rises to peak. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment aims to construct a spectroscopically complete sample of transients occurring in galaxies from the CLU galaxy catalog. We identify 13 long-rising (&gt;40 days) Type II supernovae from the volume-limited CLU experiment during a 3.5 year period from June 2018 to December 2021, approximately doubling the previously known number of these events. We present photometric and spectroscopic data of these 13 events, finding peak r-band absolute magnitudes ranging from -15.6 to -17.5 mag and the tentative detection of Ba II lines in 9 events. Using our CLU sample of events, we derive a long-rising Type II supernova rate of $1.37^{+0.26}_{-0.30}\times10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, $\approx$1.4% of the total core-collapse supernova rate. This is the first volumetric rate of these events estimated from a large, systematic, volume-limited experiment.</description>

      <title>Science with a small two-band UV-photometry mission III: Active Galactic Nuclei and nuclear transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review (the third in the series focused on a small two-band UV-photometry mission), we assess possibilities for a small UV two-band photometry mission in studying accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs; mass range $\sim 10^6$-$10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$). We focus on the following observational concepts: (i) dedicated monitoring of selected type-I Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in order to measure the time delay between the far-UV, the near-UV, and other wavebands (X-ray and optical), (ii) nuclear transients including (partial) tidal disruption events and repetitive nuclear transients, and (iii) the study of peculiar sources, such as changing-look AGN, hollows and gaps in accretion disks, low-luminosity AGN, and candidates for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs; mass range $\sim 10^2$-$10^5\,M_{\odot}$) in galactic nuclei. For tidal disruption events (TDEs), high-cadence UV monitoring is crucial for distinguishing among different scenarios for the origin of the UV emission. The small two-band UV space telescope will also provide the information about the near- and far-UV continuum variability for rare transients, such as repetitive partial TDEs and jetted TDEs. We also discuss the possibilities to study and analyze sources with non-standard accretion flows, such as AGN with gappy disks, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei with intermittent accretion, and SMBH binaries potentially involving intermediate-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the gamma-ray and high energy neutrino fluxes from the circumstellar interaction of SN 2023ixf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent supernova, SN 2023ixf, one of the closest observed type II SNe has revealed the presence of a dense circumstellar material (CSM). Interaction of the SN ejecta with this dense CSM might create high energy protons of PeV energies through shock acceleration. These accelerated protons then colliding with the CSM (inelastic $pp$ collision) can produce secondaries such as high energy gamma-rays and neutrinos. However, no gamma-rays and neutrinos have been detected by Fermi-LAT and IceCube from this event. Fermi-LAT has placed an upper limit on the gamma-ray flux above $100$~MeV to be $2.6 \times 10^{-11}~\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. On the other hand, IceCube's upper limit on muon neutrino flux is $7.3\times 10^{-2} ~\rm GeV~cm^{-2}$. {\color{black} Taking these limits into account and using the shock-CSM properties derived from multi-wavelength observations, we obtain new upper limits on the gamma-ray ($10^{-11}~\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$) and neutrino ($10^{-3}~\rm GeV~cm^{-2}$) fluxes from SN 2023ixf produced via the $pp$ interaction channel.} While we found the gamma-ray flux to be consistent with Fermi-LAT's upper limit, the neutrino flux is found to be about $2$ orders of magnitude smaller than the IceCube's upper limit. We further analyse the detection prospects of such secondary signals from future SN 2023 like events with upcoming detectors, CTA and IceCube-Gen2 and found to have great discovery potential, if any similar event occurs within $7$ Mpc.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Simulations of Double Detonation Type Ia Supernova to Integration Methodology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions in simulations of the double detonation model for Type Ia supernovae. When assessing the convergence of simulations, the focus is usually on spatial resolution; however, the method of coupling the physics together as well as the tolerances used in integrating a reaction network also play an important role. In this paper, we explore how the choices made in both coupling and integrating the reaction portion of a simulation (operator / Strang splitting vs.\ the simplified spectral deferred corrections method we introduced previously) influences the accuracy, efficiency, and the nucleosynthesis of simulations of double detonations. We find no need to limit reaction rates or reduce the simulation timestep to the reaction timescale. The entire simulation methodology used here is GPU-accelerated and made freely available as part of the Castro simulation code.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Model For Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04507</link>

Abstract: Recent numerical cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical-star formation simulations have resolved the formation of quasar accretion disks with Eddington or super-Eddington accretion rates onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) down to a few hundred gravitational radii. These 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks appear to be qualitatively distinct from classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks: the midplane pressure is dominated by toroidal magnetic fields with plasma $\beta \ll 1$ powered by advection of magnetic flux from the interstellar medium (ISM), and they are super-sonically and trans-Alfvenically turbulent with cooling times short compared to dynamical times yet remain gravitationally stable owing to magnetic support. In this paper, we present a simple analytic similarity model for such disks. For reasonable assumptions, the model is entirely specified by the boundary conditions (inflow rate at the BH radius of influence [BHROI]). We show that the scalings from this model are robust to various detailed assumptions, agree remarkably well with the simulations (given their simplicity), and demonstrate the self-consistency and gravitational stability of such disks even in the outer accretion disk (approaching the BHROI) at hyper-Eddington accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Physical Correlations and Predictions Emerging from Modern Core-Collapse Supernova Theory</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive correlations between core-collapse supernova observables and progenitor core structures that emerge from our suite of twenty state-of-the-art 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times. This is the largest such collection of 3D supernova models ever generated and allows one to witness and derive testable patterns that might otherwise be obscured when studying one or a few models in isolation. From this panoramic perspective, we have discovered correlations between explosion energy, neutron star gravitational birth masses, $^{56}$Ni and $\alpha$-rich freeze-out yields, and pulsar kicks and theoretically important correlations with the compactness parameter of progenitor structure. We find a correlation between explosion energy and progenitor mantle binding energy, suggesting that such explosions are self-regulating. We also find a testable correlation between explosion energy and measures of explosion asymmetry, such as the ejecta energy and mass dipoles. While the correlations between two observables are roughly independent of the progenitor ZAMS mass, the many correlations we derive with compactness can not unambiguously be tied to a particular progenitor ZAMS mass. This relationship depends upon the compactness/ZAMS mass mapping associated with the massive star progenitor models employed. Therefore, our derived correlations between compactness and observables may be more robust than with ZAMS mass, but can nevertheless be used in the future once massive star modeling has converged.</description>

      <title>Performance of SK-Gd's Upgraded Real-time Supernova Monitoring System</title>

Abstract: Among multi-messenger observations of the next galactic core-collapse supernova, Super-Kamiokande (SK) plays a critical role in detecting the emitted supernova neutrinos, determining the direction to the supernova (SN), and notifying the astronomical community of these observations in advance of the optical signal. On 2022, SK has increased the gadolinium dissolved in its water target (SK-Gd) and has achieved a Gd concentration of 0.033%, resulting in enhanced neutron detection capability, which in turn enables more accurate determination of the supernova direction. Accordingly, SK-Gd's real-time supernova monitoring system (Abe te al. 2016b) has been upgraded. SK_SN Notice, a warning system that works together with this monitoring system, was released on December 13, 2021, and is available through GCN Notices (Barthelmy et al. 2000). When the monitoring system detects an SN-like burst of events, SK_SN Notice will automatically distribute an alarm with the reconstructed direction to the supernova candidate within a few minutes. In this paper, we present a systematic study of SK-Gd's response to a simulated galactic SN. Assuming a supernova situated at 10 kpc, neutrino fluxes from six supernova models are used to characterize SK-Gd's pointing accuracy using the same tools as the online monitoring system. The pointing accuracy is found to vary from 3-7$^\circ$ depending on the models. However, if the supernova is closer than 10 kpc, SK_SN Notice can issue an alarm with three-degree accuracy, which will benefit follow-up observations by optical telescopes with large fields of view.</description>

      <title>Momentum Shell in Quarkyonic Matter from Explicit Duality: A Dual Model for Cold, Dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model of cold QCD matter that bridges nuclear and quark matter through the duality relation between quarks and baryons. The baryon number and energy densities are expressed as functionals of either the baryon momentum distribution, $f_{\rm B}$, or the quark distribution, $f_{\rm Q}$, which are subject to the constraints on fermions, $0 \le f_{\rm B,Q} \le 1$. The theory is ideal in the sense that the confinement of quarks into baryons is reflected in the duality relation between $f_{\rm Q}$ and $f_{\rm B}$, while other possible interactions among quarks and baryons are all neglected. The variational problem with the duality constraints is formulated and we explicitly construct analytic solutions, finding two distinct regimes: A nuclear matter regime at low density and a Quarkyonic regime at high density. In the Quarkyonic regime, baryons underoccupy states at low momenta but form a momentum shell with $f_{\rm B}=1$ on top of a quark Fermi sea. Such a theory describes a rapid transition from a soft nuclear equation of state to a stiff Quarkyonic equation of state. At this transition, there is a rapid increase in the pressure.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in FIRE: Resolving the End of Star Formation and Structure of AGN Accretion Disks from Cosmological Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13115</link>

Abstract: It has recently become possible to zoom-in from cosmological to sub-pc scales in galaxy simulations to follow accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, at some point the approximations used on ISM scales (e.g. optically-thin cooling and stellar-population-integrated star formation [SF] and feedback [FB]) break down. We therefore present the first cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation which self-consistently combines the FIRE physics (relevant on galactic/ISM scales where SF/FB are ensemble-averaged) and STARFORGE physics (relevant on small scales where we track individual (proto)stellar formation and evolution), together with explicit RMHD (including non-ideal MHD and multi-band M1-RHD) which self-consistently treats both optically-thick and thin regimes. This allows us to span scales from ~100 Mpc down to &lt;100 au (~300 Schwarzschild radii) around a SMBH at a time where it accretes as a bright quasar, in a single simulation. We show that accretion rates up to $\sim 10-100\,{\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ can be sustained into the accretion disk at $\ll 10^{3}\,R_{\rm schw}$, with gravitational torques between stars and gas dominating on sub-kpc scales until star formation is shut down on sub-pc scales by a combination of optical depth to cooling and strong magnetic fields. There is an intermediate-scale, flux-frozen disk which is gravitoturbulent and stabilized by magnetic pressure sustaining strong turbulence and inflow with persistent spiral modes. In this paper we focus on how gas gets into the small-scale disk, and how star formation is efficiently suppressed.</description>

      <title>MeV gamma rays from Q-ball decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric Q balls which decay at present and find that they create a distinctive spectrum of gamma rays at around O(10) MeV. The charge of the Q ball is lepton numbers in order for the lifetime to be as long as the present age of the universe, and the main decay products are light leptons. However, as the charge of the Q ball decreases, the decay channel into pions becomes kinematically allowed towards the end of the decay, and the pions are produced at rest. Immediately, $\pi^0$ decays into two photons with the energy of 67.5 MeV, half the pion mass, which exhibits a unique emission line. In addition, $\pi^\pm$ decay into $\mu^\pm$, which further decay with emitting internal bremsstrahlung, whose spectrum has a sharp cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV. If the observations would find these peculiar features of the gamma-ray spectrum in the future, it could be a smoking gun of the supersymmetric Q-ball decay at present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the pioneering contributions of Thomas K. Gaisser to the birth and development of particle astrophysics, a new field of research at the intersection of cosmic ray physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and particle physics that has emerged in the last few decades. We will especially focus on his studies of natural beams of neutrinos: those generated by the interactions of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere and those emitted by astrophysical sources. Tom actively participated in the discovery of these cosmic neutrinos as well. His contributions also extend to gamma-ray astronomy, the study of the cosmic ray spectra and composition, and the modeling of cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere and in astrophysical environments. Tom invariably focused his research on the theoretical and phenomenological problems of greatest interest at the time, producing frameworks that transparently interpreted often complex data. These studies have been very influential and have shaped the development of the field.</description>
