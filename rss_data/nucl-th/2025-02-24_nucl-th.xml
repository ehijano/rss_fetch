      <title>Hypernuclear cluster states of $_\Lambda^{12}\rm{B}$ Unveiled through Neural Network-Driven Microscopic Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hypernuclear cluster states of $_\Lambda^{12}\mathrm{B}$ using a neural-network-driven microscopic model. We extend the Control Neural Networks (Ctrl.NN) method and systematically calculate the positive-parity spectrum of $_\Lambda^{12}\mathrm{B}$. By incorporating $sd$-shell excitations and parity-coupling effects into the $_\Lambda^{12}\mathrm{B}$ hypernuclear system, we reveal structural changes, including clustering effects and new configurations such as isosceles-triangle and $\alpha$-$t$-$\alpha$ linear-chain structures. Furthermore, by comparing with experimental data, we identify that many peaks ($\#$6 and $\#$8) can be interpreted as $p_\Lambda$ dominant states, which is consistent with shell-model predictions. Notably, based on our analysis of the excited states of $_\Lambda^{12}\mathrm{B}$, we propose possible candidates for previously unexplained or controversial experimental peaks.</description>

      <title>Kubo formulas for spin polarization in dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics: a first-order gradient expansion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use linear response theory to derive both the non-dissipative and dissipative effects of spin polarization for massive and massless interacting spin 1/2 particles in a relativistic fluid. We list and classify all the possible contributions up to first order in gradients of hydrodynamic fields including the axial chemical potential and the spin potential, and we obtain the corresponding Kubo formulas. We find that all the possible dissipative contributions, except those coming from the gradients of spin potential, require a chiral imbalance or parity violating interactions. In a fluid with chiral imbalance we find a chiral version of the spin Hall effect, i.e. a spin polarization is induced by the gradients of temperature and of axial chemical potential in the direction orthogonal to the momentum of the particle and to the gradients. Moreover, we identify several other new non-dissipative contributions that are not present for free fields.</description>

      <title>Examination of the multiple-scattering expansion in the four-nucleon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic neutron-${}^3\mathrm{H}$ scattering at intermediate energies is studied using rigorous integral equations solved in the momentum-space partial-wave basis. The four-particle transition operators are expanded into multiple-scattering series in terms of subsystem transition operators. Various approximations resulting from truncation of the series in different ways are evaluated and their validity is investigated. They fail at lower energies but at higher energies provide a rough reproduction of exact results at small scattering angles. In the large-angle region all approximations fail heavily, indicating that the scattering amplitude results from a delicate interplay of many multiple-scattering terms. The partial-wave analysis reveals that the developed approximations are reliable in higher partial waves, and for practical calculations an efficient ``hybrid'' approach is proposed, combining exact amplitudes in lower partial waves with approximations in higher partial waves. The implications for often used approximation of the first order in two-body transition matrix and development of microscopic optical potentials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Projective imagining of high-energy nuclei through coherent exclusive vector meson production in electron-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major goals of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is to better understand the distributions of quarks and gluons inside nuclei at high-energy. A principal measurement is coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive $eA$ collisions. The gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution for these VMs. However, the $|t|$ distribution is one of the most challenging measurements at the EIC. This research aims to overcome one of the main obstacles in this measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$, making it difficult to resolve the diffractive pattern from coherent events. We employ a method for reconstructing $|t|$ by utilizing the electron beam polarization in $eA$ collisions and measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution to overcome this complication. Through the study of diffractive VM production, we carry out an experimental simulation of how the detector effect would change the extracted nuclear geometry and how to use projective techniques to avoid defects. This technique will allow us to measure the diffractive pattern in coherent events more precisely, providing a potential solution for a critical measurement that is difficult for the EIC baseline detector.</description>

      <title>Practical parametrization of two-pole structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest that the extended Lee-Friedrichs model could be directly used as a practical parametrization method for the experimental analysis of resonance structures. This parametrization incorporates the constraints of relativistic phase space and the threshold behavior, and respects both unitarity and analyticity constraints of the scattering amplitude. As such, the poles on unphysical Riemann sheets could be easily extracted. This parametrization method offers a comparable fit quality to the improved Breit-Wigner parametrization with an energy-dependent width function when the coupling strength is moderate. It is found that the parametrization could be used to correctly extract the poles near the physical region correctly. In particular, it can naturally incorporate the two-pole structure in which one pole is shifted from the discrete state and the other is dynamically generated. Moreover, the coupled-channel formulation of the extended Lee-Friedrichs parameterization is straightforward and its relationship with the Flatt\'{e} parametrization form is discussed. Using $\rho(770)$, $\Delta(1232)$, $K^*_0$ and $f_0$ states as illustrative examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this parametrization in capturing fit qualities and identifying relevant poles. It is illustrated that the $K_0^*(700)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ could be perfectly parameterized in the Lee-Friedrichs form as a two-pole structure. A tentative investigation of $f_0$s in coupled-channel parametrization form are discussed, and a possible lineshape contributed by $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4012)$ is presented. The proposed parametrization scheme holds promise for future studies involving exotic hadron states near thresholds, offering a valuable tool for analyzing resonance structures in upcoming experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Bounds on variations of the strange quark mass from Big Bang nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of a variation of the strange nucleon matrix element $\langle N| m_s \bar{s}s|N\rangle$ on the abundances of the light elements produced in the Big Bang. For that, we vary the nucleon mass in the leading eight reactions that involve neutrons, protons and the four lightest nuclei. We use various available Big Bang nucleosynthesis codes and find that the measured deuterium and $^4$He abundances set strict limits on the nucleon mass variations. This translates into an upper bound of possible variations of the strange quark mass, $\left| \Delta m_s/m_s \right| \leq 5.1\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these proceedings, I will review lattice QCD calculations of baryon-baryon scattering, their methods, and their challenges. In the last few years, there has been a new generation of calculations with increased focus on controlling systematic uncertainties. Contrary to the findings of earlier exploratory calculations, it now appears probable that at heavy pion masses there is no nucleon-nucleon bound state.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>One-proton emission of $^{102}$Sb and its sensitivity to proton-neutron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-proton emission from the $^{102}$Sb nucleus is discussed, assuming an inert $^{100}$Sn core and the valence proton and neutron. There are experimentally measured bound states in the $^{100}$Sn-neutron system, whereas no particle-bound $^{100}$Sn-proton state has been observed. With time-dependent three-body calculations, the $1^+$ ground state of $^{102}$Sb is suggested as a possible proton emitter. This conclusion is reached by assuming a weakening effect on the proton-neutron ($pn$) interaction with respect to a bare deuteron. An analogous phenomenon is necessary to reproduce the empirical binding energies of $^{42}$Sc and $^{18}$F. Continuous shift from the unbound to bound regions by changing the $pn$-interaction strength is demonstrated. The lower limit of lifetime is evaluated as $\tau \gtrsim 4.4 \times 10^{-18}$ seconds in the no-$pn$-interaction limit. However, the actual lifetime is expected as longer with a finite $pn$ interaction. Observation of a resonant state in $^{102}$Sb and its decay would provide a benchmark of the $pn$-pairing correlation.</description>

      <title>Puzzling $B(E2;0^+\rightarrow 2^+)$ strength in the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the $E2$ transition rate from the ground state to the first 2$^+$ excited state of the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca show an unusual pattern when compared to its isotopic neighbor $^{38}$Ca: despite having a higher $E_x(2_1^+)$ excitation energy, the $B(E2; 0^+_1\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ rate in $^{36}$Ca is larger. The question that naturally arises is to what extent this observation can be attributed to the unbound character of the $2^+_1$ state. To understand the influence of the continuum space on the low-energy properties of $^{36}$Ca, we carried out Gamow shell model calculations that can account for the continuum coupling effects. We found that in the threshold $2^+$ state, $^{36}$Ca is spatially diffused, which accounts for the abnormal $B(E2)$ trend observed.</description>

      <title>Qutrit and Qubit Circuits for Three-Flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Implementation and investigation of electron-nucleus scattering in the \textsc{NEUT} neutrino event generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear effects is essential for improving the sensitivity of neutrino oscillation measurements. Validating nuclear models solely through neutrino scattering data is challenging due to limited statistics and the broad energy spectrum of neutrinos. In contrast, electron scattering experiments provide abundant high-precision data with various monochromatic energies and angles. Since both neutrinos and electrons interact via electroweak interactions, the same nuclear models can be applied to simulate both interactions. Thus, high-precision electron scattering data is essential for validating the nuclear models used in neutrino experiments. To enable this, the author has introduced a new electron scattering framework in the \textsc{NEUT} neutrino event generator, covering two interaction modes: quasielastic (QE) and single pion production. \textsc{NEUT} predictions of QE agree well with numerical calculations, supporting the validity of this implementation. From comparisons with \textsc{NEUT} predictions and inclusive electron scattering data, the momentum-dependent removal energy correction is derived, addressing effects beyond the plane wave impulse approximation. This correction is applied to neutrino interactions, observing significant changes in charged lepton kinematics. Notably, the reconstructed neutrino energy distribution shows a peak shift of approximately 20--30\,MeV, which is crucial for accurately measuring neutrino oscillation parameters.</description>
