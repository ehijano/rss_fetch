      <title>Opportunistic Delay Tolerant Routing for LED Wristbands in Music Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing technology used for LED wristbands does not explore the use of opportunistic delay tolerant network (DTN) routing protocols to disseminate lighting information. This paper multiple trade-offs of different criteria with the protocol (Spray &amp; Focus and PRoPHETv2) changes with varying music event scenario configurations &amp; capacities using the ONE simulator. When considering variable music event durations, it was shown that PRoPHETv2 was more desirable for longer durations however Spray &amp; Focus accounted for network congestion issues that could occur for smaller buffer sizes in the wristbands. When considering variable patterns of audience density, Spray &amp; Focus had higher delivery probabilities whereas PRoPHETv2 had near zero results. Further research can be conducted in incorporating buffer removal management to the protocols as well as experimenting with different congestion targeted DTN protocols.</description>

      <title>TD-MQTT: Transparent Distributed MQTT Brokers for Horizontal IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) has become the perfect messaging protocol for IoT (Internet of Things) systems since it is the lightest protocol designed for low bandwidth, high-latency, unreliable networks. Today, the strategy of distributing several MQTT brokers on the networks is widely used because the strategy of using a single broker is no longer efficient. However, in the distributing architectures of MQTT brokers, a subscriber should have prior knowledge about the address of the broker that publishes the data on the topics of interest. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a mechanism that connects the subscribers to the brokers in a transparent way. The proposed approach, known as TD-MQTT (Transparent Distributed MQTT brokers), requires no prior knowledge of the brokers by the subscribers. The data will be carried automatically from brokers that can change their configuration and location. The transparency will help to use IoT data without worrying about their location and dynamic configuration changes. To evaluate our approach, we compared it with the basic distributed MQTT and the EMMA (MQTT Middle-ware for Edge Computing Applications) approach. The results of the evaluation show that TD-MQTT is much better than the standard MQTT, especially in terms of response time.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of State Space Models for Network Traffic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many problems in computer networking rely on parsing collections of network traces (e.g., traffic prioritization, intrusion detection). Unfortunately, the availability and utility of these collections is limited due to privacy concerns, data staleness, and low representativeness. While methods for generating data to augment collections exist, they often fall short in replicating the quality of real-world traffic In this paper, we i) survey the evolution of traffic simulators/generators and ii) propose the use of state-space models, specifically Mamba, for packet-level, synthetic network trace generation by modeling it as an unsupervised sequence generation problem. Early evaluation shows that state-space models can generate synthetic network traffic with higher statistical similarity to real traffic than the state-of-the-art. Our approach thus has the potential to reliably generate realistic, informative synthetic network traces for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>To Sense or Not To Sense: A Delay Perspective (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ever-growing demand for low-latency services in machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, the delay performance of random access networks has become a primary concern, which critically depends on the sensing capability of nodes. To understand the effect of sensing on the optimal delay performance, the challenge lies in unifying the delay analysis of sensing-free Aloha and sensing-based Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) with various design features such as backoff and connection-free or connection-based. In this paper, based on a unified analytical framework, the mean queueing delay of data packets with Aloha and CSMA is characterized and optimized, with which the upper-bound of sensing time for CSMA to outperform Aloha in terms of the minimum mean queueing delay is further obtained. The analysis is also applied to the Random Access-Based Small Data Transmission (RA-SDT) schemes in 5G networks to investigate when and how significant their delay performance can be improved by sensing, which sheds important insights into practical access protocol design.</description>

      <title>Hurry: Dynamic Collaborative Framework For Low-orbit Mega-Constellation Data Downloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-orbit mega-constellation network, which utilize thousands of satellites to provide a variety of network services and collect a wide range of space information, is a rapidly growing field. Each satellite collects TB-level data daily, including delay-sensitive data used for crucial tasks, such as military surveillance, natural disaster monitoring, and weather forecasting. According to NASA's statement, these data need to be downloaded to the ground for processing within 3 to 5 hours. To reduce the time required for satellite data downloads, the state-of-the-art solution known as CoDld, which is only available for small constellations, uses an iterative method for cooperative downloads via inter-satellite links. However, in LMCN, the time required to download the same amount of data using CoDld will exponentially increase compared to downloading the same amount of data in a small constellation. We have identified and analyzed the reasons for this degradation phenomenon and propose a new satellite data download framework, named Hurry. By modeling and mapping satellite topology changes and data transmission to Time-Expanded Graphs, we implement our algorithm within the Hurry framework to avoid degradation effects. In the fixed data volume download evaluation, Hurry achieves 100% completion of the download task while the CoDld only reached 44% of download progress. In continuous data generation evaluation, the Hurry flow algorithm improves throughput from 11% to 66% compared to the CoDld in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Redefining DDoS Attack Detection Using A Dual-Space Prototypical Network-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose an increasingly substantial cybersecurity threat to organizations across the globe. In this paper, we introduce a new deep learning-based technique for detecting DDoS attacks, a paramount cybersecurity challenge with evolving complexity and scale. Specifically, we propose a new dual-space prototypical network that leverages a unique dual-space loss function to enhance detection accuracy for various attack patterns through geometric and angular similarity measures. This approach capitalizes on the strengths of representation learning within the latent space (a lower-dimensional representation of data that captures complex patterns for machine learning analysis), improving the model's adaptability and sensitivity towards varying DDoS attack vectors. Our comprehensive evaluation spans multiple training environments, including offline training, simulated online training, and prototypical network scenarios, to validate the model's robustness under diverse data abundance and scarcity conditions. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Attention, trained with our dual-space prototypical design over a reduced training set, achieves an average accuracy of 94.85% and an F1-Score of 94.71% across our tests, showcasing its effectiveness in dynamic and constrained real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>RoutePlacer: An End-to-End Routability-Aware Placer with Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Placement is a critical and challenging step of modern chip design, with routability being an essential indicator of placement quality. Current routability-oriented placers typically apply an iterative two-stage approach, wherein the first stage generates a placement solution, and the second stage provides non-differentiable routing results to heuristically improve the solution quality. This method hinders jointly optimizing the routability aspect during placement. To address this problem, this work introduces RoutePlacer, an end-to-end routability-aware placement method. It trains RouteGNN, a customized graph neural network, to efficiently and accurately predict routability by capturing and fusing geometric and topological representations of placements. Well-trained RouteGNN then serves as a differentiable approximation of routability, enabling end-to-end gradient-based routability optimization. In addition, RouteGNN can improve two-stage placers as a plug-and-play alternative to external routers. Our experiments on DREAMPlace, an open-source AI4EDA platform, show that RoutePlacer can reduce Total Overflow by up to 16% while maintaining routed wirelength, compared to the state-of-the-art; integrating RouteGNN within two-stage placers leads to a 44% reduction in Total Overflow without compromising wirelength.</description>

      <title>Lightweight CNN-BiLSTM based Intrusion Detection Systems for Resource-Constrained IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have played a significant role in detecting and preventing cyber-attacks within traditional computing systems. It is not surprising that the same technology is being applied to secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks from cyber threats. The limited computational resources available on IoT devices make it challenging to deploy conventional computing-based IDSs. The IDSs designed for IoT environments must also demonstrate high classification performance, utilize low-complexity models, and be of a small size. Despite significant progress in IoT-based intrusion detection, developing models that both achieve high classification performance and maintain reduced complexity remains challenging. In this study, we propose a hybrid CNN architecture composed of a lightweight CNN and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to enhance the performance of IDS on the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The proposed model is specifically designed to run onboard resource-constrained IoT devices and meet their computation capability requirements. Despite the complexity of designing a model that fits the requirements of IoT devices and achieves higher accuracy, our proposed model outperforms the existing research efforts in the literature by achieving an accuracy of 97.28\% for binary classification and 96.91\% for multiclassification.</description>

      <title>Age-Threshold Slotted ALOHA for Optimizing Information Freshness in Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We optimize the Age of Information (AoI) in mobile networks using the age-threshold slotted ALOHA (TSA) protocol. The network comprises multiple source-destination pairs, where each source sends a sequence of status update packets to its destination over a shared spectrum. The TSA protocol stipulates that a source node must remain silent until its AoI reaches a predefined threshold, after which the node accesses the radio channel with a certain probability. Using stochastic geometry tools, we derive analytical expressions for the transmission success probability, mean peak AoI, and time-average AoI. Subsequently, we obtain closed-form expressions for the optimal update rate and age threshold that minimize the mean peak and time-average AoI, respectively. In addition, we establish a scaling law for the mean peak AoI and time-average AoI in mobile networks, revealing that the optimal mean peak AoI and time-average AoI increase linearly with the deployment density. Notably, the growth rate of time-average AoI under TSA is half of that under conventional slotted ALOHA. When considering the optimal mean peak AoI, the TSA protocol exhibits comparable performance to the traditional slotted ALOHA protocol. These findings conclusively affirm the advantage of TSA in reducing higher-order AoI, particularly in densely deployed networks.</description>

      <title>Hercules: Heterogeneous Requirements Congestion Control Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future network services present a significant challenge for network providers due to high number and high variety of co-existing requirements. Despite many advancements in network architectures and management schemes, congested network links continue to constrain the Quality of Service (QoS) for critical applications like tele-surgery and autonomous driving. A prominent, complimentary approach consists of congestion control (CC) protocols which regulate bandwidth at the endpoints before network congestion occurs. However, existing CC protocols, including recent ones, are primarily designed to handle small numbers of requirement classes, highlighting the need for a more granular and flexible congestion control solution.
  In this paper we introduce Hercules, a novel CC protocol designed to handle heterogeneous requirements. Hercules is based on an online learning approach and has the capability to support any combination of requirements within an unbounded and continuous requirements space. We have implemented Hercules as a QUIC module and demonstrate, through extensive analysis and real-world experiments, that Hercules can achieve up to 3.5-fold improvement in QoS compared to state-of-the-art CC protocols.</description>
