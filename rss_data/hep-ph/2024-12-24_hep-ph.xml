      <title>A New Bite Into Dark Matter with the SNSPD-Based QROCODILE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results from the Quantum Resolution-Optimized Cryogenic Observatory for Dark matter Incident at Low Energy (QROCODILE). The QROCODILE experiment uses a microwire-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) as a target and sensor for dark matter scattering and absorption, and is sensitive to energy deposits as low as 0.11 eV. We introduce the experimental configuration and report new world-leading constraints on the interactions of sub-MeV dark matter particles with masses as low as 30 keV. The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity. In addition, we leverage the coupling between phonons and quasiparticles in the detector to simultaneously constrain interactions with both electrons and nucleons. We discuss the potential for improvements to both the energy threshold and effective volume of the experiment in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: $\eta$ and $\eta'$ poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudoscalar-pole contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering are determined by the respective transition form factors (TFFs) into two virtual photons. These TFFs constitute complicated functions of the photon virtualities that, in turn, can be reconstructed in a dispersive approach from their discontinuities. In this work, we present such an analysis for the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ TFFs, implementing a number of constraints from both experiment and theory: normalizations from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay widths, unitarity constraints from the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ spectra, chiral symmetry for the $\eta^{(\prime)}\to2(\pi^+\pi^-)$ amplitudes, vector-meson couplings, singly-virtual data from $e^+e^-\to e^+e^-\eta^{(\prime)}$, and the asymptotic behavior predicted by the light-cone expansion. In particular, we account for the leading left-hand-cut singularity by including effects from the $a_2$ resonance, necessitating the solution of an inhomogeneous Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es problem via a carefully chosen path deformation. The resulting TFFs allow us to evaluate the $\eta^{(\prime)}$-pole contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-pole}}=14.7(9)\times 10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta'\text{-pole}}=13.5(7)\times 10^{-11}$, completing a dedicated program for the lowest-lying pseudoscalar intermediate states in a dispersive approach to hadronic light-by-light scattering, $a_\mu^{\text{PS-poles}}=91.2^{+2.9}_{-2.4}\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Dark Sectors in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phase transition in the dark sector (DS) presents a promising explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signals detected in recent observations by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Instead of focusing solely on fitting data with phenomenological parameters, we systematically delineate simple, underlying dark sector (DS) models at the microscopic, Lagrangian level and uncover the conditions required to yield the GW spectrum observed by PTAs. We also illustrate the possibilities of the DS cosmology, which may include a dark matter candidate with a $\mathcal{O}$(MeV) mass.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Electron Detectors for Dark Matter-Nucleon Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal paper now a decade old, it was shown that dark matter detectors geared at probing interactions with nucleons could also be used to probe dark matter interactions with electrons. In this work, we show that new detector concepts designed to probe dark matter-electron interactions at low masses can similarly be used to probe new parameter space for dark matter-nucleon interactions. We demonstrate the power of this approach by using existing data from superconducting detectors to place new limits on the interactions of nuclei with MeV-scale dark matter. Further, we show that advances in detector technology that have been anticipated for electronic interactions will automatically extend sensitivity deep into uncharted territory for nuclear interactions. This doubles the effective science output of future low-threshold experiments.</description>

      <title>Most general EFTs from spurion analysis: Hilbert series and Minimal Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a saturation theorem for general Effective Field Theories (EFTs) constructed using spurion analysis. Let $S$ be a set of spurion fields introduced to organize the breaking of a global symmetry $G_f$, and $H_S$ be the subgroup of $G_f$ that remains unbroken under a generic vacuum expectation value $\langle S\rangle$; we show that the EFT Lagrangian constructed from the spurion analysis $saturates$ the EFT Lagrangian without the spurions but restricted to $H_S$ invariance, provided that arbitrary powers of the spurion fields are allowed. As examples, we study several implementations of the Minimal Lepton Flavor Violation (MLFV) principle, corresponding to various origins of the neutrino masses. In each scenario, we compute the Hilbert series to obtain the numbers of independent lepton flavor covariants that appear in the corresponding EFT at mass dimension 6. These numbers agree with the number of $H_S$ invariants in the EFT without the spurions, demonstrating the saturation theorem. Motivated by phenomenological connections, we provide linearly independent spurion polynomials for selected lepton flavor covariants. An ancillary file is supplied at https://github.com/HilbertSeries/Group_Invariants_and_Covariants , which is a Mathematica notebook that provides functions for computing general Hilbert series of invariants and covariants of compact classical groups. It presents examples demonstrating the use of the code, including the Hilbert series for our MLFV scenarios.</description>

      <title>Anomalous electroweak physics unraveled via evidential deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth in beyond standard model (BSM) models and parametrizations has placed strong emphasis on systematically intercomparing within the range of possible models with controlled uncertainties. In this setting, the language of uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides quantitative metrics of assessing overlaps and discrepancies between models. We leverage recent machine learning (ML) developments in evidential deep learning (EDL) for UQ to separate data (aleatoric) and knowledge (epistemic) uncertainties in a model discrimination setting. In this study, we construct several potentially BSM-motivated scenarios for the anomalous electroweak interaction (AEWI) of neutrinos with nucleons in deep inelastic scattering ($\nu$DIS). These scenarios are then quantitatively mapped, as a demonstration, alongside Monte Carlo replicas of the CT18 PDFs used to calculate the $\Delta \chi^{2}$ statistic for a typical multi-GeV $\nu$DIS experiment, CDHSW. Our framework effectively highlights areas of model agreement and provides a classification of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. By offering the opportunity to identify unexplored regions of parameter space while understanding domains of model overlap, the approach presented in this work can help facilitate efficient BSM model exploration and exclusion for future New Physics searches.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Neutrino-Nucleus Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino-nucleus scattering cross sections are critical theoretical inputs for long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. However, robust modeling of these cross sections remains challenging. For a simple but physically motivated toy model of the DUNE experiment, we demonstrate that an accurate neural-network model of the cross section -- leveraging Standard Model symmetries -- can be learned from near-detector data. We then perform a neutrino oscillation analysis with simulated far-detector events, finding that the modeled cross section achieves results consistent with what could be obtained if the true cross section were known exactly. This proof-of-principle study highlights the potential of future neutrino near-detector datasets and data-driven cross-section models.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of pomeron intercept via scaling entropy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we confront the geometrical scaling properties of inclusive DIS cross section ($e+p\rightarrow e +X$) with the scaling entropy obtained from event multiplicity. We show that these two quantities are equivalent in the kinematic range probed by H1 Collaboration data. We propose that scaling entropy associated with partonic interactions is a more efficient way to detect scaling in experimental data. We used a combined analysis of the inclusive cross section and entropy obtained from multiplicities $P(N)$ of final-state hadrons to accurately determine the value of the Pomeron intercept. The approach could provide new constraints for future hadron collider experiments and deepen our understanding of parton saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research in neutrino physics has been very active, both in experimental advances, with a new generation of detectors in operation and planning, and in theoretical discussions regarding the fundamental nature of the neutrino. This scientific dynamism has attracted many new students to the field. One of the first topics studied in neutrino physics by newcomers is the formalism of neutrino flavor oscillations and its associated phenomenology. We present this work as a compilation of this basic knowledge, through a step-by-step approach that facilitates an efficient understanding of this vast theoretical and experimental landscape.</description>

      <title>NNLO phase-space integrals for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the phase-space integrals that arise in double real emission diagrams for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. Utilizing the reverse unitarity technique, we convert these integrals into loop integrals, allowing us to employ integration-by-parts identities and reduce them to a set of master integrals. The master integrals are then solved using the method of differential equations and expressed in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. By examining the series expansion in the dimensional regulator, we discover additional relations among some of the master integrals. As an alternative approach, we solve the master integrals by decomposing them into angular and radial components. The angular parts are evaluated using Mellin-Barnes representation, while special attention is given to the singular structures of the radial integrals to handle them accurately. Here the results are provided in terms of one-fold integrals over classical polylogarithms. This approach provides a clearer understanding of the origin of soft and collinear singularities.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Constraints on Covariant Density Functional Equations of State of Compact Stars with New NICER Mass-Radius Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in astrophysical observations of compact stars, particularly the new and updated NICER constraints, have provided mass-radius ($M$-$R$) data for pulsars spanning masses from 1 to $2\,M_{\odot}$. These data offer a unique opportunity to test modern theories of dense matter using multi-messenger constraints. Covariant density functional (CDF) models of nuclear matter, which capture a broad range of nuclear and astrophysical phenomena, provide a robust theoretical framework to interpret these observations. This study applies the Bayesian framework to a class of CDF models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings, specifically those based on nucleonic degrees of freedom. By incorporating the latest multi-messenger constraints, we impose tighter limits on the parameter space of these models and assess their consistency with observational data. Our analysis advances previous efforts by refining the density-dependence parameterization and integrating recent $M$-$R$ ellipses. This enables more stringent evaluations of dense matter models in light of new astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Dark photons and tachyonic instability induced by Barbero-Immirzi parameter and axion-torsion transmutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Holst gravity by examining two distinct examples. The first example involves minimal coupling to torsion, while the second explores non-minimal coupling. The motivation for the first example stems from the recent work by Dombriz, which utilized a technique of imposing constraint constant coefficients to massive torsion in the model Lagrangian to determine parameters for the Einstein-Cartan-Holst gravity. We extend this methodology to investigate dark photons, where axial torsion transforms into axions.Interest in elucidating the abundance of dark photons within the framework of general relativity was sparked by Agrawal. Building on the work of Barman, who explored minimal coupling of massive torsion mediated by dark matter (DM) with light torsion on the order of 1.7 TeV, we have derived a Barbero-Immirzi (BI) parameter of approximately 0.775. This value falls within the range established by Panza et al. at TeV scales, specifically $0\le{\beta}\le{1.185}$. This seems to our knowledge the first time BI parameter is induced by dark photons on a minimal EC gravity. Very recently, implications of findings of BI parameter in cosmological bounces has appeared in the literature. For a smaller BI parameter a higher torsion mass of 1.51 TeV is obtained. Nevertheless. this figure is still a signature of light torsion which can be compatible with light dark photon masses. Magnetic helicity instability of dark photons is investigated. Axion oscillation frequency is shown to depend on the BI parameter and the BI spectra is determined by an histogram. This study not only broadens the understanding of Holst gravity but also provides crucial insights into the interplay between torsion, dark photons, and axions in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>PDFxTMDLib: a parton distribution library for both transverse and collinear parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present PDFxTMD, a novel library for parton distribution functions (PDFs) which integrates both collinear PDFs (cPDFs) and transverse momentum-dependent PDFs (TMDs). Designed with modern C++ principles, including the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) and type erasure, PDFxTMD achieves high performance while ensuring extensibility. The library offers well-defined interfaces for reading PDF grid files, as well as for interpolation and extrapolation, enabling users to implement tailored solutions for their specific needs. PDFxTMD supports standard file formats from LHAPDF and TMDLib, while also allowing for adaptability to non-standard formats through its extensible architecture. By providing a unified and efficient framework for PDF computations, PDFxTMD aims to enhance the toolkit available to the high-energy physics community for cross-section calculations in both collinear and $k_t$-factorization frameworks.</description>

Abstract: We provide an update on QCD predictions for top-quark pair production close to threshold including bound state effects at the Large Hadron Collider. We compute the top-quark pair invariant mass distribution $d\sigma/dM_{t\bar{t}}$, including Coulomb resummation for bound-state effects, as well as threshold resummation for emissions of soft and collinear gluons. We discuss uncertainty estimates and present a proposal for the use of these predictions in experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>$2^{++}$ Di-gluonium from LSR at higher order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the determination of the mass and coupling of the $2^{++}$ tensor di-gluonium by using relativistic QCD Laplace sum rules (LSR). In so doing, we evaluate the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the perturbative (PT) and $\langle \alpha_s G^2 \rangle$ condensate and the lowest order (LO) $\langle G^3 \rangle$ contributions to the $2^{++}$ di-gluonium two-point correlator. Within a vacuum saturation estimate ($k_G=1$) of the dimension-eight gluon condensates, we obtain: $M_{T}=3028(287)\mbox{MeV}$ and the renormalization group invariant (RGI) coupling $\hat{f}_T=224(33)\mbox{MeV}$. Assuming that the factorization hypothesis can be violated, we study the effect of the violation factor $k_G$ on the results and obtain: $M_T=3188(337)\mbox{MeV}$ and $\hat{f}_T=245(32)\mbox{MeV}$ for $k_G=(3\pm 2)$. Our estimation does not favour the interpretation of the observed $f_2(2010)$, $f_2(2300)$ and $f_2(2340)$ as pure glueball state.</description>

      <title>Influence of a nontrivial Polyakov loop on the quarkonium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a hybrid approach based on a phenomenological heavy-quark potential model and the background field effective theory, we assess the influence of a nontrivial Polyakov loop on the in-medium properties of the heavy quarkonium states. Without resorting to any temperature-dependent parameter, the lattice simulations on the complex heavy-quark potential are well reproduced with the potential model in which the screening masses are determined by the background field effective theory. Due to the reduced screening strength near the deconfining temperature, a nontrivial Polyakov loop leads to a dramatic increase in the binding energies, together with a moderate decrease in the decay widths. In general, a more tightly bounded quarkonium state can be expected, although the increase in the dissociation temperatures is significant only for relatively large-size bounded states. Our results indicate that the background field modification on the binding and decay of the quarkonium states may have a notable impact on the density evolution of quarkonia during the expansion of the fireball, and thus on the final observed quarkonium spectra.</description>

      <title>Elastic Neutrino-electron Scattering at the One-loop Level in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform an independent and complete calculation of the differential cross section for elastic neutrino-electron scattering at the one-loop level in the Standard Model (SM), by using up-to-date values of relevant input parameters in the on-shell renormalization scheme. A careful comparison with the calculation done by Sarantakos, Sirlin and Marciano more than forty years ago in the same scheme is carried out, and an excellent agreement is found if the same values of input parameters are taken. Then we apply our results to compute the event rates for the detection of reactor antineutrinos in both JUNO and TAO experiments, which are now under construction and will soon be in operation. Our results are also applicable to incident neutrinos and antineutrinos in a broad range of energies, such as supernova neutrinos and accelerator neutrinos. It should be emphasized that one-loop radiative corrections in the SM must be taken into account in the first place when searching for possible new-physics effects in the coming era of precision neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Prospecting bipartite Dark Matter through Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational wave probes of a two-component dark matter framework, consisting of an $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar and a Standard Model singlet fermion. The triplet scalar dark matter typically remains underabundant in the region below $\sim 1.9$ TeV, due to the strong $SU(2)_L$ gauge mediated interactions. We introduce a second dark matter component, an $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like Dirac fermion, to address this deficit in the dark matter relic abundance within a sub-TeV range. A key aspect of the proposed setup is the potential dark matter inter-conversion between the two components, which impacts the dark matter freeze-out dynamics and relic density of individual dark matter components. In such a scenario, we examine the properties of electroweak phase transition and identify the regions of parameter space that exhibit strong first-order phase transition. We estimate the resulting gravitational wave spectrum and its detectability, which could be probed through the conventional power-law-integrated sensitivity limits and the recently proposed peak-integrated sensitivity curves. Our analysis reveals that a novel region of the model's parameter space, compatible with dark matter observables, can generate a detectable gravitational wave spectrum, observable by upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, and DECIGOcorr, while also offering complementary detection prospects in the dark matter and collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards UV-Models of Kinetic Mixing and Portal Matter VII: A Light Dark Photon in the $3_c3_L1_A1_B$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic mixing (KM) portal, by which the Standard Model (SM) photon mixes with a light dark photon arising from a new $U(1)_D$ gauge group, allows for the possibility of viable scenarios of sub-GeV thermal dark matter (DM) with appropriately suppressed couplings to the SM. This KM can only occur if particles having both SM and dark quantum numbers, here termed portal matter (PM), also exist. The presence of such types of states and the strong suggestion of a need to embed $U(1)_D$ into a non-abelian gauge structure not too far above the TeV scale based on the RGE running of the $U(1)_D$ gauge coupling is potentially indicative of an enlarged group linking together the visible and dark sectors. The gauge group $G=SU(3)_c\times SU(3)_L\times U(1)_A\times U(1)_B=3_c3_L1_A1_B$ is perhaps the simplest setup wherein the SM and dark interactions are partially unified in a non-abelian fashion that is not a simple product group of the form $G=G_{SM}\times G_D$ encountered frequently in earlier work. The present paper describes the implications and phenomenology of this type of setup.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark mass relation from a standard-model boson operator representation in terms of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract The standard-model can be equivalently represented with its fields in a spin-extended basis, departing from fermion degrees of freedom. The common Higgs operator connects the electroweak and Yukawa sectors, restricting the top and bottom quark masses[Phys. Rev. D 99, 073001, 2019]. Using second quantization, within the heavy-particle sector, electroweak vectors, the Higgs field, and symmetry operators are expanded in terms of bilinear combinations of top and bottom quark operators, considering discrete degrees of freedom and chirality. This is interpreted as either a basis choice or as a description of composite models. The vacuum expectation value is calculated quantum mechanically, which relates to the common mass-generating scalar operator and it reproduces the vector and quark-doublet masses. This also links the corresponding scalar-vector and Yukawa vertices, and restricts the t- and b-quark masses in a hierarchy relation.</description>

      <title>Pomeron Weights in QCD Processes at High Energy and the $S$-Matrix Unitarity Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pomeron topological cross-section is derived for the eikonal and the $U$-matrix unitarization schemes using a generalized expansion of the unitarized elastic amplitude in an effort to examine pomeron characteristics, namely the multiplicity distribution, fluctuation, and correlation, and to reveal the impact of pomeron weights on the $pp$ multiplicity distribution. The results demonstrate that the U-matrix inherently incorporates a larger amount of diffraction production into the multi-pomeron vertices, yielding a larger pomerons' variability regardless of the energy range, while such fluctuations become significant only beyond a specific high-energy threshold in the eikonal and quasi-eikonal schemes. Most importantly, our findings indicate that within the $U$-matrix scheme, an increase in exchanged pomerons results in more pronounced higher-order pomeron correlations, which are affected by the energy and the impact parameter. Interestingly, our outcomes also highlight that the correlated pomeron exchanges within the U-matrix summation play a key role in enhancing multi-parton collisions. In light of these results, we can argue that the U-matrix is fundamentally more valid for theories with growing cross-sections with energy, such as QCD at high energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, which introduces the "Crossing the Portal" session of the NOW 2024 meeting, I discuss the value of the concepts of interdisciplinarity and innovation for neutrino physics. After some historical considerations, which provide an initial illustration of the significant role of these concepts, I review some well-known cases of neutrino science, involving both astrophysics and particle physics, which allow us to deepen the analysis. The importance of a harmonious relationship between theoretical elaborations and experiments emerges: effective collaboration between theoretical and experimental physicists played a key role in many of the successful cases and proved marginal or defective in the doubtful ones. The discussion highlights also the need to proceed armed with a patience, a virtue that Feynman himself indicated as essential to science, all the more necessary when investigating interesting but elusive particles such as neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a first-order phase transition of the inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the production of gravitational waves (GW) resulting from a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in a non-minimally coupled `Dark Higgs Inflation' model. Utilizing a dark sector scalar field as the inflaton, we demonstrate how inflationary dynamics naturally set the stage for observable FOPT. These transitions, influenced by thermal and quantum effects, generate GW spectra potentially detectable by observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our study highlights the inflaton's dual role in cosmic inflation and early Universe phase transitions, presenting a unified framework to probe physics beyond the Standard Model through gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new scenario of freeze-in, where the dark matter is produced exclusively via the annihilation of photons. We study fermionic and scalar dark matter models with a focus on cosmological histories with low reheat temperatures. Photonic freeze-in can be probed via direct detection, dark matter production in SN1987A, and via the production of new electromagnetically charged states at the Large Hadron Collider. We briefly discuss UV-complete models that can realise this scenario.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deuteron gravitational form factors (GFFs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) within the soft-wall AdS/QCD model, where deuteron is described by the bulk vector field with twist $\tau=6$. For the finite-temperature studies, we apply the soft-wall model, which is thermalized by introducing a thermal dilaton field. GPDs and charge density are considered in impact parameter (IP) space and at zero and finite temperatures. We plot the temperature dependence of these quantities in IP space and observe a decreasing of their peaks on temperature increasing. The gravitational root means squared radius obtained here is close to the range given by experimental data for the mass radius and has low sensitivity to the temperature.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Three-Loop Vacuum-Polarization Correction in Muonic Bound Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-loop electronic vacuum-polarization corrections due to irreducible diagrams are evaluated for two-body muonic ions with nuclear charge numbers 1 &lt;= Z &lt;= 6. The corrections are of order alpha^3 (Zalpha)^2 m_r, where alpha is the fine-structure constant and m_r is the reduced mass. Numerically, the energy corrections are found to be of the same order-of-magnitude as the largest of the order alpha^2 (Zalpha)^6 m_r corrections, and are thus phenomenologically interesting. Our method of calculation eliminates numerical uncertainty encountered in other approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an event-by-event study of photons produced by the chiral magnetic effect in the early stage of high-energy nuclear collisions. We model the early stage with an evolving, 2+1 dimensional, glasma, initialized via the McLerran-Venugopalan model. The photons are produced from the interplay of the chiral anomaly of quantum chromodynamics and the strong magnetic fields generated by the colliding nuclei. In particular, we focus on the spectrum and the elliptic flow of the produced photons. We find that the chiral magnetic effect has a minor impact on the photon spectrum compared to other production mechanisms as well as to experimental data. However, the photons produced by the present early stage mechanism can exhibit a significant elliptic flow.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as background and signal in Migdal search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionization or excitation resulting from the delayed response of the electron cloud to nuclear recoil is known as the Migdal effect. Dark matter searches utilizing this process set the most stringent bounds on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section over a large region of the sub-GeV dark matter parameter space, underscoring its significance in dark matter detection. In this paper, we quantify the regions of dark matter parameter space that are challenging to probe via the Migdal effect due to the presence of dominant solar neutrino backgrounds for both liquid noble and semiconductor targets. Our findings reveal that there is no hard floor in the dark matter parameter space. Instead, we map the so called neutrino fog. In mapping the neutrino fog, we identify the importance of incorporating the Migdal effect induced by neutrinos, as well as neutrino-electron scattering and dominant coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, particularly for semiconductor targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a large portion of the relic density allowed parameter space lies within the neutrino fog. Finally, we estimate the exposure required to detect neutrino induced Migdal events in direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>hep-aid: A Python Library for Sample Efficient Parameter Scans in Beyond the Standard Model Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents hep-aid, a modular Python library conceived for utilising, implementing, and developing parameter scan algorithms. Originally devised for sample-efficient, multi-objective active search approaches in computationally expensive Beyond Standard Model (BSM) phenomenology, the library currently integrates three Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches: a Constraint Active Search (CAS) algorithm, a multi-objective Active Search (AS) method (called b-CASTOR), and a self-exploration method named Machine Learning Scan (MLScan). These approaches address the challenge of multi-objective optimisation in high-dimensional BSM scenarios by employing surrogate models and strategically exploring parameter spaces to identify regions that satisfy complex objectives with fewer evaluations. Additionally, a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (MCMC-MH) is implemented for method comparison. The library also includes a High Energy Physics (HEP) module based on SPheno as the spectrum calculator. However, the library modules and functionalities are designed to be easily extended and used also with other external software for phenomenology. This manual provides an introduction on how to use the main functionalities of hep-aid and describes the design and structure of the library. Demonstrations based on the aforementioned parameter scan methods show that hep-aid methodologies enhance the efficiency of BSM studies, offering a versatile toolset for complex, multi-objective searches for new physics in HEP contexts exploiting advanced ML-based approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Lorentz invariant and little group covariant description of beta decay amplitudes relying on on-shell amplitude methods and the spinor variables for massive particles. The framework is employed to calculate Coulomb corrections to the decay amplitude and their contribution to T -odd correlation coefficients, including the D parameter. In the SM limit we recover the known results for the Coulomb contributions to D and update their numerical values. We also calculate new subleading contributions to D in the presence of non-standard scalar and tensor interactions. We also point out that two other T -odd correlation coefficients are generated in the SM at the same order as the D parameter, and provide their numerical values for selected transitions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Inert Scalar Dark Matter with Vector-like Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inert doublet model (IDM), a minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM), provides a scalar dark matter (DM) candidate that belongs to the additional Higgs doublet. The model faces challenges in achieving the correct relic abundance for compressed spectra and DM masses in the high-mass range. In this work we introduce a $Z_2$-odd singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) into the IDM framework that helps us alleviate these issues and provide new channels of contributions to the relic abundance. The VLQ not only enhances the DM relic abundance for masses above $~550$ GeV but also eases constraints from direct detection experiments by enabling smaller couplings between the inert scalars and the SM Higgs. We analyze the impact of the VLQ on DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection constraints. The results demonstrate that the extended IDM framework not only resolves existing limitations in the compressed spectrum but also offers exciting prospects for detection in current and future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking with a massless dark photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dark gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (dark GMSB) in a theory with a new unbroken $U(1)_{D}$ local symmetry and massless dark photon. Messenger fields charged under both Standard Model and dark gauge symmetries produce new soft supersymmetry-breaking terms due to gauge kinetic mixing between $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge and $U(1)_D$. We show that large kinetic mixing induces significant distortions to the superpartner spectra relative to conventional GMSB. Notably, shifts in the Higgs soft masses impact the conditions for electroweak symmetry breaking, lowering the $\mu$ parameter and yielding a relatively light Higgsino that may be accessible at the LHC. Furthermore, for very simple messenger representations, a very light bino-dark photino mixed state is present in the spectrum, which may be probed through exotic Higgs boson decays at future Higgs factories. We also examine the cosmological and phenomenological consequences of the messengers, the lightest of which is absolutely stable and carries fractional electric charge.</description>

      <title>Encoding off-shell effects in top pair production in Direct Diffusion networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the precision targets of upcoming LHC runs in the simulation of top pair production events it is essential to also consider off-shell effects. Due to their great computational cost I propose to encode them in neural networks. For that I use a combination of neural networks that take events with approximate off-shell effects and transform them into events that match those obtained with full off-shell calculations. This was shown to work reliably and efficiently at leading order. Here I discuss first steps extending this method to include higher order effects.</description>

      <title>Feebly-Interacting Peccei-Quinn Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD axion is widely studied as a dark matter (DM) candidate and as a solution to the strong CP problem of the Standard Model. In conventional field-theoretic models, a much larger mass scale than the electroweak (EW) scale is typically introduced to spontaneously break Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry with a large enough axion decay constant, $f_a$, thereby avoiding constraints from star cooling. In this paper, I propose an alternative approach to achieving the large decay constant: a PQ scalar field with a large wave function renormalization constant, analogous to a feebly coupled gauge theory. Other dimensionless parameters are ${O}(1)$ in the unit of the EW scale for the naturalness. This framework predicts a light PQ Higgs boson with a mass $\sim (\mathrm{EW~scale})^2 / f_a$. Exotic particles associated with the PQ anomaly are expected to have masses around the EW scale. The proposed model alleviates both the PQ quality and EW scale fine-tuning problems and introduces interesting axion-PQ Higgs cosmologies, encompassing: slim axion DM from a fat string network, heavy axion DM from PQ Higgs condensate fragmentation, PQ Higgs DM, and axion-PQ Higgs co-DM scenarios. Potential experimental signatures are explored, including fifth-force tests, DM detections, accelerator searches, and gravitational wave observations by employing lattice simulation. Possible extensions of the scenario are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Newly calculated bounds on the strength of the coupling of an electron to a proton or a neutron by a fifth force are presented. These results are derived from the high precision spectroscopic data currently available for hydrogen, deuterium, helium-3 and helium-4. They do not depend on specific assumptions on how the interaction would couple to a deuteron compared to a proton or would couple to an $\alpha$ particle compared to a helion. They depend on its coupling to a muon, but not in a significant way for carrier masses below 100~keV if one assumes that the strength of the interaction with a muon would be of a similar order of magnitude as the strength of the interaction with an electron in that mass region.</description>

      <title>A complete analysis of inflation with piecewise quadratic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough study of the comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ in single-field inflation with two stages, represented by a piecewise quadratic potential, where both the first and second derivatives are allowed to be discontinuous at the transition point. We calculate the evolution of $\mathcal{R}$ by combining the perturbative and non-perturbative methods consistently, and obtain the power spectrum and the non-Gaussian features in the probability distribution function. We find that both the spectrum and the statistics of $\mathcal{R}$ depend significantly on the second derivatives of the potential at both the first and second stages. Furthermore, we find a new parameter constructed from the potential parameters, which we call $\alpha$, plays a decisive role in determining various features in the spectrum such as the amplitude, the slope, and the existence of a dip. In particular, we recover the typical $k^4$ growth of the spectrum in most cases, but the maximum growth rate of $k^5(\log k)^2$ can be obtained by fine-tuning the parameters. Then, using the $\delta N$ formalism valid on superhorizon scales, we give fully nonlinear formulas for $\cal{R}$ in terms of the scalar field perturbation $\delta\phi$ and its time derivative. In passing, we point out the importance of the nonlinear evolution of $\delta\phi$ on superhorizon scales. Finally, using the Press-Schechter formalism for simplicity, we discuss the effect of the non-Gaussian tails of the probability distribution function on the primordial black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry as a gauge theory of gravity: covariant equations of motion &amp; conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Weyl conformal geometry as a general gauge theory of the Weyl group (of Poincar\'e and dilatations symmetries) in a manifestly Weyl gauge covariant formalism in which this geometry is (automatically) metric and physically relevant. This gives a realistic (quadratic) gauge theory of gravity, with Einstein-Hilbert gravity and a (positive) cosmological constant recovered in its spontaneously broken phase. For the most general action we compute the manifestly Weyl gauge covariant equations of motion and present the conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and Weyl gauge current. These laws are valid both in Weyl conformal geometry (with respect to the Weyl gauge covariant derivative) but also in the Riemannian geometry equivalent picture (with respect to its associated covariant derivative). This interesting result is a consequence of (gauged) diffeomorphism invariance of the former versus usual diffeomorphism invariance of the latter. These results are first derived for $d=4$ dimensions and are then extended to conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions while automatically maintaining manifest Weyl gauge invariance/covariance. The results are useful in physical applications with this symmetry.</description>

      <title>Returning Back to Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have re-examined Mukhanov parametrization for inflationary equation of state $1+\omega=\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, in the light of Planck 2018 results and latest bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio employing Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We have found the current observational values of scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can be used efficiently to constrain the model parameters. The recent findings of $r&lt;0.032$ has been used to put an upper bound on one of the model parameter. Whereas the $1-\sigma$ bound of the scalar spectral index $0.9607\leq n_{_S}\leq 0.9691$ along with the upper bound of scalar-to-tensor ratio provided restriction on the other model parameter $1.50\leq\alpha\leq2.20$. This bound depends on the number of e-foldings still left before the end of inflation and whenever $1.50\leq\alpha\leq2.20$ we can find appropriate values of the other model parameter $\beta$ so that the observational predictions are in tune with the latest available inflationary observables.</description>

      <title>Application of 3D U-Net Neural Networks in Extracting the Epoch of Reionization Signal from SKA-Low Observations Based on Real Observations of NCP Field from LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen serves as a crucial probe for the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Actual observations of the 21-cm signal often encounter challenges such as thermal noise and various systematic effects. To overcome these challenges, we simulate SKA-Low-depth images and process them with a deep learning method. We utilized foreground residuals acquired by LOFAR during actual North Celestial Pole field observations, thermal and excess variances calculated via Gaussian process regression, and 21-cm signals generated with 21cmFAST for signal extraction tests. Our approach to overcome these foreground, thermal noise, and excess variance components employs a 3D U-Net neural network architecture for image analysis. When considering thermal noise corresponding to 1400 hours of integration, U-Net provides reliable 2D power spectrum predictions, and robustness tests ensure that we get realistic EoR signals. Adding foreground residuals, however, causes inconsistencies below the horizon delay-line. Lastly, evaluating both thermal and excess variance with observations up to 3700 and 14000 hours ensures reliable power spectrum estimations within the EoR window and across nearly all scales, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Python package together with a practical guide for the implementation of a lightweight diversity-enhanced genetic algorithm (GA) approach for the exploration of multi-dimensional parameter spaces. Searching a parameter space for regions with desirable properties, e.g. compatibility with experimental data, poses a type of optimization problem wherein the focus lies on pinpointing all "good enough" solutions, rather than a single "best solution". Our approach dramatically outperforms random scans and other GA-based implementations in this aspect. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to a particle physics problem, showcasing its ability to identify promising parameter points in isolated, viable regions meeting experimental constraints. The companion Python package is applicable to optimization problems beyond those considered in this work, including scanning over discrete parameters (categories). A detailed guide for its usage is provided.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical formalism for calculating first-order in opacity radiative energy loss, incorporating the spatial and temporal temperature evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in a finite-size QCD medium with dynamical (i.e., moving) constituents. The derived expressions allow for the inclusion of arbitrary temperature profiles, enabling detailed calculations of radiative energy loss across various evolution scenarios. This advancement is crucial for utilizing high-$p_\perp$ observables to constrain QGP properties through precision QGP tomography.</description>

      <title>Potential Surge Preheating: enhanced resonance from potential features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of local features in the inflationary potential on the preheating dynamics after inflation. We show that a small feature in the potential can enhance the resonance and bring the radiation-like state equation during preheating despite the inflationary potential being a quadratic one. Such localized features may naturally arise due to various physical effects without altering the large-scale predictions of the original model for cosmic microwave background (CMB) observables. We demonstrate that these features effectively introduce localized higher-power terms in the potential, significantly influencing the preheating dynamics $\unicode{x2013}$ a phenomenon we term potential surge preheating. We outline the resulting modifications in energy distribution among different components. We further show that these small-scale features leave detectable imprints in the form of gravitational wave signals. These signals influence CMB measurements of the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, offering a way to reconstruct the shape of the inflaton potential at small scales. Finally, we argue that these modifications to the scalar potential provide a framework to explore preheating dynamics and the fragmentation of scalar fields using simple scalar potentials.</description>

Taking advantage of existing data, we explore extracting form factors for vector final states using the narrow width approximation. Based on RBC/UKQCD's set of 2+1 flavour gauge field ensembles with Shamir domain-wall fermion and Iwasaki gauge field action, we study semileptonic $B_{(s)}$ decays using domain-wall fermions for light, strange and charm quarks, whereas bottom quarks are simulated with the relativistic heavy quark (RHQ) action. Exploratory results for $B_s \to D_s^* \ell \nu_\ell$ are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study using the distillation method to analyze the spectra of nucleon, nucleon-pion, and nucleon-pion-pion states in the positive-parity sector, as well as nucleon and nucleon-pion states in the negative-parity sector. The study uses seven domain-wall fermion ensembles with varying pion masses ($m_\pi = 139 - 279~\text{MeV}$), lattice spacings ($a^{-1} = 1.730~\text{GeV}$ and $a^{-1}=2.359~\text{GeV}$) and volumes ($m_\pi L = 3.8 - 7.5$). To address the large number of contractions in this project, we implemented an algorithm to automate the contraction of nucleon-pion correlation functions that contain an arbitrary number of pions. In the positive parity sector, we extrapolate the nucleon mass to the physical point. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the distillation method for baryonic quantities with a focus on multi-hadronic states and establishes a foundation for future work.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Quarkonia Spectral Functions in the Pseudoscalar Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkonia, the bound states of heavy quark-antiquark pairs, are important tools for studying the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this study, we examine the behavior of in-medium quarkonium bound states in the QGP by analyzing their spectral functions at two temperatures, $T = 220\,\textrm{MeV}$ and $T = 293\,\textrm{MeV}$. We use physics-motivated information to reconstruct the spectral function from the Euclidean lattice correlator. Near the threshold, the spectral function is estimated through a complex potential, determined non-perturbatively from Wilson line correlators. Our results show that the real part of the potential undergoes color screening above $T_{pc}$, while the imaginary part grows rapidly with increasing distance and temperature. For the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectral function, we use the perturbative vacuum spectral function, as the temperature effects are suppressed in this region. In the absence of a transport peak in the pseudoscalar channel, we find that this combination effectively describes the pseudoscalar correlator on the lattice, calculated using relativistic quark fields. Our results show that pseudoscalar charmonium ($\eta_c$) experiences significant thermal effects, as indicated by the broadening of the $\eta_c(1S)$ state. In contrast, the $\eta_b(1S)$ state remains intact, with a sharp bound state peak.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking inflation in non-minimal metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry-breaking inflation within the framework of metric-affine gravity. By introducing a non-minimal coupling, $\beta(\phi)\tilde{\cal R}$, between the Holst invariant and the inflaton, both small-field and large-field inflationary predictions can be brought into agreement with the latest observational constraints. Remarkably, even for sub-Planckian vacuum expectation values, appropriately chosen values of $\beta(\phi)$ enable viable inflation, a scenario previously considered unattainable.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Fixed-Angle Meson Scattering and the Constituent Counting Rule in Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy fixed-angle scattering of pions and $\rho$-mesons in a bottom-up holographic QCD model. To this end, we generalise the approach of Polchinski and Strassler arXiv:hep-th/0109174 to write an ansatz for meson scattering amplitudes based on superstring scattering amplitudes in asymptotically AdS space. We demonstrate that our generalisation of the Polchinski--Strassler proposal is necessary to describe $\rho$-meson scattering consistently with the Nambu--Goldstone boson equivalence theorem. Our results for pion and $\rho$-meson scattering amplitudes are in agreement with the constituent counting rule found in QCD. Moreover, our proposal for 2-to-2 scattering amplitudes provides a method for computing scattering angle dependence.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation and muon production in ultra-high energy cosmic ray particle collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisions of cosmic ray particles with ultra-high initial energies with nuclei in the atmosphere open a wide room for appearing of the novel dynamical features for multiparticle production processes. In particular, the pion-lasing behavior driven by Bose-Einstein condensation would result in the shift to larger multiplicities and, as consequence, could provide, in general, the enhanced yield of cosmic muons. In the present work the critical value of the space charged particle density for onset of Bose-Einstein condensation of the boson (pion) wave-packets into the same wave-packet state is estimated within the model with complete multiparticle symmetrization for the energy domain corresponded to the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR). Energy dependence of mean density of charged pions is evaluated for the cases of absent of the Bose-Einstein effects and for presence of laser-like behavior of pions. The possible influence of the Bose-Einstein condensation is discussed for the muon production in UHECR particle collisions with the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>On the role of soft gluons in collinear parton densities and parton shower event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of soft (non-perturbative) gluons in collinear parton densities and parton shower event generators is investigated with the Parton Branching method as a solution of the DGLAP evolution equations. It is found that soft gluons play a significant role.
  Within the Parton Branching frame, the Sudakov form factor can be split into a perturbative and non-perturbative part. The non-perturbative part can be calculated analytically under certain conditions. It is shown that the inclusion of soft (non-perturbative) gluons in the parton density evolution is essential for the proper cancellation of divergent terms. It is argued that the non-perturbative part of the Sudakov form factor has its correspondence in Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distributions. Within the Parton Branching approach, this non-perturbative Sudakov form factor is constrained by fits of inclusive, collinear parton densities.
  We show that the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor and soft gluon emissions are essential for inclusive distributions (collinear parton densities and Drell-Yan transverse momentum spectra). We also show by using Parton Branching TMD parton shower, that the effect of soft gluons plays essentially no role in final state hadron spectra and jets.</description>

      <title>Unitarity Bounds and Basis Transformations in SMEFT: An Analysis of Warsaw and SILH Bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equivalence between the Warsaw and SILH bases in Standard Model Effective Field Theory is well established, with transformation rules connecting the two via equations of motion and field redefinitions. This study presents an explicit calculation of the analytical unitarity bounds-defined as the marginal limit of the parameter space-for dimension-six operators within both the Warsaw and SILH bases. We employ a coupled channel analysis to scrutinize scattering processes involving vector bosons and fermions. We conduct a comprehensive investigation into the transformation of unitarity bounds under changes in the operator basis. Our findings demonstrate that the transformation rules, as implicated by the equivalence theorem, can be directly applied to convert unitarity bounds from one basis to another, provided that the operators involved in the transformation rules do not belong to the same subset defined by a block in the coupled channel matrix.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Heavy Neutral Lepton Searches at Short and Medium Baseline Reactor Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy neutrinos with masses in the MeV range can in principle simultaneously explain the light neutrino masses and the origin of baryonic matter in the universe. The strongest constraints on their properties come from their potential impact on the formation of light elements in the early universe. Since these constraints rely on assumptions about the cosmic history, independent checks in the laboratory are highly desirable. In this paper, we discuss the opportunity to search for heavy neutrinos within the MeV mass range in short and medium baseline reactor neutrino experiments, using the SoLid, JUNO and TAO experiments as examples. These experiments can give the currently strongest upper bound on the mixing between the light electron neutrinos and the heavy neutrino in the 2-9 MeV mass range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first proof-of-concept application to decay processes at higher perturbative orders of LTD causal unitary, a novel methodology that exploits the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in the loop-tree duality (LTD) and is directly well-defined in the four physical dimensions of the space-time. The generation of loop- and tree-level contributions to the differential decay rates from a kernel multiloop vacuum amplitude is shown in detail, and explicit expressions are presented for selected processes that are suitable for a lightweight understanding of the method. Specifically, we provide a clear physical interpretation of the local cancellation of soft, collinear and threshold singularities, and of the local renormalisation of ultraviolet singularities. The presentation is illustrated with numerical results that showcase the advantages of the method.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark dominance and fine structure of excited heavy baryons $\Sigma_{Q}$, $\Xi '_{Q}$ and $\Omega_{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the relativized quark model, the calculation of spin-orbit interactions is improved by considering the contribution from the light quark cluster in a singly heavy baryon. It modifies the energy level splitting of the orbital excitation significantly and causes the emergence of fine structures for $\Sigma_{Q}$, $\Xi '_{Q}$ and $\Omega_{Q}$ baryons. Based on this improvement, we systematically analyze the fine structures and retest the heavy quark dominance mechanism. This mechanism is found to be violated in the $1P$-wave states of the $\Sigma_{c}$, $\Xi '_{c}$ and $\Omega_{c}$ baryons although it remains effective overall, which may help to understand the nature of the heavy quarks and strong interactions. With the predicted fine structures, we make the precise assignments of those observed heavy baryons which once could not be accurately explained due to their close mass values. The method used in this work is instructive and applicable for the study of more complex exotic hadrons, such as the heavy tetraquarks and pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>Form factors of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ within light-cone QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we calculated the form factors of the weak decay process $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$, where the final charm baryon represents an excited state with spin-parity $\frac{1}{2}^-$. Utilizing the light-cone QCD sum rules approach, we incorporated the contributions of the lowest two charm baryon states: the ground state $\Lambda_c$ with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+$ and the excited state $\Lambda_c(2595)^+$ with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ in the hadronic representation of the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ transition correlation function. This approach allows us to extract the form factors of the $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ from $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^+$ transition. During the light-cone QCD sum rules procedure, we employed the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon. Furthermore, by combining these form factors with the helicity amplitudes of the bottom baryon transition matrix elements, we calculated the differential decay widths for the processes $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\ell^-\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and provided the optimal choice of the interpolating current for $\Lambda_c$ in this process. Additionally, within the lifetime of $\Lambda_b^0$, we obtained the absolute branching fractions for the semileptonic decays $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$. With the branching fractions of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ calculated in this work, we also determined the parameter $R(\Lambda_c(2595)^+)$ which tests the lepton flavor universality. This parameter is defined as the ratio of branching fractions $Br(\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\tau^-\bar{\nu}_\tau)$ and $Br(\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\mu^-\bar{\nu}_\mu)$. Our results provide a valuable theoretical test for these decay channels and offer insights into the LCDAs of bottom baryons, paving the way for further in-depth investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the minimal extended seesaw mechanism with one sterile neutrino in a 3+1 framework using modular $S_3$ symmetry. The active-sterile neutrino models are classified based on the assignments of $S_3$ representations and modular weights of the left-handed lepton doublets, triplet right-handed neutrino, and sterile neutrino. No scalar flavons are considered, and the flavor symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the modulus $\tau$. For a particular set of representations of the Leptons and Higgs field, we obtain eleven (11) different models based on different modular weights of charged lepton $(k_L)$ and right-handed neutrino ($k_N$). Out of these, we consider two models, which are discriminated by carrying out the numerical analysis so that the parameter space in each model can fit the latest neutrino oscillation data at 3$\sigma$. The Planck cosmological bound on the upper limit of the sum of the active neutrino masses $\sum m_i &lt;0.12$eV is also considered. Finally, the best-fit parameters of the neutrino observables and model predictions are evaluated using the minimum $\chi^2$ analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate ultra-high frequency gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitons generated during inflationary reheating. Specifically, we study inflaton scattering with its decay product, where the couplings involved in this $2 \to 2$ scattering are the same as those in the $1 \to 3$ graviton Bremsstrahlung process. We compute the graviton production rate via such $2 \to 2$ scattering. Additionally, we compare the resulting GW spectrum with that from Bremsstrahlung as well as that from pure $2 \to 2$ inflaton scatterings. For completeness, the GW spectrum from graviton pair production through one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is also analyzed. With a systematic comparison among the four sources of GWs, we find that $2 \to 2$ inflaton scattering with its decay product can dominate over Bremsstrahlung if the reheating temperature is larger than the inflaton mass. Pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering is typically subdominant compared to Bremsstrahlung except in the high-frequency tail. The contribution from one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is shown to be suppressed compared to Bremsstrahlung and pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering.</description>

Abstract: The spin tensor is fundamental to relativistic spin hydrodynamics, but its definition is ambiguous due to the pseudogauge symmetry. We show that this ambiguity can be solved in interacting field theories. We prove that the mean-field limit of a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with spin-spin interactions is equivalent to nondissipative spin hydrodynamics with a canonical spin tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: R-parity can be extended to a continuous global U(1)${}_R$ symmetry. We investigate whether an anomalous U(1)${}_R$ can be identified as the PQ symmetry suitable for solving the strong CP problem within supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. In this case, U(1)${}_R$ is broken at some intermediate scale and the QCD axion is the R-axion. Moreover, the R-symmetry can be naturally gauged via the Green-Schwartz mechanism within completions to supergravity, thus evading the axion quality problem. Obstacles to realizing this scenario are highlighted and phenomenologically viable approaches are identified.</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic form factors and spin polarization of $\Lambda_c^+$ in the process $e^+ e^- \to \Lambda^+_c \bar{\Lambda}^-_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The total cross sections of the process $e^+ e^-\to \Lambda_c^+ \bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ close to the threshold are calculated within the vector meson dominance model. It is found that the theoretical results can describe the current experimental measurements. In particular, the results for the angular distribution parameters about the differential cross section are consistent with the experiments from BESIII Collaboration. In addition, the relative phase $\Delta \Phi$ of the electromagnetic form factors was given, and the spin polarization of $\Lambda_c^+$ is predicted at center-mass energy $4.7 \ \rm GeV$. It is hopeful to provide a new perspective on the characteristics of the charmed baryon $\Lambda_c^+$.</description>

      <title>How the Contact Can Produce Snowballs from Hell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A loosely bound hadronic molecule produced by a relativistic heavy-ion collision has been described as a "snowball in hell" since it emerges from a hadron gas whose temperature is orders of magnitude larger than the binding energy of the molecule. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained in terms of a novel thermodynamic variable called the "contact" that is conjugate to the binding momentum of the molecule. The production rate of the molecule can be expressed in terms of the contact density at the kinetic freezeout of the hadron gas. It approaches a nonzero limit as the binding energy goes to 0.</description>

      <title>Three-Loop OPE Wilson Coefficients of Dimension-Four Operators for (Axial-)Vector and (Pseudo-)Scalar Current Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the three-loop Wilson coefficients of all physically relevant dimension-four operators, i.e. $G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{a,\mu\nu}$, $m_i\bar q_j q_j$ and $m_i m_j m_k^2$, in the short-distance expansion of the time-ordered product of a pair of gauge-singlet vector, axial-vector, scalar and pseudo-scalar currents. The results are given for a general non-Abelian gauge theory with arbitrary (compact semi-simple) gauge group and $n_f$ light fermion flavors (quarks) in a common arbitrary representation of the gauge group, which includes QCD as a special case. In particular, we allow for arbitrary flavor contents of each of the currents. For the axial-vector current the included contributions from so-called singlet diagrams are consistent with the one-loop axial anomaly.</description>

Abstract: In light of the recent data for $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D^{(*)}_{(s)}P$ and $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}V$ decays, we perform a model-independent phenomenological analysis in the presence of quasi-elastic rescattering. With the Wilson coefficients including contributions beyond the standard model, lifetimes of $B$ meson as well as the $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing are investigated for clarifying correlations among the observables. We show that parameter regions for quasi-elastic rescattering, the size of color-suppressed tree amplitudes and new physics are constrained due to the lifetime data. As a consequence, it is revealed that this scenario can be testable by the future LHCb measurement of width difference in $B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d$ mixing and semi-leptonic CP asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrinophilic mediators at FASER$\nu$, FLArE and FASER$\nu$2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High energy collider neutrinos have been observed for the first time by the FASER$\nu$ experiment. The detected spectrum of collider neutrinos scattering off nucleons can be used to probe neutrinophilic mediators with GeV-scale masses. We find that constraints on the pseudoscalar (axial vector) neutrinophilic mediator are close to the scalar (vector) case since they have similar cross section in the neutrino massless limit. We perform an analysis on the measured muon spectra at FASER$\nu$, and find that the bounds on the vector mediator from the current FASER$\nu$ data are comparable to the existing bounds at $m_{Z^\prime}\approx 0.2$ GeV. We also study the sensitivities to a neutrinophilic mediator at future Forward Physics Facilities including FLArE and FASER$\nu$2 by using both the missing transverse momentum and the charge identification information. We find that FLArE and FASER$\nu$2 can impose stronger bounds on both the scalar and vector neutrinophilic mediators than the existing bounds. The constraints on the scalar mediator can reach 0.08 (0.1) for $m_\phi\lesssim1$ GeV with (without) muon charge identification at FASER$\nu$2.</description>

      <title>Medium modifications of heavy-flavor jet angularities in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of heavy-flavor jet angularities ($\lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha}$) in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV. The initial production of heavy-flavor jets is carried out using the POWHEG+PYTHIA8 prescription, while the jet evolution in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described by the SHELL transport model. In p+p collisions, we observe narrower angularity distributions for D$^0$-tagged jets compared to inclusive jets, consistent with the ALICE preliminary results. We then demonstrate that jet quenching in the QGP slightly widens the angularity distribution of D$^0$-tagged jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to that in p+p collisions for jet transverse momentum of $10 &lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c, while the angularity distributions of inclusive and D$^0$-tagged jets become narrower in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p at $p_{\rm T,jet} &gt; 20$ GeV/c due to the strong influence of the selection bias. Additionally, by comparing the average angularities $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ of inclusive, D$^0$-tagged and B$^0$-tagged jets with varying $\alpha$ and $\kappa$, we show that the larger the quark mass is, the lower the jet's $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ values are. As a result of the slenderer initial distribution, we predict that as compared to inclusive jets, the heavy-flavor jets, especially the B$^0$-tagged ones, will suffer stronger modifications of $\langle \lambda^{\kappa}_{\alpha} \rangle$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p at $10 &lt; p_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 20$ GeV/c. For a larger jet radius, a more significant broadening of jet angularities is predicted because of the enhanced contributions of the wide-angle particles.</description>

      <title>Indirect production of doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}$ at high energy colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The indirect production mechanisms of doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ through three decay channels, Higgs$/Z^{0}\to \langle cc\rangle_{\bar{3}} +\bar{c}+\bar{c} \to T_{cc}^{\bar{q}\bar{q^{\prime}}} +\bar{c}+\bar{c} $ and $W^+\to \langle cc\rangle_{\bar{3}}+\bar{c}+\bar{s} \to T_{cc}^{\bar{q}\bar{q^{\prime}}} +\bar{c}+\bar{s} $, are analyzed within the framework of NRQCD. The intermediate $\langle cc\rangle_{\bar{3}}$ diquark cluster in color-antitriplet evolves into tetraquark components via the fragmentation process by trapping two light antiquarks ($\bar{q}$ and $\bar{q^{\prime}}$) from the vacuum. After the considered doubly charmed tetraquark components are summed, including $T_{cc}^{\bar{u} \bar{u}}$, $T_{cc}^{\bar{u} \bar{d}}$, $T_{cc}^{\bar{d} \bar{d}}$, $T_{cc}^{\bar{u}\bar{s}}$, and $T_{cc}^{\bar{d}\bar{s}}$, the decay widths, branching ratios, and produced events per year for the production of $T_{cc}$ can be predicted at LHC and CEPC, respectively. The differential distributions and two main sources of theoretical uncertainty are also discussed. The results show that the produced events per year for $T_{cc}$ via $W^{+}$ decays is $1.80\times10^5$, nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that by Higgs decays ($1.11\times10^{3}$) and $Z^{0}$ decays ($4.81\times10^3$) at LHC. However at CEPC, the largest contribution for the production of $T_{cc}$ is through $Z^{0}$ decays, about $1.63\times10^6$. There are only $4.79\times10^{-1}$ and $2.03\times10^{2}$ $T_{cc}$ events produced per year at CEPC through Higgs and $W^+$ decay, respectively.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark hybrid model, modular transformation and Roberge-Weiss transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic neutrinos and the question of Dirac vs. Majorana neutrino nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding out if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is known to be extremely difficult. This is generally believed to be due to the smallness of the neutrino mass compared to typical neutrino energies, and to the fact that in the limit of vanishing mass all distinctions between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos disappear. This, however, does not necessarily mean that for non-relativistic neutrinos distinguishing between them is an easy task. We consider this problem in detail. The issues discussed include the possibilities of studying neutrino nature with non-relativistic neutrinos produced in $\beta$ decay in direct neutrino mass measurement experiments, with relic neutrinos, as well as with slow neutrinos in pair production processes and in scattering, both elastic and inelastic. We also discuss processes allowed for only one of the two neutrino types as a means of uncovering neutrino nature.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytic calculation of three-loop four-point Feynman integrals with two off-shell legs of equal mass. We provide solutions to the canonical differential equations of two integral families in both Euclidean and physical regions. They are validated numerically against independent computations. A total of 170 master integrals are expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms up to weight six. Most of them are computed for the first time. Our results are essential ingredients of the scattering amplitudes for equal-mass diboson production at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: We report on the reactions $\psi(3770)\to \bar{\Omega}^+ \bar{K} \Xi $ and $\psi(3770)\to \bar{\Omega}^+ \bar{K}\Xi^*(1530)~(\Xi^*(1530)\to \pi\Xi $), and calculate the mass distributions $\frac{{\rm d}\Gamma}{{\rm d}M_\text{inv}(\bar{K}\Xi)}$ and $\frac{{\rm d}\Gamma}{{\rm d}M_\text{inv}(\bar{K}\Xi^*)}$, respectively. We obtain clear peaks corresponding to the $\Omega(2012)$. From the decay of $\psi(3770)\to \bar{\Omega}^+ \bar{K}\Xi^*$, we also get a second, broader, peak around $2035\,\rm MeV$, which comes from the $\Omega(2012)$ decay to $\bar{K}\Xi^*$. This second peak is closely tied to the molecular picture of the $\Omega(2012)$ with the $\bar{K}\Xi^*(1530)$ and $\eta\Omega$ components. Its observation would provide a boost to the molecular picture of the $\Omega(2012)$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Lorentz-Equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr) yields state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of machine learning tasks at the Large Hadron Collider. L-GATr represents data in a geometric algebra over space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations. The underlying architecture is a versatile and scalable transformer, which is able to break symmetries if needed. We demonstrate the power of L-GATr for amplitude regression and jet classification, and then benchmark it as the first Lorentz-equivariant generative network. For all three LHC tasks, we find significant improvements over previous architectures.</description>

      <title>Tribute to Henry Primakoff: Tests of Chiral Perturbation Theory via Primakoff Reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Henry Primakoff founded a field of study based on the scattering of very high energy particles (pions, kaons, $\gamma$ gamma-rays) from the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus. Effectively, the Coulomb field acts like a target of $\gamma^*$ virtual photons, with target density proportional to $Z^2$. Primakoff was the first to describe how to determine the $\pi^0$ lifetime by measuring the $\gamma\gamma^*\to\pi^0$ production cross section. For the case that a high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam is used, Primakoff scattering, viewed in the rest frame of the pion, is effectively low-energy soft scattering of $\approx$ 250 MeV gamma rays from a pion at rest. Together, low-energy soft scattering and high-energy hard scattering studies play crucial complementary roles in testing the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) framework. OBJECTIVES: This article presents a short description of Primakoff's scientific career and personal life. It reviews Primakoff scattering studies of pion polarizability and the chiral anomaly $\gamma \rightarrow \pi \pi \pi$ at CERN COMPASS and the $\pi^0$ lifetime study at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). A review of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) is presented. RESULTS: We discuss the good agreement of these studies with 2-flavor (u,d) ChPT predictions. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss why Primakoff studies at CERN AMBER and JLab will be important for validating the theoretical framework of 3-flavor (u, d, s) ChPT. These include the kaon polarizability, $\gamma\to\pi\pi\eta$ and $\gamma\to KK\pi$ chiral anomalies, kaonic hybrid states, and $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ lifetimes. DISCUSSION: By comparing 3-flavor ChPT predictions with data for kaons, $\pi^0$ and $\eta$, it will be possible to assess how well the model captures the interplay of the additional flavor and the effects of strange quarks.</description>

      <title>The curtain lowers on directly detectable higgsino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A higgsino could be some or all of the dark matter, with a mass bounded from above by about 1.1 TeV assuming a thermal freezeout density, and from below by collider searches. Direct detection experiments imply purity constraints on a dark matter higgsino, limiting the mixing with the electroweak gauginos. Using the new strong limits available as of the end of 2024 from the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment, I quantify the resulting lower bounds on gaugino masses and upper bounds on higgsino mass splittings, assuming that the scalar superpartners and Higgs bosons of minimal supersymmetry are in the decoupling limit. Similar bounds are projected for the critical future scenario that direct detection experiments reach the neutrino fog that hampers discovery prospects.</description>

      <title>Screening masses of positive- and negative-parity hadron ground-states, including those with strangeness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) at nonzero temperature, we compute the screening masses of flavour-SU(3) ground-state $J^P=0^\pm$, $1^\pm$ mesons, and $J^P=1/2^\pm$, $3/2^\pm$ baryons. We find that all correlation channels allowed at $T=0$ persist when the temperature increases, even above the QCD phase transition. The results for mesons qualitatively agree with those obtained from the contemporary lattice-regularised quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) simulations. One of the most remarkable features is that each parity-partner-pair degenerates when $T&gt;T_c$, with $T_c$ being the critical temperature. For each pair, the screening mass of the negative parity meson increases monotonously with temperature. In contrast, the screening mass of the meson with positive parity is almost invariant on the domain $T\lesssim T_c/2$; when $T$ gets close to $T_c$, it decreases but soon increases again and finally degenerates with its parity partner, which signals the restoration of chiral symmetry. We also find that the $T$-dependent behaviours of baryon screening masses are quite similar to those of the mesons. For baryons, the dynamical, nonpointlike diquark correlations play a crucial role in the screening mass evolution. We further calculate the evolution of the fraction of each kind of diquark within baryons respective to temperature. We observe that, at high temperatures, only $J=0$ scalar and pseudoscalar diquark correlations can survive within $J^P=1/2^\pm$ baryons.</description>

      <title>A holographic study on QCD phase transition and neutron star properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD phase transition and its phase structure within Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system and compare the results with those obtained from the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton system. It is shown that both models reproduce behavior consistent with lattice QCD. In particular, the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system exhibits a first-order phase transition in the pure gauge sector, aligning with predictions from Yang-Mills theory. Based on these models, we construct a holographic model for neutron stars, incorporating leptons to satisfy electric charge neutrality, and examine the cold equation of state, the mass-radius relation, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. It is demonstrated that the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-scalar system enables us to describe neutron star properties that meet current astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Reexamining constraints on neutron star properties from perturbative QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implications of perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations on neutron stars are carefully examined. While pQCD calculations above baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B\simeq2.4$ GeV demonstrate the potential of ruling out a wide range of neutron star equations of state (EOSs), such constraints only affect the most massive neutron stars in the vicinity of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) limit, resulting in constraints that are orthogonal to current or expected astrophysical bounds. In the most constraining scenario, pQCD considerations favor low values of the squared speed sound $C_s$ at high $\mu_B$ relevant for the most massive neutron stars, but leave predictions of the radii and tidal deformabilities almost unchanged. Such considerations become irrelevant if the maximum speed of sound squared inside neutron stars does not exceed about $C_{s,\mathrm{max}}\simeq0.5$, or if pQCD breaks down below $\mu_B\simeq2.9$ GeV. Furthermore, the large pQCD uncertainties preclude any meaningful bounds on the neutron star EOS at the moment. Interestingly, if pQCD predictions for the pressure at around $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV are refined and found to be low ($\lesssim 1.5$ GeV/fm$^3$), evidence for a soft neutron star inner core EOS in combination with the existence of two-solar-mass pulsars would indicate the presence of color superconductivity beyond neutron star densities. We point out that two-solar-mass pulsars place robust upper bounds on this non-perturbative effect and require the pairing gap to be less than $\Delta_\mathrm{CFL}\lesssim500$ MeV at $\mu_B\simeq2.5$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Spin couplings as witnesses of Planck scale phenomenology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified dispersion relations (MDRs) and noncommutative geometries are phenomenological models of Planck-scale corrections to relativistic kinematics, motivated by several approaches to quantum gravity. High-energy astrophysical observations, while commonly used to test such effects, are limited by significant systematic uncertainties. In contrast, low-energy, nonrelativistic experiments provide greater control, with precision serving as an amplifier for Planck-suppressed corrections. We derive corrections to Pauli's equation for nonrelativistic spin-1/2 particles in a magnetic field, incorporating general MDRs and noncommutative geometries. Applying our framework to k-Poincar\'e symmetries and minimal-length quantum mechanics, we identify Planck-scale corrections accessible in the nonrelativistic regime. Using the electron's anomalous magnetic moment, we constrain model parameters, pushing the k-Poincar\'e scale in the bi-crossproduct representation beyond $10^{10}$ GeV. These results highlight the complementarity of low-energy precision tests and astrophysical observation in probing quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Natural Inflation with Gauge Field Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The natural inflation model with a periodic cosine potential is ruled out by recent Planck 2018 data for the decay constant $f \lesssim 5.5~M_{\rm Pl}$. If the Planck data is combined with the BICEP Keck array and BAO data, the model is excluded (at $2$-$\sigma$) for all values of $f$. In this context, we revisit the model when the pseudoscalar inflation $\phi$ is coupled with a gauge field via a coupling of the form $\frac{\alpha}{f} \phi F \tilde{F}$, where $F (\tilde F)$ denotes the gauge field (dual) strength tensor, and $\alpha$ is the coupling constant. The back-reactions associated with the gauge field production during the later stages of inflation extend the duration of inflation. We numerically evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the perturbations in the inflaton field. It allows us to determine the scalar and tensor power spectra leading to the calculations of observables at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales. We find that the natural inflation model survives the test of the latest data only for a certain range of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our analysis shows that the latest constraints coming from the scalar spectral index are more stringent than the ones arising from the non-gaussianities and the running of the scalar spectrum. This leads to lower and upper bounds on $\xi_*$, the parameter that controls the growth of the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent chirality as a smoking gun for Abelian gauge fields during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-inflation models are a compelling candidate as a mechanism behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe in light of the possibility to embed them in higher dimensional UV complete theories and the exciting prospect of testing them with next-generation cosmological probes. Adding an Abelian gauge sector to axion-inflation models makes for a rich, interesting, phenomenology spanning from primordial black holes to gravitational waves (GWs). Several recent studies employ an approximate analytic (Gaussian) template to characterize the effect of gauge field production on cosmological perturbations. In this work we go beyond such approximation and numerically study particle production and the ensuing scalar and tensor spectra. We find a significant deviation from results based on log-normally distributed vector field excitations. As an important phenomenological application of the improved method, we study the expected chirality and spectral index of the sourced GW background at scales relevant for current and next-generation GW detectors. One striking feature is that of a scale-dependent chirality. We derive a consistency relation between these two observables that can serve as an important tool in identifying key signatures of multi-field dynamics in axion inflation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from High Temperature Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study finite temperature effects in string cosmology and their potential gravitational wave signature. Expanding on our recent work arXiv:2310.11494 , we consider a general configuration of highly excited open and closed strings at high enough temperature to be in the Hagedorn phase in 3+1 dimensions, in order to explore its cosmological implications. We find conditions, which can be satisfied in compactifications with moduli stabilization, that allow the long strings to remain in equilibrium in a controlled effective field theory, with equilibration driven by the joining and splitting of the dominant open string population. We calculate the emission rate of gravitons by long open strings, which we show is determined by ten dimensional flat space transition amplitudes available in the literature, and then find the total gravitational wave spectrum generated by the gas of long strings. The gravitational wave spectrum has robust characteristics. It peaks at frequencies of order 50-100 GHz, the same as for gravitational waves from the reheating epoch of the Standard Model. But the amplitude of the string signal is significantly larger than predicted by the Standard Model and its field theoretic extensions. The amplitude and other physical observables (such as the contribution to $\Delta N_{\text eff}$) are directly proportional to the string scale $M_s$; indicating that a potential signal may also determine the string scale. Our calculations provide one of the few examples of a signal of stringy origin that dominates over the field theory predictions. We give a physical explanation of our results and discuss further implications.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization via irrelevant deformations induced by the stress-energy tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal{O}$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, we also deform the Lagrangians for scalar field theories.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain can be sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity governs the unification of all known elementary forces calls for an extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ reflects the internal $% SU(N)$ symmetry subgroup. This extension is shown to lead to a consistent hyperunification framework, provided that the tetrad fields of $SL(2,C)$ retain their invertibility condition in the extended theory, thus maintaining their connection to gravity. As a result, while the full gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ typically comprises vector, axial-vector, and tensor field submultiplets of $SU(N)$, only the vector submultiplet and the singlet tensor field manifest in the observed particle spectrum. The axial-vector submultiplet remains decoupled from ordinary matter, while the tensor submultiplet acquires the Planck scale order masses. Consequently, the effective symmetry of the theory reduces to $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$, bringing together $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity and $SU(N)$ grand unification. As all states in $SL(2N,C)$ are also classified by their spin, some $SU(N)$ grand unified models, including the standard $SU(5)$, appear unsuitable for the standard spin-1/2 quarks and leptons. However, applying $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to a model of composite quarks and leptons, where constituent chiral preons form the fundamental representations, identifies $SL(16,C)$ with its effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most compelling candidate for hyperunification of the existing fundamental forces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit axion monodromy inflation in the context of UV-complete theories and point out that its cosmological observables are sensitive to heavy fields with masses far above the Hubble scale, such as the moduli of flux compactifications. By studying a string-inspired two-field extension of axion monodromy, we reveal that the oscillatory modulation of the axion potential leads to continuous excitation of heavy fields during inflation when the modulation frequency exceeds the field masses. This finding challenges the conventional single-field description, as heavy moduli cannot be simply integrated out. Using a full bootstrap analysis, we demonstrate that this mechanism produces cosmological collider signals that bypass the usual Boltzmann suppression for heavy masses. Specifically, we identify detectably large signatures of heavy moduli in the primordial bispectrum, offering a promising avenue for probing high-energy physics through cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Double sine-Gordon class of universal coarsening dynamics in a spin-1 Bose gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, universal dynamics prevails in many different situations, from pattern coarsening to turbulence, while the understanding of its microscopic laws and classification has remained unsatisfactory. Here, universal scaling evolution reflected by coarsening in a multi-component Bose gas is traced back to a low-energy effective theory given by a double sine-Gordon (DSG) model for a single real scalar field. Our experimental observations of a rubidium spinor BEC support the applicability of this model. Evaluating the scaling evolution according to the low-energy effective model demonstrates the universal aspects of the scaling characteristics as compared with that of the spinor gas. The difference between diffusion-type and sub-diffusive scaling is shown to be connected to the occupation of minima within the DSG potential. Our results point to a path towards a microscopic description and classification of pattern coarsening in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Measurement of Lepton-Jet Azimuthal Angular Asymmetries in Deep-Inelastic Scattering at HERA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In deep-inelastic positron-proton scattering, the lepton-jet azimuthal angular asymmetry is measured using data collected with the H1 detector at HERA. When the average transverse momentum of the lepton-jet system, $\lvert \vec{P}_\perp \rvert $, is much larger than the total transverse momentum of the system, $\lvert \vec{q}_\perp \rvert$, the asymmetry between parallel and antiparallel configurations, $\vec{P}_\perp$ and $\vec{q}_\perp$, is expected to be generated by initial and final state soft gluon radiation and can be predicted using perturbation theory. Quantifying the angular properties of the asymmetry therefore provides an additional test of the strong force. Studying the asymmetry is important for future measurements of intrinsic asymmetries generated by the proton's constituents through Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), where this asymmetry constitutes a dominant background. Moments of the azimuthal asymmetries are measured using a machine learning method for unfolding that does not require binning.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions</title>

Abstract: The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [45] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the main dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.</description>
