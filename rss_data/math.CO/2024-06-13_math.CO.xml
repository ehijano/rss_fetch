      <title>A Central Limit Theorem on Two-Sided Descents of Mallows Distributed Elements of Finite Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mallows distribution is a non-uniform distribution, first introduced over permutations to study non-ranked data, in which permutations are weighted according to their length. It can be generalized to any Coxeter group, and we study the distribution of $\text{des}(w) + \text{des}(w^{-1})$ where $w$ is a Mallows distributed element of a finite irreducible Coxeter group. We show that the asymptotic behavior of this statistic is Guassian. The proof uses a size-bias coupling with Stein's method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every non-spherical set $X$ in $\mathbb{E}^d$, there exists a natural number $m$ and a red/blue-colouring of $\mathbb{E}^n$ for every $n$ such that there is no red copy of X and no blue progression of length $m$ with each consecutive point at distance $1$. This verifies a conjecture of Wu and the first author.</description>

      <title>Counting independent sets in structured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting independent sets in graphs and hypergraphs under a variety of restrictions is a classical question with a long history. It is the subject of the celebrated container method which found numerous spectacular applications over the years. We consider the question of how many independent sets we can have in a graph under structural restrictions. We show that any $n$-vertex graph with independence number $\alpha$ without $bK_a$ as an induced subgraph has at most $n^{O(1)} \cdot \alpha^{O(\alpha)}$ independent sets. This substantially improves the trivial upper bound of $n^{\alpha},$ whenever $\alpha \le n^{o(1)}$ and gives a characterization of graphs forbidding of which allows for such an improvement. It is also in general tight up to a constant in the exponent since there exist triangle-free graphs with $\alpha^{\Omega(\alpha)}$ independent sets. We also prove that if one in addition assumes the ground graph is chi-bounded one can improve the bound to $n^{O(1)} \cdot 2^{O(\alpha)}$ which is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent.</description>

      <title>Colouring isonemal fabrics with more than two colours and non-twilly redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfect colouring of isonemal fabrics by thin and thick striping of warp and weft with more than two colours is examined where the cells with warps and wefts of the same colour do not appear along diagonal lines (not twilly redundancy). In species 33 to 39, all fabrics of specific orders (linear periods) can be perfectly coloured by thin striping with satin redundancy. In fewer species, all fabrics of specific orders can be perfectly coloured by thick striping in two different ways with doubled satin redundancy. The isonemal fabric 6-1-1 can be used as a redundancy configuration. All these colourings allow the coloured weaving of flat tori and -- a few of them -- cubes.</description>

      <title>Walks, infinite series and spectral radius of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph G, the spectral radius \r{ho}(G) of G is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this paper, we seek the relationship between \r{ho}(G) and the walks of the subgraphs of G. Especially, if G contains a complete multi-partite graph as a spanning subgraph, we give a formula for \r{ho}(G) by using an infinite series on walks of the subgraphs of G. These results are useful for the current popular spectral extremal problem.</description>

      <title>Capacity bounds on integral flows and the Kostant partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type $A$ Kostant partition function is an important combinatorial object with various applications: it counts integer flows on the complete directed graph, computes Hilbert series of spaces of diagonal harmonics, and can be used to compute weight and tensor product multiplicities of representations. In this paper we study asymptotics of the Kostant partition function, improving on various previously known lower bounds and settling conjectures of O'Neill and Yip. Our methods build upon recent results and techniques of Br\"and\'en-Leake-Pak, who used Lorentzian polynomials and Gurvits' capacity method to bound the number of lattice points of transportation and flow polytopes. Finally, we also give new two-sided bounds using the Lidskii formulas from subdivisions of flow polytopes.</description>

      <title>Bound vertices of longest paths between two vertices in cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thomassen's chord conjecture from 1976 states that every longest cycle in a $3$-connected graph has a chord. This is one of the most important unsolved problems in graph theory. Let $H$ be a subgraph of a graph $G$. A vertex $v$ of $H$ is said to be $H$-bound if all the neighbors of $v$ in $G$ lie in $H$. Recently, Zhan has made the more general conjecture that in a $k$-connected graph, every longest path $P$ between two vertices contains at least $k-1$ internal $P$-bound vertices. In this paper, we prove that Zhan's conjecture holds for $2$-connected cubic graphs. This conclusion generalizes a result of Thomassen [{\em J. Combin. Theory Ser. B} \textbf{129} (2018) 148--157]. Furthermore, we prove that if the two vertices are adjacent, Zhan's conjecture holds for $3$-connected cubic graphs, from which we deduce that every longest cycle in a $3$-connected cubic graph has at least two chords. This strengthens a result of Thomassen [{\em J. Combin. Theory Ser. B} \textbf{71} (1997) 211--214].</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Isomorphism of Nonseparable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this monography, it is proposed to consider the concepts of spectra of edge cuts and edge cycles of a graph as a basic mathematical structure for solving the problem of graph isomorphism. An edge cut is defined by an edge and the vertices incident to it. In contrast to the generation of iterated edge graphs, we consider an iterated chain of qualicuts of the original graph, generated by edge cuts and determined by a recurrence relation. An edge cycle is defined by the set of isometric cycles of a graph. The monography examines the issues of constructing the spectrum of edge cuts Ws and the spectrum of edge cycles Tc of a graph G. It is shown that the formation of spectra is based on the incidence matrix of the graph. The independence of the construction of the graph structure from the numbering of vertices and edges is shown. The necessity and sufficiency of the spectra of edge cuts and the spectrum of edge cycles for determining the isomorphism of graph structures is shown. The relation between the internal structures of the graph and Whitney's theorem is considered.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of quasirandomness and exchangeable representations independent from lower-order variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often convenient to represent a process for randomly generating a graph as a graphon. (More precisely, these give \emph{vertex exchangeable} processes -- those processes in which each vertex is treated the same way.) Other structures can be treated by generalizations like hypergraphons, permutatons, and, for a very general class, theons. These representations are not unique: different representations can lead to the same probability distribution on graphs. This naturally leads to questions (going back at least to Hoover's proof of the Aldous--Hoover Theorem on the existence of such representations) that ask when quasirandomness properties on the distribution guarantee the existence of particularly simple representations.
  We extend the usual theon representation by adding an additional datum of a random permutation to each tuple, which we call a $\ast$-representation. We show that if a process satisfies the \emph{unique coupling} property UCouple[$\ell$], which says roughly that all $\ell$-tuples of vertices ``look the same'', then the process is $\ast$-$\ell$-independent: there is a $\ast$-representation that does not make use of any random information about $\ell$-tuples (including tuples of length $&lt;\ell$). Simple examples show that the use of $\ast$-representations is necessary.
  This resolves a question of Coregliano and Razborov, since it easily follows that UCouple[l] implies Independence[\ell'] (the existence of an $\ell'$-independent ordinary representation) for $\ell'&lt;\ell$.</description>

      <title>Toughness and spectral radius in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $t$ be a positive integer, and let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$ with $n\geq t+2$. A graph $G$ is said to be $\frac{1}{t}$-tough if $|S|\geq\frac{1}{t}c(G-S)$ for every subset $S$ of $V(G)$ with $c(G-S)\geq2$, where $c(G-S)$ is the number of connected components in $G-S$. The adjacency matrix of $G$ is denoted by $A(G)$. Let $\lambda_1(G)\geq\lambda_2(G)\geq\dots\geq\lambda_n(G)$ be the eigenvalues of $A(G)$. In particular, the eigenvalue $\lambda_1(G)$ is called the spectral radius of $G$. In this paper, we prove that $G$ is a $\frac{1}{t}$-tough graph unless $G=K_1\vee(K_{n-t-1}\cup tK_1)$ if $\lambda_1(G)\geq\eta(t,n)$, where $\eta(t,n)$ is the largest root of $x^{3}-(n-t-2)x^{2}-(n-1)x+t(n-t-2)=0$.</description>

      <title>Testing Quantum and Simulated Annealers on the Drone Delivery Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using drones to perform human-related tasks can play a key role in various fields, such as defense, disaster response, agriculture, healthcare, and many others. The drone delivery packing problem (DDPP) arises in the context of logistics in response to an increasing demand in the delivery process along with the necessity of lowering human intervention. The DDPP is usually formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to minimize drone usage with specific battery constraints while ensuring timely consistent deliveries with fixed locations and energy budget. In this work, we propose two alternative formulations of the DDPP as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, in order to test the performance of classical and quantum annealing (QA) approaches. We perform extensive experiments showing the advantages as well as the limitations of quantum annealers for this optimization problem, as compared to simulated annealing (SA) and classical state-of-the-art commercial tools for global optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a 2016 paper, Straub proved an analogue to Euler's partition identity for partitions with fixed perimeter. Later, Fu and Tang provided a refinement and generalization of Straub's analogue to $d$-distinct partitions as well as a result related to the first Rogers-Ramanujan identity. Motivated by Alder-type partition identities and their generalizations, we build on work of Fu and Tang to establish generalized Alder-type partition inequalities in a fixed perimeter setting, and notably, a reverse Alder-type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand upon the notion of bottlenecking introduced in our earlier work, characterizing a spectrum of graphs and showing this naturally extends to the concept of coarse bottlenecking. We examine how bottlenecking differs from other notions of connectedness. Notably we show how the notion of bottlenecking gives a natural coarse Menger-type conjecture, which is weaker than the Coarse Menger Conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu that has recently been disproved by a counter example.</description>

      <title>Random Combinatorial Billiards and Stoned Exclusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study several random combinatorial billiard trajectories. Such a system, which depends on a fixed parameter $p\in(0,1)$, models a beam of light that travels in a Euclidean space, occasionally randomly reflecting off of a hyperplane in the Coxeter arrangement of an affine Weyl group with some probability that depends on the side of the hyperplane that it hits. In one case, we (essentially) recover Lam's reduced random walk in the limit as $p$ tends to $0$. The investigation of our random billiard trajectories relies on an analysis of new finite Markov chains that we call stoned exclusion processes. These processes have remarkable stationary distributions determined by well-studied polynomials such as ASEP polynomials, inhomogeneous TASEP polynomials, and open boundary ASEP polynomials; in many cases, it was previously not known how to construct Markov chains with these stationary distributions. Using multiline queues, we analyze correlations in the stoned multispecies TASEP, allowing us to determine limit directions for reduced random billiard trajectories and limit shapes for new random growth processes for $n$-core partitions. Our perspective coming from combinatorial billiards naturally leads us to formulate a new variant of the ASEP on $\mathbb{Z}$ called the scan ASEP, which we deem interesting in its own right.</description>

Abstract: In [Fleurat, Salvy 2024], we introduced a model of block-weighted random maps that undergoes a phase transition as the density of separating elements changes. The purpose of this note is to demonstrate that the methodology we developed can be extended to many other families of maps. We prove that a phase transition exists and provide detailed information about the size of the largest blocks in each regime.</description>

      <title>A circle method approach to K-multimagic squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate $K$-multimagic squares of order $N$, these are $N \times N$ magic squares which remain magic after raising each element to the $k$th power for all $2 \le k \le K$. Given $K \ge 2$, we consider the problem of establishing the smallest integer $N_2(K)$ for which there exists non-trivial $K$-multimagic squares of order $N_2(K)$. Previous results on multimagic squares show that $N_2(K) \le (4K-2)^K$ for large $K$. Here we utilize the Hardy-Littlewood circle method and establish the bound \[N_2(K) \le 2K(K+1)+1.\]
  Via an argument of Granville's we additionally deduce the existence of infinitely many non-trivial prime valued $K$-multimagic squares of order $2K(K+1)+1$.</description>

Abstract: Association schemes on triples (ASTs) are ternary analogues of classical association schemes. Analogous to Schurian association schemes, ASTs arise from the actions of two-transitive groups. In this paper, we obtain the sizes and third valencies of the ASTs obtained from the two-transitive permutation groups by determining the orbits of the groups' two-point stabilizers. Specifically, we obtain these parameters for the ASTs obtained from the actions of $S_n$ and $A_n$, $PGU(3,q)$, $PSU(3,q)$, and $Sp(2k,2)$, $Sz(2^{2k+1})$ and $Ree(3^{2k+1})$, some subgroups of $A\Gamma L(k,n)$, some subgroups of $P\Gamma L(k,n)$, and the sporadic two-transitive groups. Further, we obtain the intersection numbers for the ASTs obtained from these subgroups of $P\Gamma L(k,n)$ and $A \Gamma L(k,n)$, and the sporadic two-transitive groups. In particular, the ASTs from these projective and sporadic groups are commutative.</description>

      <title>New Results on Edge-coloring and Total-coloring of Split Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A split graph is a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. A connected graph $G$ is said to be $t$-admissible if admits a special spanning tree in which the distance between any two adjacent vertices is at most $t$. Given a graph $G$, determining the smallest $t$ for which $G$ is $t$-admissible, i.e. the stretch index of $G$ denoted by $\sigma(G)$, is the goal of the $t$-admissibility problem. Split graphs are $3$-admissible and can be partitioned into three subclasses: split graphs with $\sigma=1, 2 $ or $3$. In this work we consider such a partition while dealing with the problem of coloring a split graph. Vizing proved that any graph can have its edges colored with $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$ colors, and thus can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2, respectively. When both, edges and vertices, are simultaneously colored, i.e., a total coloring of $G$, it is conjectured that any graph can be total colored with $\Delta+1$ or $\Delta+2$ colors, and thus can be classified as Type 1 or Type 2. These both variants are still open for split graphs. In this paper, using the partition of split graphs presented above, we consider the edge coloring problem and the total coloring problem for split graphs with $\sigma=2$. For this class, we characterize Class 2 and Type 2 graphs and we provide polynomial-time algorithms to color any Class 1 or Type 1 graph.</description>

      <title>Graph Burning: Bounds and Hardness</title>

Abstract: Graph burning models the propagation of information within a network as a stepwise process where at each step, one node becomes informed, and this information also spreads to all neighbors of previously informed nodes. Formally, graph burning is defined as follows: For an undirected graph $G$, at step $t=0$ all vertices in $G$ are unburned. At each step $t\ge 1$, one new unburned vertex is selected to burn if such a vertex exists. If a vertex is burned at step $t$, then all its unburned neighbors are burned in step $t+1$, and the process continues until there are no unburned vertices in $G$. The burning number of a graph $G$, denoted by $b(G)$, is the minimum number of steps required to burn all the vertices of $G$. The burning number problem asks whether the burning number of an input graph $G$ is at most $k$ or not. In this paper, we study the burning number problem both from an algorithmic and a structural point of view. The burning number problem is known to be NP-complete for trees with maximum degree at most three and interval graphs. Here, we prove that this problem is NP-complete even when restricted to connected cubic graphs and connected proper interval graphs. The well-known burning number conjecture asserts that all the vertices of a graph of order $n$ can be burned in $\lceil\sqrt{n}~\rceil$ steps. In line with this conjecture, upper and lower bounds of $b(G)$ are well-studied for various graph classes. Here, we provide an improved upper bound for the burning number of connected $P_k$-free graphs and show that the bound is tight up to an additive constant $1$. Finally, we study two variants of the problem, namely edge burning (only edges are burned) and total burning (both vertices and edges are burned). In particular, we establish their relationship with the burning number problem and evaluate the algorithmic complexity of these variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize classical triangular Schubert puzzles to puzzles with convex polygonal boundary. We give these puzzles a geometric Schubert calculus interpretation and derive novel combinatorial commutativity statements, using purely geometric arguments, for puzzles with four, five, and six sides, having various types of symmetry in their boundary conditions. We also present formulas for the associated structure constants in terms of Littlewood-Richardson numbers, and we prove an analogue of commutativity for parallelogram-shaped equivariant puzzles.</description>

      <title>On differences of two harmonic numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the existence of infinitely many $(m_k, n_k) \in \mathbb{N}^2$ such that the difference of harmonic numbers $H_{m_k} - H_{n_k}$ approximates 1 well $$ \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \left| \sum_{\ell = n}^{m_k} \frac{1}{\ell} - 1 \right|\cdot n_k^2 = 0.$$ This answers a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham. The construction uses asymptotics for harmonic numbers, the precise nature of the continued fraction expansion of $e$ and a suitable rescaling of a subsequence of convergents. We also prove a quantitative rate by appealing to techniques of Heilbronn, Danicic, Harman, Hooley and others regarding $\min_{1 \leq n \leq N} \min_{m \in \mathbb{N}}\| n^2 \theta - m\|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a drawing $D$ of a graph $G$, we define the crossing number between any two cycles $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ in $D$ to be the number of crossings that involve at least one edge from each of $C_1$ and $C_2$ except the crossings between edges that are common to both cycles. We show that if the crossing number between every two cycles in $G$ is even in a drawing of $G$ on the plane, then there is a planar drawing of $G$. This result can be extended to arbitrary surfaces. We also establish an equivalence between our result and a fundamental result due to Cairns-Nikolayevsky and Pelsmajer-Schaefer-\v{S}tefankovi\v{c}, about drawing graphs on surfaces, and derive the Loebl-Masbaum theorem from it.</description>

Abstract: The critical exponent of an infinite word $\bf x$ is the supremum, over all finite nonempty factors $f$, of the exponent of $f$. In this note we show that for all integers $k\geq 2,$ there is a binary infinite $k$-automatic sequence with critical exponent $\leq 7/3$. The same conclusion holds for Fibonacci-automatic and Tribonacci-automatic sequences.</description>

      <title>On Circuit Diameter Bounds via Circuit Imbalances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.07913v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the circuit diameter of polyhedra, introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold, and Hemmecke (SIDMA 2015) as a relaxation of the combinatorial diameter. We show that the circuit diameter of a system $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: Ax=b, 0\leq x\leq u\}$ for $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is bounded by $O(m \min\{m, n-m\} \log(m+ \kappa_A)+n \log n)$, where $\kappa_A$ is the circuit imbalance measure of the constraint matrix. This yields a strongly polynomial circuit diameter bound if e.g., all entries of $A$ have polynomially bounded encoding length in $n$. Further, we present circuit augmentation algorithms for LPs using the minimum-ratio circuit cancelling rule. Even though the standard minimum-ratio circuit cancelling algorithm is not finite in general, our variant can solve an LP in $O(mn^2\log(n+\kappa_A))$ augmentation steps.</description>

      <title>Storage codes on coset graphs with asymptotically unit rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A storage code on a graph $G$ is a set of assignments of symbols to the vertices such that every vertex can recover its value by looking at its neighbors. We consider the question of constructing large-size storage codes on triangle-free graphs constructed as coset graphs of binary linear codes. Previously it was shown that there are infinite families of binary storage codes on coset graphs with rate converging to 3/4. Here we show that codes on such graphs can attain rate asymptotically approaching 1. Equivalently, this question can be phrased as a version of hat-guessing games on graphs (e.g., P.J. Cameron e.a., \emph{Electronic J. Comb.} 2016). In this language, we construct triangle-free graphs with success probability of the players approaching one as the number of vertices tends to infinity. Furthermore, finding linear index codes of rate approaching zero is also an equivalent problem. Another family of storage codes on triangle-free graphs of rate approaching 1 was constructed earlier by A. Golovnev and I. Haviv (36th Computational Complexity Conf., 2021) relying on a different family of graphs.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotics of the Expected Betti Numbers of Preferential Attachment Clique Complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The preferential attachment model is a natural and popular random graph model for a growing network that contains very well-connected ``hubs''. We study the higher-order connectivity of such a network by investigating the topological properties of its clique complex. We concentrate on the expected Betti numbers, a sequence of topological invariants of the complex related to the numbers of holes of different dimensions. We determine the asymptotic growth rates of the expected Betti numbers, and prove that the expected Betti number at dimension 1 grows linearly fast, while those at higher dimensions grow sublinearly fast. Our theoretical results are illustrated by simulations. (Changes are made in this version to generalize Proposition 14 and to streamline proofs. These changes are shown in blue.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the singular numbers of a certain explicit continuous-time Markov jump process on $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, which we argue gives the closest $p$-adic analogue of multiplicative Dyson Brownian motion. We do so by explicitly classifying the possible dynamics of singular numbers of processes on $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ satisfying natural properties possessed by Brownian motion on $\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$. Computing the evolution of singular numbers explicitly, we find that the $N$-tuple of singular numbers in decreasing order evolves as a Poisson jump process on $\mathbb{Z}^N$, with ordering enforced by reflection off the walls of the positive type $A$ Weyl chamber. This contrasts with -- and provides a $p$-adic analogue to -- the behavior of classical Dyson Brownian motion, where ordering is enforced by conditioning to avoid the Weyl chamber walls.</description>

Abstract: We employ a mathematical model to analyze stress chains in thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) with a microphase-separated spherical structure composed of triblock copolymers. The model represents stress chains during uniaxial and biaxial extensions using networks of spherical domains connected by bridges. We advance previous research and discuss permanent strain and other aspects of the network. It explores the dependency of permanent strain on the extension direction, using the average of tension tensors to represent isotropic material behavior. The concept of deviation angle is introduced to measure network anisotropy and is shown to play an essential role in predicting permanent strain when a network is extended in a specific direction. The paper also discusses methods to create a new network structure using various polymers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13034v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. This random graph is a particular case of the soft random graph model introduced by Penrose, in which the probability between 2 vertices is a function that depends on the distance between them. In this article, we define models for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$, which also present randomness in all other dimensions. Furthermore, we study the homology of those random simplicial complexes in different regimes of $n,r$, and $p$ by giving asymptotic formulas for the expectation of the Betti numbers in the sparser regimes, and bounds in the denser regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted on the (co)homology of various models of random simplicial complexes. So far, it has always been examined merely as a list of groups. This paper expands upon this by describing both the ring structure and the Steenrod-algebra structure of the cohomology of the multiparametric models. For the lower model, we prove that the ring structure is always a.a.s trivial, while, for certain parameters, the Steenrod-algebra a.a.s acts non-trivially. This reveals that complex multi-dimensional topological structures appear as subcomplexes of this model. In contrast, we improve upon a result of Farber and Nowik, and assert that the cohomology of the upper multiparametric model is a.a.s concentrated in a single dimension.</description>

      <title>On $[1,2]$-Domination in Interval and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G=(V, E)$ is Dominating Set if each vertex in $V(G)\setminus S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $S$. Chellali et al. in 2013, by restricting the number of neighbors in $S$ of a vertex outside $S$, introduced the concept of $[1,j]$-dominating set. A set $D \subseteq V$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is called $[1,j]$-Dominating Set of $G$ if every vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor and at most $j$ neighbors in $D$. The Minimum $[1,j]$-Domination problem is the problem of finding the minimum set $D$. Given a positive integer $k$ and a graph $G = (V, E)$, the $[1,j]$-Domination Decision problem is to decide whether $G$ has $[1,j]$-dominating set of cardinality at most $k$. A polynomial-time algorithm was obtained in split graphs for a constant $j$ in contrast to the classic Dominating Set problem which is NP-hard in split graphs. This result motivates us to investigate the effect of restriction $j$ on the complexity of $[1,j]$-domination problem on various classes of graphs. Although for $j\geq 3$, it has been proved that the minimum of classical domination is equal to minimum $[1,j]$-domination in interval graphs, the complexity of finding the minimum $[1,2]$-domination in interval graphs is still outstanding. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum $[1,2]$ on non-proper interval graphs by a dynamic programming technique. Next, on the negative side, we show that the minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set problem on circle graphs is $NP$-complete.</description>

      <title>A Formal Proof of R(4,5)=25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1995, McKay and Radziszowski proved that the Ramsey number R(4,5) is equal to 25. Their proof relies on a combination of high-level arguments and computational steps. The authors have performed the computational parts of the proof with different implementations in order to reduce the possibility of an error in their programs. In this work, we prove this theorem in the interactive theorem prover HOL4 limiting the uncertainty to the small HOL4 kernel. Instead of verifying their algorithms directly, we rely on the HOL4 interface to MiniSat SAT to prove gluing lemmas. To reduce the number of such lemmas and thus make the computational part of the proof feasible, we implement a generalization algorithm. We verify that its output covers all the possible cases by implementing a custom SAT-solver extended with a graph isomorphism checker.</description>
