      <title>GX 301-2 pre-periastron and apastron flares with MAXI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bright high-mass X-ray binary GX 301-2 exhibits two periodic flare episodes along its orbit which are produced when the neutron star is close to the apastron and periastron passages. Time-resolved spectra were extracted and several models applied to describe all of them. The best description was obtained with a blackbody continuum modified by the Fe K-shell absorption edge, absorbed by a large column density on the order of 10^23 cm^-2 and, if present, a Fe Kalpha fluorescent emission line. Three of the nine apastron flares were as bright as the pre-periastron flare and two of them coincided with spin-up episodes of the neutron star. This fact points to the presence of a transient disc around the neutron star as it passes through the apastron that increases the accretion process. The size of emitting region on the neutron star surface showed some variability but quite consistent with a hot spot.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts with Narrow Beaming Angles Can Escape from Magnetar Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond duration transients observed in the radio band, with their origin and radiation mechanism remaining unclear to date. Growing evidence indicates that at least some FRBs originate from magnetars and are likely generated within the magnetospheres of these highly magnetized neutron stars. However, a recent study suggested that FRBs originating from magnetar magnetospheres would be scattered by magnetospheric electron--positron pair plasma, making it impossible for them to escape successfully. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the scattering effect can be greatly attenuated if the angle between the FRB propagation direction and the background magnetic field is $\sim10^{-2} \text{ rad}$ or smaller. When the angle is around $10^{-1} \text{ rad}$, the beaming effect of FRBs becomes significant in reducing scattering. Such FRBs have small transverse spatial sizes, which can help them instantly push the front plasma laterally out of the radiation region. This significantly mitigates the FRB-induced two-photon annihilation reaction, $\gamma+\gamma\to e^{-}+e^{+}$, which was previously regarded as a key factor hindering the propagation of FRBs. A critical radiation cone half-opening angle between $10^{-3}-10^{-2}\text{ rad}$ is found for an FRB with isotropic luminosity $L_{\text{iso}}\sim 10^{42}\text{ erg s}^{-1}$ and emitted at a radius $r_{\text{em}}\lesssim 10^9\text{ cm}$ in the magnetosphere of a magnetar. Smaller beaming angles and larger emission radii can be more advantageous for the propagation of FRBs in magnetospheres. Our result supports the scenario that FRBs could originate from magnetar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ly$\alpha$ radiation force on super-Eddington accretion onto a massive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viability of super-Eddington accretion remains a topic of intense debate, crucial for understanding the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe. However, the impact of Ly$\alpha$ radiation force on this issue remains poorly understood. We investigate the propagation of the Ly$\alpha$ photons and evaluate the Ly$\alpha$ radiation force within a spherically symmetric accreting HI gas onto the central black hole. We solve the radiation transfer equation, incorporating the destruction processes of Ly$\alpha$ photons through two-photon decay and collisional de-excitation. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ photons, originating in the HII region around black holes, suffer from multiple resonance scattering before being destroyed via two-photon decay and collisional de-excitation. Hence, the Ly$\alpha$ radiation force undergoes a significant amplification, surpassing gravity at the innermost section of the HI region. This amplification, quantified as the force multiplier, reaches approximately 130 and remains nearly constant, regardless of the optical depth at the line center, provided the optical thickness of the flow is within the range of $10^{10-14}$. The requisite lower limit of the product of gas density and black hole mass to realize the super-Eddington accretion is found to be in the range $(2-{40}) \times 10^9 M_\odot\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, which is a few to tens of times larger than the minimum value obtained without accounting for the Ly$\alpha$ radiation force. The pronounced amplification of the Ly$\alpha$ radiation force poses a substantial challenge to the feasibility of super-Eddington accretion.</description>

      <title>LHAASO detection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission surrounding PSR J0248+6021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of an extended very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray source coincident with the locations of middle-aged (62.4~\rm kyr) pulsar PSR J0248+6021, by using the LHAASO-WCDA data of live 796 days and LHAASO-KM2A data of live 1216 days. A significant excess of \gray induced showers is observed both by WCDA in energy bands of 1-25~\rm TeV and KM2A in energy bands of $&gt;$ 25~\rm TeV with 7.3 $\sigma$ and 13.5 $\sigma$, respectively. The best-fit position derived through WCDA data is R.A. = 42.06$^\circ \pm$ 0.12$^\circ$ and Dec. = 60.24$^\circ \pm $ 0.13$^\circ$ with an extension of 0.69$^\circ\pm$0.15$^\circ$ and that of the KM2A data is R.A.= 42.29$^\circ \pm $ 0.13$^\circ$ and Dec. = 60.38$^\circ \pm$ 0.07$^\circ$ with an extension of 0.37$^\circ\pm$0.07$^\circ$. No clear extended multiwavelength counterpart of this LHAASO source has been found from the radio band to the GeV band. The most plausible explanation of the VHE \gray emission is the inverse Compton process of highly relativistic electrons and positrons injected by the pulsar. These electrons/positrons are hypothesized to be either confined within the pulsar wind nebula or to have already escaped into the interstellar medium, forming a pulsar halo.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of negative and positive spectral lags in GRB prompt phase due to shear Comptonization from a structured jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive spectral lags are commonly observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt phase where soft photons lag behind hard ones in their spectral studies. Opposite to this pattern, a fraction of GRBs show a negative spectral lag where hard photons arrive later compared to soft photons. Similarly, recent Fermi-LAT observations show a late onset of high-energy photons in most GRB observations. A fraction of GRBs show a transition from positive to negative lags. Such negative lags and the spectral lag transition have no convincing explanation. We show that a structured GRB jet with velocity shear naturally produces both positive and negative spectral lags. s gain energy from repeated scattering with shearing layers and subsequently escape from higher altitudes. Hence, these photons are delayed compared to soft photons producing a negative spectral lag. The inner jet has no shear and a positive lag appears providing a unified picture of spectral lags in GRBs. The theory predicts a flip in spectral lag from positive to negative within the evolution of the prompt phase. Comparison of the observed lags with the prediction of the theory limits the possible range of GRB jet Lorentz factors to be a few tens.</description>

      <title>TRAPUM pulsar and transient search in the Sextans A and B galaxies and discovery of background FRB 20210924D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Small and Large Magellanic Clouds are the only galaxies outside our own in which radio pulsars have been discovered to date. The sensitivity of the MeerKAT radio interferometer offers an opportunity to search for a population of more distant extragalactic pulsars. The TRAPUM (TRansients And PUlsars with MeerKAT) collaboration has performed a radio-domain search for pulsars and transients in the dwarf star-forming galaxies Sextans A and B, situated at the edge of the local group 1.4 Mpc away. We conducted three 2-hour multi-beam observations at L-band (856-1712 MHz) with the full array of MeerKAT. No pulsars were found down to a radio pseudo-luminosity upper limit of 7.9$\pm$0.4 Jy kpc$^{2}$ at 1400 MHz, which is 28 times more sensitive than the previous limit from the Murriyang telescope. This luminosity is 30 per cent greater than that of the brightest known radio pulsar and sets a cut-off on the luminosity distributions of the entire Sextans A and B galaxies for unobscured radio pulsars beamed in our direction. A Fast Radio Burst was detected in one of the Sextans A observations at a Dispersion Measure (DM) of 737 pc cm$^{-3}$. We believe this is a background event not associated with the dwarf galaxy due to its large DM and its S/N being strongest in the wide-field incoherent beam of MeerKAT.</description>

      <title>Origin of TeV Emission in GRB 221009A: Co-effort of the External Reverse and Forward Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TeV emission detected in just five gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is generally ascribed to the synchrotron emission or the synchrotron self-Compton process in the external forward shock. The brightest gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, with an unprecedented detected high energy flux of TeV emission, poses a serious challenge to the above scenario. Different from previous works, we involve the long bursting behavior of GRB~221009A in modeling its external-shocks. The TeV emission together with the later multi-band afterglows of GRB 221009A are all successfully reproduced. It is firstly found that the TeV emission in the early phase is mainly from the co-effort of the external reverse and forward shocks, i.e., the inverse-Compton scattering of the synchrotron emission from the external reverse-shock by the electrons in the external forward-shock. This is owing to that the long bursting behavior leads to a long lasting of energy injection into the external shock and the corresponding reverse-shock. In the later phase, the TeV emission is dominated by the synchrotron self-Compton process in the external forward-shock, which is consistent with previous scenario. Our results indicate the vital role of the external reverse-shock in shaping the early TeV emission of GRBs.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic and secular variations in the spin frequency $\nu$ of a rotation-powered pulsar complicate the interpretation of the measured braking index, $n$, in terms of a power-law spin-down torque $\propto \nu^{n_{\rm pl}}$. Both categories of variation can lead to anomalous braking indices, with $\vert n \vert = \vert \nu \ddot{\nu} / \dot{\nu}^2 \vert \gg 1$, where the overdot symbolizes a derivative with respect to time. Here we quantify the combined effect of stochastic and secular deviations from pure power-law spin down on measurements of $n$. Through analytic calculations, Monte Carlo simulations involving synthetic data, and modern Bayesian timing techniques, it is shown that the variance of $n$ satisfies the predictive, falsifiable formula $\langle n^{2} \rangle = (n_{\rm pl}+\dot{K}_{\rm dim})^{2}+\sigma_{\rm dim}^{2}$, where $\dot{K}_{\rm dim}$ is inversely proportional to the time-scale $\tau_K$ over which the proportionality constant of the power-law spin-down torque varies, $\sigma_{\rm dim}$ is proportional to the timing noise amplitude and inversely proportional to the square root of the total observing time, and the average is over an ensemble of random realizations of the timing noise process. The anomalous regime $\langle n^2 \rangle \gg 1$ occurs for $\dot{K}_{\rm dim} \gg 1$, $\sigma_{\rm dim} \gg 1$, or both. The sign of $n$ depends in part on the sign of $\dot{K}_{\rm dim}$, so it is possible to measure unequal numbers of positive and negative $n$ values in a large sample of pulsars. The distinguishable impact of stochastic and secular anomalies on phase residuals is quantified to prepare for extending the analysis of synthetic data to real pulsars.</description>

      <title>Red quasars: estimation of SMBH spin, mass and accretion disk inclination angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimated values of spin, mass and inclination angle for sample of 42 red quasars. Our estimations show that 2 objects: F2MS~J1113+1244 and F2MS~J1434+0935 with highest Eddington ratios may have geometrically thick disk. Six objects: SDSS~J0036-0113, S82X~0040+0058, S82X~0118+0018, S82X~0303-0115, FBQS~J1227+3214, S82X~2328-0028 may have "retrograde" rotation. Analysis of estimated spin values shows that red quasar population may contain Seyfert galaxies and NLS1.</description>

      <title>Long-Time 2D Simulations of Fallback Supernovae: A Systematic Investigation of Explosions Dynamics and Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of eight fallback simulations of zero-metallicity progenitors with masses between $60 M_\odot$ and $95 M_\odot$. The simulations are computed in 2D with the general relativistic CoCoNuT-FMT code for the first few seconds after black hole formation, and then mapped to the Newtonian code Prometheus for long-duration simulations beyond shock breakout. All simulations produce successful explosions with final energies ranging from $0.41 \times 10^{51}$ erg to $2.5 \times 10^{51}$ erg and black hole masses from $20.7 M_\odot$ to $34.4 M_\odot$. Explosion energies and remnant masses do not vary monotonically with progenitor mass, but the mass cuts cluster near the outer edge of the helium core. A supplementary model with decreased neutrino heating provides a tentative indication that successful explosions require the shock to reach the sonic point in the infall profile by the time of black hole formation. The propagation of the shock to the surface is only approximately captured by proposed shock invariants, but these may still be sufficient to extrapolate the final black hole mass from the first seconds of evolution. We also discuss potential multi-messenger signatures of the predicted fallback explosions. The enrichment of the ejecta in intermediate mass and iron-group elements varies considerably and is non-neligible for the more powerful explosions. Low-level neutrino emission after black hole formation from these very massive progenitors may be detectable in the case of a Galactic event.</description>

      <title>Changing-Look Inspirals: Trends and Switches in AGN Disk Emission as Signposts for Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using grid-based hydrodynamics simulations and analytic modeling, we compute the electromagnetic (EM) signatures of gravitational wave (GW) driven inspirals of massive black hole binaries that accrete gas from circumbinary disks, exploring the effects of varying gas temperatures, viscosity laws, and binary mass ratios. Our main finding is that active galactic nuclei (AGN's) that host inspiraling binaries can exhibit two sub-types of long-term secular variability patterns: Type-A events which dim before merger and brighten afterward, and Type-B events which brighten before merger and dim afterward. In both types the merger coincides with a long-lasting chromatic change of the AGN appearance. The sub-types correspond to the direction of angular momentum transfer between the binary and the disk, and could thus have correlated GW signatures if the gas-induced torque can be inferred from GW phase drift measurements by LISA. The long-term brightness trends are caused by steady weakening of the disk-binary torque that accompanies orbital decay, it induces a hysteresis effect whereby the disk "remembers" the history of the binary's contraction. We illustrate the effect using a reduced model problem of an axisymmetric thin disk subjected at its inner edge to the weakening torque of an inspiraling binary. The model problem yields a new class of self-similar disk solutions, which capture salient features of the multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. We use these solutions to derive variable AGN disk emission signatures within years to decades of massive black hole binary mergers in AGN's. Spectral changes of Mrk 1018 might have been triggered by an inspiral-merger event.</description>

      <title>A systematic study of Millihertz Quasi-periodic Oscillations in GS 1826-238</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a systematic investigation of millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) in the low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826$-$238 observed with NICER and Insight-HXMT. We discovered 35 time intervals exhibiting mHz QPOs out of 106 GTI samples in the frequency range of 4.2-12.8 mHz at a significance level of $&gt;5\sigma$. The source remains in a soft state in our study. No significant differences are found between the samples with and without mHz QPOs according to positions in the color-color and hardness-intensity diagrams. These QPOs were discovered at an accretion rate of $\sim 0.1 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, similar to other sources. The broadband spectrum of GS 1826$-$238 can be modeled as a combination of a multi-color blackbody from the accretion disk and a Comptonization with seed photons emitted from the NS surface. The flux modulations of mHz QPOs are related to variations of the temperature of Comptonization seed photons, consistent with the marginally stable burning theory.</description>

      <title>Theory of photon scattering in shearing plasma: Applications to GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a new mechanism for photon energy gain in a relativistic plasma with velocity shear. This process takes place in optically thick plasma and resembles conventional Fermi acceleration, where photons undergo multiple scatterings between regions with varying Lorentz factors, leading to an overall energy increase. The resulting high-energy spectra from the escaped photons exhibit a power-law form. The mechanism is an alternative to the classical radiation spectrum from power-law accelerated particles, which can produce power-law spectra in sources like Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). By employing both numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we calculate the expected spectra for GRBs, and show that they match the observed photon indices ($\beta$) at high energies.</description>

      <title>Radiation Transport Simulations of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions from Star-Disk Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic collisions between a star on an inclined orbit around a supermassive black hole and its accretion disk offers a promising explanation for X-ray "quasi-periodic eruptions" (QPEs). Each passage through the disk shocks and compresses gas ahead of the star, which subsequently re-expands above the disk as a quasi-spherical cloud. We present spherically symmetric Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations which follow the production of photons behind the radiation-mediated shock, Comptonization by hot electrons, and the eventual escape of the radiation through the expanding debris. Such one-dimension calculations are approximately justified for thin disks, through which the star of radius $R_{\star}$ passes faster than the shocked gas can flow around the star. For collision speeds $v_{\rm coll} \gtrsim 0.15 c$ and disk surface densities $\Sigma \sim 10^{3}$ g cm$^{-2}$ characteristic of those encountered by stellar orbits consistent with QPE recurrence times, the predicted transient light curves exhibit peak luminosities $\gtrsim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and Comptonized quasi-thermal (Wien-like) spectra which peak at energies $h\nu \sim 100$ eV, broadly consistent with QPE properties. For these conditions, gas and radiation are out of equilibrium and the emission temperature is harder than the blackbody value due to inefficient photon production behind the shock. Alternatively, for higher disk densities and/or lower shock velocities, QPE emission could instead represent the comparatively brief phase shortly after shock break-out, though in this case the bulk of the radiation is thermalized and occurs in the ultraviolet instead of the X-ray band. In either scenario, reproducing the observed eruption properties (duration, luminosity, temperature) requires a large radius $R_{\star} \gtrsim 10R_{\odot}$, which may point to inflation of the star's atmosphere from repeated collisions.</description>

      <title>Suppressed accretion onto massive black hole binaries surrounded by thin disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that gas disks around binary systems might deliver gas to the binary components only when the circumbinary disk is relatively warm. We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally ``stop accreting'' if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes, and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary-disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary; which in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such non-accreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts, but could exhibit dramatic re-brightening after the black holes in-spiral and merge. This dimming occurs at high photon energies, corresponding to the effective truncation of the circumbinary disk. As a result, such system may be underluminous in UV bands and missing X-ray emission entirely, potentially resembling the spectra of `Little Red Dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Resonance Locking of Anharmonic $g$-Modes in Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars in coalescing binaries deform due to the tidal gravitational fields generated by their companions. During the inspiral phase, the tidal deformation is dominated by the fundamental oscillation~($f$-) mode of the stars. The tide also has sub-dominant gravity~($g$-) modes that are resonantly excited when the linear tidal forcing sweeps through their eigenfrequencies. Beyond the linear order in perturbed fluid displacement, the $g$-modes are anharmonic, i.e., their oscillation frequencies depend on the mode energy. For the lowest-order $g$-mode, we show that when the tidal forcing reaches its linear eigenfrequency, the mode starts to dynamically adjust its energy so that its nonlinearly shifted oscillation frequency always matches that of the driving field. This phenomenon, which we term `resonance locking', persists through the rest of the inspiral, and hence, the mode grows to substantially larger energies than in the linear theory. Using a $1.4$--$1.4\, M_{\odot}$ binary neutron star system with the SLy4 equation of state, we find this results in an extra correction to the frequency-domain gravitational wave (GW) phase of $|\Delta \Psi|\approx 3\,{\rm rad}$ accumulated from the onset of resonance locking at the GW frequency of $94\,{\rm Hz}$ to the merger at $1.05\,{\rm kHz}$. This effect probes details of the internal structure of merging neutron stars beyond their bulk properties such as tidal deformability.</description>

Abstract: The Time-Domain And MultiMessenger (TDAMM) Communications Science Analysis Group (TDAMMCommSAG) was formulated to describe the unique technical challenges of communicating rapidly to and from NASA astrophysics missions studying the most variable, transient, and extreme objects in the Universe. This report describes the study of if and how the transition from current NASA-operated space and ground relays to commercial services will adequately serve these missions. Depending on the individual mission requirements and Concept of Operations (ConOps), TDAMM missions may utilize a rapid low-rate demand access service, a low-rate continuous contact service, low-latency downlink upon demand, or a higher-latency but regular relay service. The specific implementations can vary via space relay or direct to Earth, but requires flexibility and adaptability using modern software infrastructure. The study team reviewed the current state of NASA communications services and future commercial and NASA communications services under study and in development. We explored the communications capabilities driving from the behavior of the astrophysical objects themselves.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hubble constant using localized and unlocalized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hubble constant ($H_0$) is one of the most important parameters in the standard $\rm \Lambda CDM$ model. The measurements given by two major methods show a gap greater than $4\sigma$, also known as Hubble tension. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic events with millisecond duration, which can be used as cosmological probes with high accuracy. In this paper, we constrain the Hubble constant using localized and unlocalized FRBs. The probability distributions of DM$_{\rm host}$ and DM$_{\rm IGM}$ from IllustrisTNG simulation are used. 69 localized FRBs give the constraint of $H_0=70.41_{-2.34}^{+2.28}$ km/s/Mpc, which lies between early-time and late-time values, thus highlighting its individuality as a cosmological probe. We also use Monte Carlo simulation and direct sampling to calculate the pseudo redshift distribution of 527 unlocalized FRBs from CHIME observation. The median values and fixed scattered pseudo redshifts are both used to constrain Hubble constant. The corresponding constraints of $H_{0}$ from unlocalized bursts are $69.89_{-0.67}^{+0.66}$ km/s/Mpc and $68.81_{-0.68}^{+0.68}$ km/s/Mpc respectively. This result also indicates that the uncertainty of Hubble constant constraint will drop to $\sim1\%$ if the number of localized FRBs is raised to $\sim500$. Above uncertainties only include the statistical error. The systematic errors are also discussed, and play the dominant role for the current sample.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a newly constructed black hole coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper finds an exact singular black hole solution in the presence of nonlinear electrodynamics as the source of matter field surrounded by a cloud of strings in $4D$ $AdS$ spacetime. Here, the presence of the cloud of string, the usual Bardeen solution, becomes singular. The obtained black hole solution interpolates with the $AdS$ Letelier black hole in the absence of both the deviation parameter and magnetic charge and interpolates with the $AdS$ Bardeen black hole in the absence of the deviation parameter and a cloud of strings parameter. We analyse the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, including the stability of the resulting black hole, numerically and graphically. Thermodynamical quantities associated with the black hole get modified due to the nonlinear electrodynamics and cloud of strings. Moreover, we study the effect of a cloud of strings parameter, magnetic charge and deviation parameter on critical points and phase transition of the obtained black hole where the cosmological constant is treated as the thermodynamics pressure. The critical radius increases with increasing deviation parameter values and magnetic charge values. In contrast, the critical pressure and temperature decrease with increasing deviation parameters and magnetic charge values.</description>

      <title>Effect of $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity on the properties of strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate strange quark stars within the framework of modified $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar and $T$ denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, specifically defined as $ f(R,T) = R + 2\chi T $. The equation of state is obtained with the different forms of the MIT bag model and quark mass model with medium effects and self-consistent thermodynamical treatment. We find that negative values of $\chi$ significantly increase both the mass and radius of the quark star. The inclusion of $\chi$ helps to satisfy recent the astrophysical constraints on the mass-radius relationship. We have also constrained the values of $\chi$ for each EoS, based on the observed maximum mass and corresponding radius, demonstrating that the inclusion of this parameter helps to address the challenges posed by both the GW190814 event and NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451. We also observe that the inclusion of $f(R,T)$ gravity leads to an increase in both the maximum mass, by about $ (0.23- 0.27)~M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding radius, by approximately (1.5-2.0)~\text{km}, depending on the chosen equation of state.</description>

Abstract: Massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars comprise a spectroscopic class characterized by high temperatures (Teff &gt; ~30 kK) and powerful and rapid stellar winds. Hydrogen-rich WR stars represent the most massive stars in existence (M &gt; ~100 Msun), while classical WR stars are hydrogen-depleted, evolved massive stars which probe the final evolutionary stages of massive stars prior to core collapse. They dominate entire stellar populations in terms of radiative and mechanical feedback, and are thought to give rise to powerful transients such as hydrogen-stripped supernovae (type Ibc SNe) and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). In this chapter, we summarize the main observed properties of WR populations in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies, and discuss open problems in our understanding of their structure and formation</description>

      <title>Formation of Giant Radio Sources in Galaxy Clusters</title>

Abstract: The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing debates.We utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments.To avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). We find the 'lower power-larger bubble' effect: lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.</description>

      <title>Do Finite Density Effects Jeopardize Axion Nucleophobia in Supernovae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleophobic axion models, wherein axion couplings to both protons and neutrons are simultaneously suppressed, can relax the stringent constraints from SN 1987A. However, it remains uncertain whether these models maintain their nucleophobic property under the influence of finite baryon density effects. These are especially relevant in astrophysical environments near saturation density, such as Supernovae (SNe). In this study, we demonstrate that the nucleophobic solution remains viable also at finite density. Furthermore, we show that the SN axion bound relaxes significantly in nucleophobic models, even when accounting for the integration over the non-homogeneous environment of the SN core.</description>

      <title>Dark matter interpretation of GRB 221009A: a singlet scalar explains LHAASO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we find a new signal of dark matter (DM) through an intensive gamma ray burst (GRB), called GRB 221009A. This indirect detection approach devotes to the decay of DM particles into high energy (HE) photons. In this context, a singlet scalar DM generated at the redshift of the GRB is up-scattered by the high energy cosmic rays (HECRs) during its propagation to Earth. This highly boosted DM then possesses a high flux and undergoes a dominant di-photon decay before reaching the detector. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) probes such energetic gamma rays whereby has recorded a 18 TeV event for the aforementioned GRB.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole energy extraction, irreducible mass feedback, and the effect of captured particles charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the extraction of the rotational energy of a Kerr black hole (BH) endowed with a test charge and surrounded by an external test magnetic field and ionized low-density matter. For a magnetic field parallel to the BH spin, electrons move outward (inward) and protons inward (outward) in a region around the BH poles (equator). For zero charge, the polar region comprises spherical polar angles $-60^\circ\lesssim \theta \lesssim 60^\circ$ and the equatorial region $60^\circ\lesssim \theta \lesssim 120^\circ$. The polar region shrinks for positive charge, and the equatorial region enlarges. For an isotropic particle density, we argue the BH could experience a cyclic behavior: starting from a zero charge, it accretes more polar protons than equatorial electrons, gaining net positive charge, energy, and angular momentum. Then, the shrinking(enlarging) of the polar(equatorial) region makes it accrete more equatorial electrons than polar protons, gaining net negative charge, energy, and angular momentum. In this phase, the BH rotational energy is extracted. The extraction process continues until the new enlargement of the polar region reverses the situation, and the cycle repeats. We show that this electrodynamical process produces a relatively limited increase of the BH irreducible mass compared to gravitational mechanisms like the Penrose process, hence being a more efficient and promising mechanism for extracting the BH rotational energy.</description>

      <title>How the HESS J1731-347 event could be explained using $\bf{K^{-}}$ condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of a compact star with a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, located within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, has substantially reinforced the evidence for the presence of exotic matter in neutron stars core. This finding has markedly enhanced our comprehension of the equation of state for dense nuclear matter. In the present work, we investigate the possible existence of a kaon condensation in hadronic neutron stars by employing and comparing two theoretical frameworks: the Relativistic Mean Field model with first order kaon condensate and the Momentum-Dependent Interaction model complemented by chiral effective theory. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the specific event with the inclusion of a kaon condensation in dense nuclear matter. The application of two different models enriches the research, providing insights from the aspect of different theoretical frameworks that accurately predict the existence of HESS J1731-347. In both cases significant insights are extracted for the parameter space of both models, emphasizing to those concerning the nucleon-kaon potential, the threshold density for the appearance of a kaon condensation, as well as the parameter $a_{3}m_{s}$ which is related to the strangeness content of the proton. Concluding, the present research indicates that a more systematic investigation of similar events could offer valuable constraints on the properties of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Multi-Observatory Research of Young Stellar Energetic Flares (MORYSEF): X-ray Flare Related Phenomena and Multi-epoch Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most powerful stellar flares driven by magnetic energy occur during the early pre-main sequence (PMS) phase. The Orion Nebula represents the nearest region populated by young stars, showing the greatest number of flares accessible to a single pointing of Chandra. This study is part of a multi-observatory project to explore stellar surface magnetic fields (with HET-HPF), particle ejections (VLBA), and disk ionization (ALMA) immediately following the detection of PMS super-flares with Chandra. In December 2023, we successfully conducted such a multi-telescope campaign. Additionally, by analyzing Chandra data from 2003, 2012, and 2016, we examine the multi-epoch behavior of PMS X-ray emission related to PMS magnetic cyclic activity and ubiquitous versus sample-confined mega-flaring. Our findings follow. 1) We report detailed stellar quiescent and flare X-ray properties for numerous HET/ALMA/VLBA targets, facilitating ongoing multi-wavelength analyses. 2) For numerous moderately energetic flares, we report correlations (or lack thereof) between flare energies and stellar mass/size (presence/absence of disks) for the first time. The former is attributed to the correlation between convection-driven dynamo and stellar volume, while the latter suggests the operation of solar-type flare mechanisms in PMS stars. 3) We find that most PMS stars exhibit minor long-term baseline variations, indicating the absence of intrinsic magnetic dynamo cycles or observational mitigation of cycles by saturated PMS X-rays. 4) We conclude that X-ray mega-flares are ubiquitous phenomena in PMS stars, which suggests that all protoplanetary disks and nascent planets are subject to violent high-energy emission and particle irradiation events.</description>

Abstract: Tornadoes are severe weather phenomena characterized by a violently rotating column of air connecting the ground to a parent storm. Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.</description>

      <title>Large-scale cosmic ray anisotropies with 19 years of data from the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results are presented for the measurement of large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory during 19 years of operation, prior to AugerPrime, the upgrade of the Observatory. The 3D dipole amplitude and direction are reconstructed above $4\,$EeV in four energy bins. Besides the established dipolar anisotropy in right ascension above $8\,$EeV, the Fourier amplitude of the $8$ to $16\,$EeV energy bin is now also above the $5\sigma$ discovery level. No time variation of the dipole moment above $8\,$EeV is found, setting an upper limit to the rate of change of such variations of $0.3\%$ per year at the $95\%$ confidence level. Additionally, the results for the angular power spectrum are shown, demonstrating no other statistically significant multipoles. The results for the equatorial dipole component down to $0.03\,$EeV are presented, using for the first time a data set obtained with a trigger that has been optimized for lower energies. Finally, model predictions are discussed and compared with observations, based on two source emission scenarios obtained in the combined fit of spectrum and composition above $0.6\,$EeV.</description>

      <title>H-AMR FORGE'd in FIRE I: Magnetic state transitions, jet launching and radiative emission in super-Eddington, highly magnetized quasar disks formed from cosmological initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasars are powered by supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disks, yet standard disk models are inconsistent with many quasar observations. Recently, Hopkins et al. (2024) simulated the formation of a quasar disk feeding a SMBH of mass $M=1.3\times10^7\,M_\odot$ in a host galaxy that evolved from cosmological initial conditions. The disk had surprisingly strong toroidal magnetic fields that supported it vertically from gravity and powered fast accretion. What radiation and feedback can such a system produce? To answer this, we must follow the gas to the event horizon. For this, we interpolated the accretion system onto the grid of the general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics code H-AMR and performed 3D simulations with BH spins $a=0$ and $a=0.9375$. This remapping generates spurious magnetic monopoles, which we erase using a novel divergence cleaning approach. Despite the toroidal magnetic field's dominance at large radii, vertical magnetic flux builds up at the event horizon. This causes a magnetic state transition within the inner $200$ gravitational radii of the disk, where net vertical magnetic flux begins dominating the accretion flow. This powers strong winds and, if the BH spins, relativistic jets that can spin-down the BH within $5-10\,{\rm Myrs}$. Sometimes, vertical magnetic fields of opposite sign reach the BH, causing polarity inversion events that briefly destroy the jets and, possibly, the X-ray corona. The disk powers accretion at rates $5\times$ the Eddington limit, which can double the BH mass in $5-10\,{\rm Myrs}$. When $a=0.9375$ ($a=0$), the energy in outflows and radiation equals about $60\%$ ($10\%$) and $100\%$ ($3\%$) of the accreted rest mass energy, respectively. Much of the light escapes in cool, extended $\gtrsim1300\,{\rm au}$ photospheres, consistent with quasar microlensing and the ``big blue bump'' seen in spectral energy distributions.</description>

Abstract: In general relativity, the gravitational field of an electrically charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body is described by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) metric. Depending on the charge to mass ratio, the solution describes a black hole or a naked singularity. In the naked-singularity regime, a general property of this metric is the existence of a radius, known as the zero-gravity radius, where a test particle would remain at rest. As a consequence of repulsive gravity there is no circular orbit inside this radius, and at least a part of any quasi-stable structure must necessarily lie outside of it. Assuming the iconic torus in the compact source Sgr A* at the Galactic center observed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to be the image of a quasi-stationary fluid structure, we provide rigorous constraints in the RN metric on the electric charge-to-mass ratio Q/M of Sgr A*. A comparison between the EHT observations and the space-time zero-gravity radius provides the most conservative limit on the charge of Sgr A* to be |Q/M| &lt; 2.32 in geometrized units. A charged naked singularity respecting this charge-to-mass constraint is consistent with the current EHT observations, if the image is not interpreted as a photon ring.</description>

      <title>Searching for topological dark matter in LIGO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave interferometers have been recently proposed as a promising probe in searches for dark matter. These highly sensitive instruments are potentially able to detect the interactions of dark matter with the detector's hardware. In this work, we explore the possibilities of discovering topological dark matter with the LIGO detectors. We analyze domain walls consisting of dark matter passing through the Earth, leaving traces in multiple detectors simultaneously. Considering dark matter interactions with light in the interferometer, and with the beam splitter, we perform the first analysis of topological dark matter with gravitational-wave strain data. We examine whether astrophysically unexpected triggers could be explained by domain-wall passages. We find that all of the binary black hole mergers we analyze favor the binary black hole merger hypothesis rather than the domain-wall hypothesis, with the closest being GW190521. Moreover, we find that some topological dark matter signals can be caught by binary black hole searches. Finally, we find that special types of glitches in the measurement data can inevitably limit the dark matter searches for certain parameters. These results are expected to guide future searches and analyses.</description>

      <title>A gating-and-inpainting perspective on GW150914 ringdown overtone: understanding the data analysis systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the recent debate on the evidence for an overtone in the black hole ringdown of GW150914 using an independent data-analysis pipeline. By gating and inpainting the data, we discard the contamination from earlier parts of the gravitational wave signal before ringdown. This enables parameter estimation to be conducted in the frequency domain, which is mathematically equivalent to the time domain method. We keep the settings as similar as possible to the previous studies by Cotesta et al. arXiv:2201.00822 and Isi et al. arXiv:1905.00869 arXiv:2202.02941 which yielded conflicting results on the Bayes factor of the overtone. Our aim is to understand how different data analysis systematics, including sampling rates, erroneous timestamps, the frequency resolution of the noise power spectrum, and the parameterization of ringdown amplitudes, would influence the statistical significance of an overtone. Our main results indicate the following: (i) a low-resolution estimation of the noise power spectrum tends to diminish the significance of overtones, (ii) adjusting the start time to a later digitized point reduces the significance of overtones, and (iii) overtone evidence varies with different sampling rates if the start time is too early, indicating that the overtone is a poor model, hence we propose a convergence test to verify the validity of an overtone model. With these issues addressed, we find the Bayes factors for the overtone to range from $10$ to $26$ in a range of times centered at the best-fit merger time of GW150914, which supports the existence of an overtone in agreement with the conclusions of Isi et al. arXiv:1905.00869 arXiv:2202.02941.</description>

      <title>Detecting Axion Dark Matter with Black Hole Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The axion, as a leading dark matter candidate, is the target of many ongoing and proposed experimental searches based on its coupling to photons. Ultralight axions that couple to photons can also cause polarization rotation of light, which the cosmic microwave background can probe. In this work, we show that a large axion field is inevitably developed around supermassive black holes due to the Bose-Einstein condensation of axions, enhancing the induced birefringence effects. Therefore, measuring the modulations of supermassive black hole imaging polarization angles is a strong probe of the axion-photon coupling due to the formation of the axion condensation (axion star) which enhances the axion field. The oscillating axion field around black holes induces polarization rotation on the black hole image, which is detectable and distinguishable from astrophysical effects on the polarization angle, as it exhibits distinctive temporal variability and frequency invariability. In this work, we perform theoretical calculations of the axion star formation rate and the corresponding enhanced axion field value near supermassive black holes. Then, we present the range of axion-photon couplings within the axion mass range $10^{-21}-10^{-16}\,\text{eV}$ that can be probed by the Event Horizon Telescope. The axion parameter space probed by black hole polarimetry will expand with improvements in sensitivity of polarization measurements and more black hole polarimetry targets with determined black hole masses.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter on $f$-mode oscillations of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of dark matter (DM) on $f$-mode oscillations in DM admixed neutron stars (NSs) is investigated in a comprehensive analysis with particular attention to the role of the nuclear equation of state. Hadronic matter is modeled by the relativistic mean field model and the DM model is based on the neutron decay anomaly. The non-radial $f$-mode oscillations for such DM admixed NS are studied in a full general relativistic framework. We investigate the impact of DM, DM self-interaction, and DM fraction on the $f$-mode characteristics. We derive relations encoding the effect of DM on $f$-mode parameters. We then perform a systematic study by varying all the model parameters within their known uncertainty range and obtain a universal relation for the DM fraction based on the total mass of the star and DM self-interaction strength. We also perform a correlation study among model parameters, NS observables, in particular, $f$-mode parameters. Finally, we check the $f$-mode universal relations (URs) for the case of DM admixed NSs and demonstrate the existence of a degeneracy between purely hadronic NSs and DM admixed NSs.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Correlations and Urca Process in Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of high-momentum correlated neutron-proton pairs
  at JLab suggest that the dense nucleonic component of the compact
  stars contains a fraction of high-momentum neutron-proton pairs that
  is not accounted for in the familiar Fermi-liquid theory of the
  neutron-proton fluid mixture. We compute the rate of the Urca
  process in compact stars taking into account the non-Fermi liquid
  contributions to the proton's spectral widths induced by short-range
  correlations. The Urca rate differs strongly from the Fermi-liquid
  prediction at low temperatures, in particular, the high threshold on
  the proton fraction precluding the Urca process in neutron stars is
  replaced by a smooth increase with the proton fraction. This observation
  may have a profound impact on the theories of cooling of compact
  stars.</description>

      <title>Origin of LAMOST J1010+2358 Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signature from Pop III massive stars of $140$--$260\,{\rm M_\odot}$ that end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are expected to be seen in very metal-poor (VMP) stars of ${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$. Although thousands of VMP stars have been discovered, the identification of a VMP star with a PISN signature has been elusive. Recently, the VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be the first star with a clear PISN signature. A subsequent study showed that ejecta from low-mass core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can also fit the abundance pattern equally well and additional elements such as C and Al are required to differentiate the two sources. Follow-up observations of LAMOST J1010+2358 by two independent groups were able to detect both C and Al. Additionally, key odd elements such as Na and Sc were also detected whose abundances were found to be higher than the upper limits found in the original detection. We perform a detailed analysis of the newly observed abundance patterns by exploring various possible formation channels for VMP stars. We find that purely low-mass CCSN ejecta as well as the combination of CCSN and Type 1a SN ejecta can provide an excellent fit to the newly observed abundance pattern. Our results confirm earlier analysis that the newly observed abundance pattern is peculiar but has no signatures of PISN.</description>

      <title>Stable Case BB/BC Mass Transfer to Form GW190425-like Massive Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On April 25th, 2019, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration discovered a Gravitational-wave (GW) signal from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, i.e., GW190425. Due to the inferred large total mass, the origin of GW190425 remains unclear. We perform detailed stellar structure and binary evolution calculations that take into account mass-loss, internal differential rotation, and tidal interactions between a He-rich star and a NS companion. We explore the parameter space of the initial binary properties, including initial NS and He-rich masses and initial orbital period. We find that the immediate post-common-envelope progenitor system, consisting of a primary $\sim2.0\,M_\odot$ ($\sim1.7\,M_\odot$) NS and a secondary He-rich star with an initial mass of $\sim3.0-5.5\,M_\odot$ ($\sim5.5-6.0\,M_\odot$) in a close binary with an initial period of $\sim0.08-0.5\,{\rm{days}}$ ($\sim 0.08-0.4\,{\rm{days}}$), that experiences stable Case BB/BC mass transfer (MT) during binary evolution, can reproduce the formation of GW190425-like BNS events. Our studies reveal that the secondary He-rich star of the GW190425's progenitor before its core collapse can be efficiently spun up through tidal interaction, finally remaining as a NS with rotational energy even reaching $\sim10^{52}\,{\rm{erg}}$, which is always much higher than the neutrino-driven energy of the supernova (SN) explosion. If the newborn secondary NS is a magnetar, we expect that GW190425 can be the remnant of a magnetar-driven SN, e.g., a magnetar-driven ultra-stripped SN, a superluminous SN, or a broad-line Type Ic SN. Our results show that GW190425 could be formed through the isolated binary evolution, which involves a stable Case BB/BC MT just after the common envelope phase. On top of that, we show the He-rich star can be tidally spun up, potentially forming a spinning magnetized NS (magnetar) during the second SN explosion.</description>

      <title>Standardised formats and open-source analysis tools for the MAGIC telescopes data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruments for gamma-ray astronomy at Very High Energies ($E&gt;100\,{\rm GeV}$) have traditionally derived their scientific results through proprietary data and software. Data standardisation has become a prominent issue in this field both as a requirement for the dissemination of data from the next generation of gamma-ray observatories and as an effective solution to realise public data legacies of current-generation instruments. Specifications for a standardised gamma-ray data format have been proposed as a community effort and have already been successfully adopted by several instruments.
  We present the first production of standardised data from the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes. We converted $166\,{\rm h}$ of observations from different sources and validated their analysis with the open-source software Gammapy.
  We consider six data sets representing different scientific and technical analysis cases and compare the results obtained analysing the standardised data with open-source software against those produced with the MAGIC proprietary data and software. Aiming at a systematic production of MAGIC data in this standardised format, we also present the implementation of a database-driven pipeline automatically performing the MAGIC data reduction from the calibrated down to the standardised data level.
  In all the cases selected for the validation, we obtain results compatible with the MAGIC proprietary software, both for the manual and for the automatic data productions. Part of the validation data set is also made publicly available, thus representing the first large public release of MAGIC data.
  This effort and this first data release represent a technical milestone toward the realisation of a public MAGIC data legacy.</description>
