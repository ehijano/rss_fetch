      <title>The configurational entropy of random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graph theoretical approach to the configurational statistics of random tree-like objects, such as randomly branching polymers. In particular, we show that Pr\"ufer labelling provides: (i) direct access to the exact configurational entropy as a function of the tree composition, (ii) computable exact expressions for partition functions and important experimental observables for tree ensembles with controlled branching activity and (iii) an efficient sampling scheme for corresponding tree configurations and arbitrary static properties.</description>

      <title>Target search optimization by threshold resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic searchers as a key example uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Effect of an electromagnetic field on the barrier crossing rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum for the rate constant of an electric field-driven charged Brownian particle in the presence of a magnetic field (MF). For the cross fields with low or high values of the cyclotron frequency, an asymmetric splitting of the spectrum occurs with two peaks. Anharmonicity-induced additional splitting may appear around the lower resonating frequency at the intermediate strength of the applied MF. Another observation is that if the magnetic field is tilted from the z-direction, an additional peak appears between the two peaks. The position of the middle peak may be independent of the strength of the applied MF. In some cases, only one peak appears even in the presence of a magnetic field. We explain these observations considering the dynamics around the stable fixed point and determine the position of the peak in the spectrum for the rate constant as a function of the strength of the applied magnetic field. Thus the present study may find applications for tuning the conductivity of a solid electrolyte, which is very important in recent technology. Other applications may be in areas such as electromagnetic field-induced modulation of (a) thermally activated tunneling ionization, (b) thermally stimulated ionization, etc.</description>

      <title>The correspondence between the Adam-Gibbs and the Rosenfield relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive both the Adam-Gibbs and the Rosenfield relations from the microscopic point of view and compare them with the numerical calculation for one and two dimensional systems. The comparison shows there is an excellent agreement between theoretical and numerical calculations for their valid zones (in terms of the thermodynamic temperature) as suggested by experiments. It implies that there may be a transition temperature at which the two relations correspond to each other. We derive a relation to calculate it. Then, we generalize the Rosenfield relation for configurational thermodynamic entropy like quantity(TELQ) and time-dependent Shanon information entropy. At the same time, using a description with a fictitious Hamiltonian, we show that time-dependent configurational Shanon information entropy for a thermodynamic system (of Brownian particles) which is characterized by the absolute temperature, can not be recognized as thermodynamic entropy. At best, it can be identified as a thermodynamic entropy-like quantity. Furthermore, the description based on the fictitious Hamiltonian may lead to the conclusion that the correspondence between the Shanon information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is not a singular feature at equilibrium. It may be a continuation of the correspondence between the information entropy and the thermodynamic entropy-like quantity. Thus, the present study appears to offer important justification for the postulate that the Shannon entropy at steady state may be regarded as a thermodynamic entropy. This postulate holds significant importance in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Stability of flocking in the reciprocal two-species Vicsek model: Effects of relative population, motility, and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural flocks need to cope with various forms of heterogeneities, for instance, their composition, motility, interaction, or environmental factors. Here, we study the effects of such heterogeneities on the flocking dynamics of the reciprocal two-species Vicsek model [Phys. Rev. E 107, 024607 (2023)], which comprises two groups of self-propelled agents with anti-aligning inter-species interactions and exhibits either parallel or anti-parallel flocking states. The parallel and anti-parallel flocking states vanish upon reducing the size of one group, and the system transitions to a single-species flock of the majority species. At sufficiently low noise (or high density), the minority species can exhibit collective behavior, anti-aligning with the liquid state of the majority species. Unequal self-propulsion speeds of the two species strongly encourage anti-parallel flocking over parallel flocking. However, when activity landscapes with region-dependent motilities are introduced, parallel flocking is retained if the faster region is given more space, highlighting the role of environmental constraints. Under noise heterogeneity, the colder species (subjected to lower noise) attain higher band velocity compared to the hotter one, temporarily disrupting any parallel flocking, which is subsequently restored. These findings collectively reveal how different forms of heterogeneity, both intrinsic and environmental, can qualitatively reshape flocking behavior in this class of reciprocal two-species models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Finite XY Chains: A Comparison of Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a geometrical analysis of finite length XY quantum chains. We begin by examining the ground state and the first excited state of the model, emphasizing the impact of finite size effects under two distinct choices of the Jordan Wigner transformation: the Neveu Schwartz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We explore the geometric features of the system by analyzing the quantum (Berry) curvature derived from the Fubini Study metric, which is intimately connected to the quantum Fisher information. This approach uncovers a rich interplay between boundary conditions and quantum geometry. In the gamma h parameter space, we identify distinct sign changing arcs of the curvature, confined to some region. These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where boundary conditions shape quantum geometric properties, offering new insights into finite size topology and the structure of low dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of rotating clusters in active Brownian particles with visual perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the group formation and subsequent dynamics of active particles which are equipped with a visual perception using Langevin dynamics simulations. These particles possess an orientational response to the position of the nearest neighbours which are within a vision cone of these particles. We observe the emergence of rotating clusters when the visual perception of the particles are in the intermediate range. We have found that the persistent motion of these active particles are intimately correlated with the emerging structures by analysing the persistence probability as well as the orientational correlation function. For rotating clusters, the persistent probability is found to be very quickly decaying and orientational correlation function shows oscillatory behaviour.</description>

      <title>Coplanar order induced by emergent frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional frustration arises from the conflict between the spin alignments due to the geometry or the nature of the interactions. Here, we demonstrate a novel form of frustration, dubbed ``emergent frustration'', which is induced by the symmetry that emerges at the phase transition point of a quantum spin model devoid of geometric frustration. We study the two-dimensional bipartite chequerboard $J$-$Q$ model, which hosts the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to the plaquette-singlet solid state (PSS) phase transition detected in the Shastry-Sutherland compound SrCu$_2({\rm BO}_3)_2$. By analyzing the scaling behavior of the R\'enyi entanglement entropy with smooth boundaries at the transition point, we observe an unexpected scaling behavior, which indicates that the number of Goldstone modes is five. We explain this by proposing a novel scenario in which the system is described by an effective quantum rotor Hamiltonian with a three-sublattice geometry that frustrates collinear order while supporting coplanar order. Such a three-sublattice geometry arises from the emergent symmetry of coexisting orders, which may also occur at the AFM-PSS transition point of SrCu$_2({\rm BO}_3)_2$. Therefore, experimental investigations are warranted.</description>

      <title>Metrology of open quantum systems from emitted radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation.</description>

Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the typical probability distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Journey from the Wilson exact RG towards the Wegner-Morris Fokker-Planck RG and the Carosso field-coarsening via Langevin stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the Wilson RG of 'incomplete integration' as a function of the effective RG-time $t$, the non-linear differential RG-flow for the energy $E_t[\phi(.)]$ translates for the probability distribution $P_t[\phi(.)] \sim e^{- E_t[\phi(.)]} $ into the linear Fokker-Planck RG-flow associated to independent non-identical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the Fourier modes. The corresponding Langevin stochastic differential equations for the real-space field $\phi_t(\vec x)$ have been recently interpreted by Carosso as genuine infinitesimal coarsening-transformations that are the analog of spin-blocking, and whose irreversible character is essential to overcome the paradox of the naive description of the Wegner-Morris Continuity-Equation for the RG-flow as a meaningless infinitesimal change of variables in the partition function integral. This interpretation suggests to consider new RG-schemes, in particular the Carosso RG where the Langevin SDE corresponds to the stochastic heat equation also known as the Edwards-Wilkinson dynamics. After a pedestrian self-contained introduction to this stochastic formulation of RG-flows, we focus on the case where the field theory is defined on the large volume $L^d$ with periodic boundary conditions, in order to distinguish between extensive and intensives observables while keeping the translation-invariance. Since the empirical magnetization $m_e \equiv \frac{1}{L^d} \int_{L^d} d^d \vec x \ \phi(\vec x) $ is an intensive variable corresponding to the zero-momentum Fourier coefficient of the field, its probability distribution $p_L(m_e)$ can be obtained from the gradual integration over all the other Fourier coefficients associated to non-vanishing-momenta via an appropriate adaptation of the Carosso stochastic RG, in order to obtain the large deviation properties with respect to the volume $L^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quenched disorder is expected to destroy order, such as when a random field is applied in a 2-dimensional magnetic system. Even when order exists in the presence of disorder, it is usually only the survival of the order of the clean model. We present here a surprising phenomenon where an order, driven by quenched disorder, emerges, that has nothing in common with the order present in the clean model. It's a new type of order by disorder that differs from the usual thermal or quantum one. The classical Heisenberg model on the $J_1-J_3$ kagome lattice is studied by parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, with magnetic site vacancies. After analyzing the effect of a few impurities on the ground state, favoring non-coplanar configurations, we show the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the collinear $q=4$ Potts order, the only order present in the clean system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterized by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In this paper, we predict the exponential spreading rate of an epidemic on a complex network. We first find an expression of the reproduction number for a network, based on the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. We then connect this reproduction number and the disease infectiousness to the spreading rate. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. Our theory bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex networks, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>

      <title>Theory for the Anomalous Phase Behavior of Inertial Active Brownian Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast to equilibrium systems, inertia can profoundly impact the phase behavior of active systems. This has been made particularly evident in recent years, with motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) exhibiting several intriguing dependencies on translational inertia. Here we report extensive simulations characterizing the phase behavior of inertial active matter and develop a mechanical theory for the complete phase diagram without appealing to equilibrium notions. Our theory qualitatively captures all aspects of liquid-gas coexistence, including the critical value of inertia above which MIPS ceases. Notably, our findings highlight that particle softness, and not inertia, is responsible for the MIPS reentrance effect at the center of a proposed active refrigeration cycle.</description>

Abstract: Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and further clarifies why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without further training. Our theory reveals that for single-instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed analytically tractable model thus offers a promising avenue for thinking about how to interpret many intriguing but puzzling properties of large language models.</description>

      <title>Effects of noise-induced coherence on the performance of a four-level laser heat engine</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of noise-induced coherence on the performance analysis of a degenerate four-level quantum heat engine with particular focus on the universal nature of efficiency, which refers to the appearance of the first two universal terms $\eta_C/2$ and $\eta_C^2/8$ in series expansion of the efficiency at maximum power under a left-right symmetry in the system. Firstly, for a two-parameter optimization scheme, we derive an analytic expression for the efficiency at maximum power for the near-equilibrium condition and show that presence of noise-induced coherence breaks the left-right symmetry of the system. However, when the operation of the engine is restricted to either high-temperature or low-temperature regime, we discuss the conditions under which the left-right symmetry can be retained in each case, giving rise to the universal characteristic of efficiency. In case of one-parameter optimization, we show that while the universality of the first linear term $\eta_c/2$ is robust and holds consistently across all conditions, the universality of the quadratic term $\eta_C^2/8$ depends on the constraints imposed on the control parameters. Finally, we examine the behavior of power as a function of noise-induced coherence parameter highlighting the role of matter-field coupling in determining the suitable operation regime for the heat engine to reap the benefits of noise-induced coherence.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory</title>

Abstract: Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary R\'{e}nyi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.</description>
