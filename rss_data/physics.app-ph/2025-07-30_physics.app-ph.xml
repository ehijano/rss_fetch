      <title>Carbon-based Microfabricated Organic Electrochemical Transistors Enabled by Printing and Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are key bioelectronic devices, with applications in neuromorphics, sensing, and flexible electronics. However, their microfabrication typically relies on precious metal contacts manufactured via cleanroom processes. Here, we present a high-throughput additive-subtractive microfabrication strategy for metal-free, flexible OECTs using biodegradable materials and room-temperature processing. Additive manufacturing of large features is achieved via extrusion printing of a water-dispersed graphene ink to fabricate electrode contacts, and spin-coating of a cellulose acetate ink to form both the substrate and encapsulation layer. Combined with femtosecond laser ablation, this approach enables micrometer-resolution patterning of free-standing OECTs with channel openings down to 1 um and sheet resistance below 10 Ohm/sq. By tuning laser parameters, we demonstrate both selective and simultaneous ablation strategies, enabling the fabrication horizontal, vertical, and planar-gated OECTs, as well as complementary NOT gate inverters. Thermal degradation studies in air show that over 80% of the device mass decomposes below 360 deg C, providing a low-energy route for device disposal and addressing the environmental impact of electronic waste. This approach offers a cleanroom-free and lithography-free pathway toward the rapid prototyping of high-resolution, sustainable organic electronics, combining material circularity, process simplicity, and architectural versatility for next-generation bioelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Direct single-shot phase difference retrieval of two wavelength in off-axis digital holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for direct phase difference reconstruction using single-shot dual-wavelength off-axis digital holography is presented. This approach enables direct imaging of samples with high steps without the need to reconstruct phase images at each individual wavelength. As the dual wavelengths in the reference and object arms pass through a common path in this configuration, single-wavelength arrangements can be applied. Due to the unique capability of the presented method, a sodium-vapor lamp source has been utilized to obtain two closely spaced wavelengths (${\lambda}1 = 589 nm$ and ${\lambda}2 = 589.6 nm$), with in a synthetic wavelength of ${\Lambda} = 578.8 \mu m$ in the Michelson configuration. To evaluate the validity of the method, the height of an air wedge measured using the proposed approach has been compared with the result obtained from phase unwrapping in the single-wavelength method. The capability of the proposed technique to image samples with high step structures is further demonstrated by measuring a $30 \mu m$ step height and a glass plate with a thickness of approximately $140 \mu m$.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.09$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.11$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.797 \pm 0.088$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.442 \pm 0.104$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity electro-optic modulation for advanced pulse-comb synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity electro-optic (EO) modulation plays a pivotal role in optical pulse and frequency comb synthesis, supporting a wide range of applications including communication, computing, ranging, and quantum information. The ever-growing demand for these applications has driven efforts in enhancing modulation coupling strength and bandwidth towards advanced pulse-comb synthesis. However, the effects of strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity EO modulation remain underexplored, due to the lack of a general, unified model that captures this extreme condition. In this work, we present a universal framework for pulse-comb synthesis under cavity EO modulation, where coupling strength and modulation bandwidth far exceed the cavity's free spectral range (FSR). We show that, under such intense and ultrafast driving conditions, EO-driven frequency combs and pulses exhibit rich higher-order nonlinear dynamics, including temporal pulse compression and comb generation with arbitrary pump detuning. Leveraging this framework, we reveal a direct link between the higher-order dynamics of EO pulse-comb generation and the band structure of synthetic dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate arbitrary comb shaping via machine-learning-based inverse microwave drive design, achieving a tenfold enhancement in cavity electro-optic comb flatness by exploring the synergistic effects of high-bandwidth driving and detuning-induced frequency boundaries. Our findings push cavity electro-optic modulation into a new frontier, unlocking significant potential for universal and machine-learning-programmable electro-optic frequency combs, topological photonics, as well as photonic quantum computing in the strong-coupling and high-bandwidth regimes.</description>

      <title>Post-compression of a Q-switched laser in a glass-rod multi-pass cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-switched lasers are compact, cost-effective, and highly pulse energy-scalable sources for nanosecond-scale laser pulses. The technology has been developed for many decades and is widely used in scientific, industrial and medical applications. However, their inherently narrow bandwidth imposes a lower limit on pulse duration - typically in the few-hundred-picosecond range - limiting the applicability of Q-switched technology in fields that require ultrafast laser pulses in the few-picosecond or femtosecond regime. In contrast, mode-locked lasers can produce broad-band, ultrafast (&lt; 1 ps) pulses, but are complex, expensive, and typically require a large footprint. To bridge the parameter gap between these two laser platforms - in terms of pulse duration and achievable peak power - we here propose a Herriott-type multi-pass cell (MPC) based post-compression scheme for shortening the pulse durations of Q-switched lasers down to the ultrafast, picosecond regime. We experimentally demonstrate post-compression of 0.5 ns, 1 mJ pulses from a Q-switched laser to 24 ps using a compact glass-rod MPC for spectral broadening. We verify this result numerically and show that compression down to a few picoseconds is possible using the nanosecond MPC (nMPC).</description>

      <title>Magnetization switching by current in an elemental ferromagnetic single layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current-induced magnetization switching, a fundamental phenomenon related to spin-transport of electrons, enables non-voltaic and fast information write, facilitating applications in low-power memory and logic devices. However, magnetization switching by spin-orbit torques is usually attributed to current flowing in the nonmagnetic metal layer of multilayers or in magnetic alloys with heavy elements. Here, we report perpendicular magnetization switching induced by current flowing in an elemental ferromagnet nickel single layer. This prototype structure demonstrates that current-induced magnetization switching is a general phenomenon of magnet. The results suggest that the current induces an effective transverse magnetic field with an out-of-plane component leading to the magnetization switching, different to the conventional spin-orbit torques. Our work opens the new insight and reveals the intrinsic mechanism of current-induced torques.</description>
