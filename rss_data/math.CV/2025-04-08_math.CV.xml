      <title>Bounded domains on Kobayashi hyperbolic manifolds covering compact complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of a uniformization theorem in several complex variables leads to a desire to classify all of the simply connected domains. We use established computational methods and a localization technique to generalize a recently-published classification. In particular, we show that if a domain with $C^{1,1}$ boundary on a Kobayashi hyperbolic complex manifold contains a totally real boundary point and covers a compact manifold, then its universal cover must be the Euclidean ball.</description>

      <title>On the Hardy number and the Bergman number of a planar domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with functions with a prefixed range and their inclusions in Hardy and weighted Bergman spaces. This idea was originally introduced by Hansen for Hardy spaces, and it was recently taken into weighted Bergman spaces by Karafyllia and Karamanlis. We provide a new characterization for the Hardy number of a domain in terms of its Green function. Based on this, we present a class of domains for which the Hardy number and the Bergman number coincide. However, in general, we show that the Hardy number and the Bergman number of a domain are not equal; even for domains which are regular for the Dirichlet problem.</description>

      <title>Numerical computation of Stephenson's g-functions in multiply connected domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been much recent attention on $h$-functions, so named since they describe the distribution of harmonic measure for a given multiply connected domain with respect to some basepoint. In this paper, we focus on a closely related function to the $h$-function, known as the $g$-function, which originally stemmed from questions posed by Stephenson in [3]. Computing the values of the $g$-function for a given planar domain and some basepoint in this domain requires solving a Dirichlet boundary value problem whose domain and boundary condition change depending on the input argument of the $g$-function. We use a well-established boundary integral equation method to solve the relevant Dirichlet boundary value problems and plot various graphs of the $g$-functions for different multiply connected circular and rectilinear slit domains.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Some Well-Known Polynomial Inequalities for the Modified Smirnov Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P(z)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. In this paper, we consider the modified Smirnov operator, which carries a polynomial $P(z)$ into $\tilde{\mathbb{S}}_a[P](z)=(1+az)P'(z)-naP(z),$ where $a$ is an arbitrary number in $\overline{\mathbb{D}}$. We estimate minimum and maximum moduli of modified Smirnov operator of $P(z)$ on the unit circle with restricted zeros and thereby obtain a generalization of some results of Dewan and Hans \cite{dewan2013some}. This study includes compact generalization of some well-known polynomial inequalities.</description>

      <title>On the cyclic behavior of singular inner functions in Besov and sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of singular inner functions that are cyclic in some Besov-type spaces of analytic functions over the unit disc. Our sufficient condition is stated only in terms of the modulus of smoothness of the underlying measure. Such singular inner functions are cyclic also in the space $\ell^p_A$ of holomorphic functions with coefficients in $\ell^p$. This can only happen for measures that place no mass on any Beurling-Carleson set.</description>

      <title>The Cowen-Douglas class and de Branges-Rovnyak spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between the de Branges-Rovnyak spaces and the Cowen-Douglas class of operators which is associated with complex geometric structures. We prove that the backward shift operator on a de Branges-Rovnyak space never belongs to the Cowen-Douglas class when the symbol is an extreme point of the closed unit ball of $H^\infty$ (the algebra of bounded analytic functions on the open unit disk). On the contrary, in the non extreme case, it always belongs to the Cowen-Douglas class of rank one. Additionally, we compute the curvature in this case and derive certain exotic results on unitary equivalence and angular derivatives.</description>

      <title>Zero Products of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy and Bergman spaces over an annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zero product problem of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space and Bergman space over an annulus. Assuming a condition on the Fourier expansion of the symbols, we show that there are no zero divisors in the class of Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space of the annulus. Using the reduction theorem due to Abrahamse, we characterize compact Hankel operators on the Hardy space of the annulus, which also leads to a zero product result. Similar results are proved for the Bergman space over the annulus.</description>

      <title>Fractal Zeta Functions and Complex Dimensions of Ahlfors Metric Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While classical analysis dealt primarily with smooth spaces, much research has been done in the last half century on expanding the theory to the nonsmooth case. Metric Measure spaces are the natural setting for such analysis, and it is thus important to understand the geometry of subsets of these spaces. In this paper we will focus on the geometry of Ahlfors regular spaces, Metric Measure spaces with an additional regularity condition. Historically, fractals have been studied using different ideas of dimension which have all proven to be unsatisfactory to some degree. The theory of complex dimensions, developed by M.L. Lapidus and a number of collaborators, was developed in part to better understand fractality in the Euclidean case and seeks to overcome these problems. Of particular interest is the recent theory of complex dimensions in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, as studied by M.L.Lapidus, G. Radunovi\'c, and D. Zubrini\'c, who introduced and studied the properties of the distance zeta function $\zeta_A$. We will show that this theory of complex dimensions naturally generalizes to the case of Ahlfors regular spaces, as the distance zeta function can be modified to these spaces and all of its main properties carry over. We also provide a selection of examples in Ahlfors spaces, as well as hints that the theory can be expanded to a more general setting.</description>

      <title>The H\"{o}rmander--Bernhardsson extremal function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the function $\varphi$ of minimal $L^1$ norm among all functions $f$ of exponential type at most $\pi$ for which $f(0)=1$. This function, studied by H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real zeros $\pm \tau_n$, $n=1,2, \ldots$. Starting from the fact that $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ is an $\ell^2$ sequence, established in an earlier paper of ours, we identify $\varphi$ in the following way. We factor $\varphi(z)$ as $\Phi(z)\Phi(-z)$, where $\Phi(z)= \prod_{n=1}^\infty(1+(-1)^n\frac{z}{\tau_n})$ and show that $\Phi$ satisfies a certain second order linear differential equation along with a functional equation either of which characterizes $\Phi$. We use these facts to establish an odd power series expansion of $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ in terms of $(n+\frac12)^{-1}$ and a power series expansion of the Fourier transform of $\varphi$, as suggested by the numerical work of H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson. The dual characterization of $\Phi$ arises from a commutation relation that holds more generally for a two-parameter family of differential operators, a fact that is used to perform high precision numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Defining equations of $7$-dimensional model CR hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18588v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$ that are Levi degenerate with constant rank Levi form, and moreover finitely nondegenerate. Each of these can be described as a deformation of a model CR hypersurface by adding terms of higher natural weighted order to the model's defining equation. We obtain a complete normal form for models of real analytic uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$, and present a detailed study of their local invariants. The normal form illustrates that $2$-nondegenerate models in $\mathbb{C}^4$ comprise a moduli space parameterized by two univariate holomorphic functions, which is in sharp contrast to the well known Levi-nondegenerate setting and the more recently discovered behavior of $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^3$. In further contrast to these previously studied settings, we demonstrate that not all $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^4$ arise as perturbations of homogeneous models. We derive defining equations for the homogeneous $2$-nondegenerate models, a set of $9$ structures, and find explicit formulas for their infinitesimal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Bending Teichm\"uller spaces and character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15394v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mapping $b_L\colon\mathcal{T} \to \chi$ of the Fricke-Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}$ into the $\mathrm{PSL}_2\mathbb{C}$-character variety $\chi$ of the surface, obtained by holonomy representations of bent hyperbolic surfaces along a fixed measured lamination $L$. We prove that this mapping is an equivariant symplectic real-analytic embedding, and, for almost all measured laminations, proper.
  In addition, we show that this "being map'' $b_L\colon \mathcal{T} \to \chi$ continuously extends to a mapping from Thurston's boundary of $\mathcal{T}$ to the Morgan-Shalen boundary of $\chi$ as the identity map almost everywhere.
  Moreover, we complexify the real analytic subvariety ${\rm Im}\, b_L$ after symplecitcaly embedding it in the product variety $\chi \times \chi$ by the diagonal mapping twisted by complex conjugation. More precisely, we geometrically construct a closed $\mathbb{C}$-symplectic complex analytic subvariety of $\chi \times \chi$ containing ${\rm Im}\, b_L$ as a half-dimensional real analytic subvariety.</description>

      <title>The Brownian loop measure on Riemann surfaces and applications to length spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a simple identity relating the length spectrum of a Riemann surface to that of the same surface with an arbitrary number of additional cusps. Our proof uses the Brownian loop measure introduced by Lawler and Werner. In particular, we express the total mass of Brownian loops in a fixed free homotopy class on any Riemann surface in terms of the length of the geodesic representative for the complete constant curvature metric. This expression also allows us to write the electrical thickness of a compact set in $\mathbb C$ separating $0$ and $\infty$, or the Velling--Kirillov K\"ahler potential, in terms of the Brownian loop measure and the zeta-regularized determinant of Laplacian as a renormalization of the Brownian loop measure with respect to the length spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several results about functions which preserve the Schur-Agler class under Hadamard or coefficient-wise product. First, functions which preserve the Schur class necessarily preserve the Schur-Agler class. Second, ``moments'' of certain commuting operator tuples form coefficients of Schur-Agler class preservers. Finally, any preserver of the full matrix Schur-Agler class must have coefficients given by moments of commuting operator tuples. We also point out that any counterexample to the multivariable von Neumann inequality can be used to derive a non-trivial Agler class preserver.</description>
