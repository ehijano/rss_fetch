      <title>Emergence and co-existence of periodic and unstructured motion in future-avoiding random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-avoiding random walks on graphs can be seen as walkers interacting with their own past history. This letter considers a complementary class of dynamics: Mutual future avoiding random walks (MFARWs), where stochastically driven walkers are avoiding each others planned future trajectories. Such systems arise naturally in conceptual models of shared mobility. We show that periodic behavior emerges spontaneously in such MFARWs, and that periodic and unstructured behavior coexist, providing a first example of Chimera style behavior of non-oscillatory paths on networks. Further, we analytically describe and predict the onset of structure. We find that the phase transition from unstructured to periodic behavior is driven by a novel mechanism of self-amplifying coupling to the periodic components of the stochastic drivers of the system. In the context of shared mobility applications, these Chimera states imply a regime of naturally stable co-existence between flexible and line-based public transport.</description>

      <title>Noisy nonlocal aggregation model with gradient flow structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems provide a fundamental framework for modeling collective behavior in biological, social, and physical systems. In many applications, stochastic perturbations are essential for capturing environmental variability and individual uncertainty, yet their impact on long-term dynamics and equilibrium structure remains incompletely understood, particularly in the presence of nonlocal interactions. We investigate a stochastic interacting particle system governed by potential-driven interactions and its continuum density formulation in the large-population limit. We introduce an energy functional and show that the macroscopic density evolution has a gradient-flow structure in the Wasserstein-2 space. The associated variational framework yields equilibrium states through constrained energy minimization and illustrates how noise regulates the density and mitigates singular concentration. We demonstrate the connection between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions through numerical examples in one and two dimensions. Within the variational framework, we compute energy minimizers and perform a linear stability analysis. The numerical results show that the stable minimizers agree with the long-time dynamics of the macroscopic density model.</description>
