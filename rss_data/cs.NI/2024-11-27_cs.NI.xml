      <title>A Primer on AP Power Save in Wi-Fi 8: Overview, Analysis, and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi facilitates the Internet connectivity of billions of devices worldwide, making it an indispensable technology for modern life. Wi-Fi networks are becoming significantly denser, making energy consumption and its effects on operational costs and environmental sustainability crucial considerations. Wi-Fi has already introduced several mechanisms to enhance the energy efficiency of non-Access Point (non-AP) stations (STAs). However, the reduction of energy consumption of APs has never been a priority. Always-on APs operating at their highest capabilities consume significant power, which affects the energy costs of the infrastructure owner, aggravates the environmental impact, and decreases the lifetime of battery-powered APs. IEEE 802.11bn, which will be the basis of Wi-Fi 8, makes a big leap forward by introducing the AP Power Save (PS) framework. In this article, we describe and analyze the main proposals discussed in the IEEE 802.11bn Task Group (TGbn), such as Scheduled Power Save, (Semi-)Dynamic Power Save, and Cross Link Power Save. We also consider other proposals that are being discussed in TGbn, namely the integration of Wake-up Radios (WuR) and STA offloading. We then showcase the potential benefits of AP PS using a public dataset collected from 470 real APs deployed in a university campus. Our numerical analysis reveals that AP power consumption could be decreased on average by at least 28%. Finally, we outline the open challenges that need to be addressed to optimally integrate AP PS in Wi-Fi and ensure its compatibility with legacy devices.</description>

      <title>Generative vs. Predictive Models in Massive MIMO Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems are essential for 5G/6G networks to meet high throughput and reliability demands, with machine learning (ML)-based techniques, particularly autoencoders (AEs), showing promise for practical deployment. However, standard AEs struggle under noisy channel conditions, limiting their effectiveness. This work introduces a Vector Quantization-based generative AE model (VQ-VAE) for robust mMIMO cross-antenna channel prediction. We compare Generative and Predictive AE-based models, demonstrating that Generative models outperform Predictive ones, especially in noisy environments. The proposed VQ-VAE achieves up to 15 [dB] NMSE gains over standard AEs and about 9 [dB] over VAEs. Additionally, we present a complexity analysis of AE-based models alongside a diffusion model, highlighting the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enabling Skip Graphs to Process K-Dimensional Range Queries in a Mobile Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A skip graph is a resilient application-layer routing structure that supports range queries of distributed k-dimensional data. By sorting deterministic keys into groups based on locally computed random membership vectors, nodes in a standard skip graph can optimize range query performance in mobile networks such as unmanned aerial vehicle swarms. We propose a skip graph extension that inverts the key and membership vector roles and bases group membership on deterministic vectors derived from the z-ordering of k-dimensional data and sorting within groups is based on locally computed random keys.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented Ethical Hacking: A Practical Examination of Manual Exploitation and Privilege Escalation in Linux Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of generative AI (GenAI) within manual exploitation and privilege escalation tasks in Linux-based penetration testing environments, two areas critical to comprehensive cybersecurity assessments. Building on previous research into the role of GenAI in the ethical hacking lifecycle, this paper presents a hands-on experimental analysis conducted in a controlled virtual setup to evaluate the utility of GenAI in supporting these crucial, often manual, tasks. Our findings demonstrate that GenAI can streamline processes, such as identifying potential attack vectors and parsing complex outputs for sensitive data during privilege escalation. The study also identifies key benefits and challenges associated with GenAI, including enhanced efficiency and scalability, alongside ethical concerns related to data privacy, unintended discovery of vulnerabilities, and potential for misuse. This work contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted cybersecurity by emphasising the importance of human-AI collaboration, especially in contexts requiring careful decision-making, rather than the complete replacement of human input.</description>

      <title>Exploring QUIC Dynamics: A Large-Scale Dataset for Encrypted Traffic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QUIC, an increasingly adopted transport protocol, addresses limitations of TCP by offering improved security, performance, and features such as stream multiplexing and connection migration. However, these enhancements also introduce challenges for network operators in monitoring and analyzing web traffic, especially due to QUIC's encryption. Existing datasets are inadequate they are often outdated, lack diversity, anonymize critical information, or exclude essential features like SSL keys-limiting comprehensive research and development in this area. We introduce VisQUIC, a publicly available dataset of over 100,000 labeled QUIC traces with corresponding SSL keys, collected from more than 40,000 websites over four months. By generating visual representations of the traces, we facilitate advanced machine learning (ML) applications and in-depth analysis of encrypted QUIC traffic. To demonstrate the dataset's potential, we estimate the number of HTTP3 request-response pairs in a QUIC connection using only encrypted traffic, achieving up to 92% accuracy. This estimation provides insights into server behavior, client-server interactions, and connection load-crucial for tasks like load balancing and intrusion detection. Our dataset enables comprehensive studies on QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols and supports the development of tools for encrypted traffic analysis.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Fractional Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Age-Minimal Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of emerging real-time networked applications like cyber-physical systems (CPS), the Age of Information (AoI) has merged as a pivotal metric for evaluating the timeliness. To meet the high computational demands, such as those in intelligent manufacturing within CPS, mobile edge computing (MEC) presents a promising solution for optimizing computing and reducing AoI. In this work, we study the timeliness of computational-intensive updates and explores jointly optimize the task updating and offloading policies to minimize AoI. Specifically, we consider edge load dynamics and formulate a task scheduling problem to minimize the expected time-average AoI. The fractional objective introduced by AoI and the semi-Markov game nature of the problem render this challenge particularly difficult, with existing approaches not directly applicable. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework to fractional reinforcement learning (RL). We first introduce a fractional single-agent RL framework and prove its linear convergence. We then extend this to a fractional multi-agent RL framework with a convergence analysis. To tackle the challenge of asynchronous control in semi-Markov game, we further design an asynchronous model-free fractional multi-agent RL algorithm, where each device makes scheduling decisions with the hybrid action space without knowing the system dynamics and decisions of other devices. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms reduce the average AoI by up to 52.6% compared with the best baseline algorithm in our experiments.</description>
