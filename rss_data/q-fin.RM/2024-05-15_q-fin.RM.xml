      <title>Optimizing Deep Reinforcement Learning for American Put Option Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the existing literature on hedging American options with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The study first investigates hyperparameter impact on hedging performance, considering learning rates, training episodes, neural network architectures, training steps, and transaction cost penalty functions. Results highlight the importance of avoiding certain combinations, such as high learning rates with a high number of training episodes or low learning rates with few training episodes and emphasize the significance of utilizing moderate values for optimal outcomes. Additionally, the paper warns against excessive training steps to prevent instability and demonstrates the superiority of a quadratic transaction cost penalty function over a linear version. This study then expands upon the work of Pickard et al. (2024), who utilize a Chebyshev interpolation option pricing method to train DRL agents with market calibrated stochastic volatility models. While the results of Pickard et al. (2024) showed that these DRL agents achieve satisfactory performance on empirical asset paths, this study introduces a novel approach where new agents at weekly intervals to newly calibrated stochastic volatility models. Results show DRL agents re-trained using weekly market data surpass the performance of those trained solely on the sale date. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that both single-train and weekly-train DRL agents outperform the Black-Scholes Delta method at transaction costs of 1% and 3%. This practical relevance suggests that practitioners can leverage readily available market data to train DRL agents for effective hedging of options in their portfolios.</description>

      <title>Partially Law-Invariant Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of partial law invariance, generalizing the concept of law-invariant risk measures widely used in statistical and financial applications. This new concept is motivated by practical considerations of decision-making under uncertainty, thus connecting the literature on decision theory and that on financial risk management. We fully characterize partially law-invariant coherent risk measures via a novel representation formula, which, surprisingly, has little resemblance to the classical formula for law-invariant coherent risk measures. A notion of strong partial law invariance is introduced, allowing for a representation formula akin to the classical one. We propose a few classes of new risk measures, including partially law-invariant versions of the Expected Shortfall and the entropic risk measures, and illustrate their applications in risk assessment under model uncertainty.</description>
