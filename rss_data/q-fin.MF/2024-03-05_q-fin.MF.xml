      <title>Justifying the Volatility of S&amp;P 500 Daily Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 60 years, there has been a gradual increase in the volatility of daily returns for the S&amp;P 500 Index. Hypothetically, suppose that market forces determine daily volatility such that a daily leveraged S&amp;P 500 fund cannot outperform a standard S&amp;P 500 fund in the long run. Then this hypothetical volatility happens to support the increase in volatility seen in the S&amp;P 500 index. On this basis, it appears that the classic argument of the market portfolio being unbeatable in the long run is determining the volatility of S&amp;P 500 daily returns. Moreover, it follows that the long-term volatility of the daily returns for the S&amp;P 500 Index should continue to increase until passing a particular threshold. If, on the other hand, this hypothesis about market forces increasing volatility is invalid, then there is room for daily leveraged S&amp;P 500 funds to outperform their unleveraged counterparts in the long run.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQG Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of Hilbert space-valued Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) mean field games (MFGs), generalizing the classic LQG mean field game theory to scenarios where the state equations are driven by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, state and control processes take values in separable Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the state equations involve infinite dimensional noises, namely $Q$-Wiener processes. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population appearing in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of each agent involves the state, control, and the average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of coupled infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations, which forms the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. Next, we develop the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and obtain a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting Hilbert space-valued MFG. Finally, we establish the $\epsilon$-Nash property for the finite-player game in Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>On the implied volatility of Asian options under stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the short-time behavior of the at-the-money implied volatility for arithmetic Asian options with fixed strike price. The asset price is assumed to follow the Black-Scholes model with a general stochastic volatility process. Using techniques of the Malliavin calculus such as the anticipating Ito's formula we first compute the level of the implied volatility of the option when the maturity converges to zero. Then, we find and short maturity asymptotic formula for the skew of the implied volatility that depends on the roughness of the volatility model. We apply our general results to the SABR model and the rough Bergomi model, and provide some numerical simulations that confirm the accurateness of the asymptotic formula for the skew.</description>

      <title>Gamma Hedging and Rough Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply rough path theory to study the discrete-time gamma-hedging strategy. We show that if a trader knows that the market price of a set of European options will be given by a diffusive pricing model, then the discrete-time gamma-hedging strategy will enable them to replicate other European options so long as the underlying pricing signal is sufficiently regular. This is a sure result and does not require that the underlying pricing signal has a quadratic variation corresponding to a probabilisitic pricing model. We show how to generalise this result to exotic derivatives when the gamma is defined to be the Gubinelli derivative of the delta by deriving rough-path versions of the Clark--Ocone formula which hold surely.
  We illustrate our theory by proving that so long as the stock price process and the implied volatility process of a call option are sufficiently regular, one can replicate any European derivative with smooth payoff and the same maturity as the call option, so long the underlying is not equal to the strike at maturity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic portfolio selection under generalized disappointment aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the continuous-time portfolio selection problem under generalized disappointment aversion (GDA). The implicit definition of the certainty equivalent within GDA preferences introduces time inconsistency to this problem. We provide the sufficient and necessary condition for a strategy to be an equilibrium by a fully nonlinear integral equation. Investigating the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the integral equation, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium. Our findings indicate that under disappointment aversion preferences, non-participation in the stock market is the unique equilibrium. The semi-analytical equilibrium strategies obtained under the constant relative risk aversion utility functions reveal that, under GDA preferences, the investment proportion in the stock market consistently remains smaller than the investment proportion under classical expected utility theory. The numerical analysis shows that the equilibrium strategy's monotonicity concerning the two parameters of GDA preference aligns with the monotonicity of the degree of risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Local Volatility in Interest Rate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local Volatility (LV) is a very powerful tool for market modeling. This tool can be used to generate arbitrage-free scenarios calibrated to all available options. Here we demonstrate how to implement LV in order to reproduce most swaption prices within a single model.
  There was a good agreement between market prices and Monte Carlo prices for all tenors and maturities from 2 to 20 years. Note that due to the use of a normal distribution in the scenario generation process, the volatility of short-term swaptions cannot be generated accurately.</description>
