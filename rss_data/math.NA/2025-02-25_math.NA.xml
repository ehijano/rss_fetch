      <title>On the computation of the cumulative distribution function of the Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain various series and asymptotic expansions involving the modified Bessel function of the second kind for the normal inverse Gaussian cumulative distribution function. The new expansions accelerate computations, complementing the numerical integration methods implemented in statistical software packages. We also provide a detailed description of the algorithm and its corresponding implementation in C++. The performance and accuracy of the algorithm are extensively tested and benchmarked with open-source implementations, offering superior accuracy and speed-ups of a factor from 5 to 60.</description>

      <title>Fast Converging Parallel Offline-Online Iterative Multiscale Mixed Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Multiscale Robin Coupled Method with Oversampling and Smoothing (MRCM-OS) to develop two highly efficient iterative multiscale methods. The MRCM-OS methodology demonstrated the ability to achieve flux error magnitudes on the order of $10^{-4}$ in a challenging industry benchmark, namely the SPE10 permeability field. The two newly proposed iterative procedures, through the construction of online informed spaces, significantly enhance the solution accuracy, reaching flux error magnitudes of order $10^{-10}$ for a reduced number of steps.
  The proposed methods are based on the construction of online informed spaces, which are iteratively refined to improve solution accuracy. Following an initial offline stage, where known boundary conditions are applied to construct multiscale basis functions, the informed spaces are updated through iterative procedures that utilize boundary conditions defined by the most recently computed solution variables. Two distinct approaches are introduced, each leveraging this framework to deliver efficient and accurate iterative solutions.
  A series of numerical simulations, conducted on the SPE10 benchmark, demonstrates the very rapid convergence of the iterative solutions. These results highlight the computational efficiency and competitiveness of the two proposed methods, which are thoroughly compared to each other and to an existing multiscale iterative method from the literature.</description>

      <title>Upwind-and-shifted numerical scheme for fractional convection equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental solution of a space fractional convection equation of order $\alpha$ is the probability density function of L\'{e}vy flights with long-tailed $\alpha$-stable jump length distribution. By studying an upwind second-order implicit finite difference scheme for the equation with $\alpha\in(0,1)$, an upwind-and-shifted scheme with order $3-\alpha$ is obtained in this paper, and the scheme is shown to be unconditionally stable for a wide range of $\alpha$. Numerical examples, including simulations on a probability density function, are presented showing the effectiveness of the numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>An equal-order virtual element framework for the coupled Stokes-Temperature equation with nonlinear viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present and analyze a novel stabilized virtual element formulation for the coupled Stokes-Temperature equation on polygonal meshes, employing equal-order element pairs where viscosity depends on temperature. The main objective of the proposed virtual elements is to develop a stabilized virtual element problem that avoids higher-order derivative terms and bilinear forms involving velocity, pressure and temperature, thereby avoiding the coupling between virtual element pairs. Moreover, it also reduces the violation of divergence-free constraints and offers reasonable control over the gradient of temperature. We derive the stability of the continuous solution using the Banach fixed-point theorem under sufficiently small data. The stabilized coupled virtual element problem is formulated using the local projection-based stabilization methods. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the stabilized discrete solution using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and the contraction theorem under the assumption of sufficient small data by showing the well-posedness of the stabilized decoupled virtual element problems. Furthermore, we derive the error estimates with optimal convergence rates in the energy norms. We present several numerical examples to confirm the theoretical findings. Additionally, the numerical behavior of the proposed stabilized method is shown to be robust with respect to linear and non-linear thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Flow-based linear embedding for Bayesian filtering of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian filtering for high-dimensional nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems is a fundamental yet challenging problem in many fields of science and engineering. Existing methods face significant obstacles: Gaussian-based filters struggle with non-Gaussian distributions, sequential Monte Carlo methods are computationally intensive and prone to particle degeneracy in high dimensions, and deep learning approaches often fail to balance accuracy and efficiency in complex filtering tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a flow-based Bayesian filter (FBF) that integrates normalizing flows to construct a latent linear state-space model with Gaussian filtering distributions. This framework enables efficient density estimation and sampling through invertible transformations provided by normalizing flows, which can be learned directly from data, thereby eliminating the need for prior knowledge of system dynamics or observation models. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of FBF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Partially Explicit Splitting with Mass Lumping for High-Contrast Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, contrast-independent partially explicit time discretization for wave equations in heterogeneous high-contrast media via mass lumping is concerned. By employing a mass lumping scheme to diagonalize the mass matrix, the matrix inversion procedures can be avoided, thereby significantly enhancing computational efficiency especially in the explicit part. In addition, after decoupling the resulting system, higher order time discretization techniques can be applied to get better accuracy within the same time step size. Furthermore, the spatial space is divided into two components: contrast-dependent ("fast") and contrast-independent ("slow") subspaces. Using this decomposition, our objective is to introduce an appropriate time splitting method that ensures stability and guarantees contrast-independent discretization under suitable conditions. We analyze the stability and convergence of the proposed algorithm. In particular, we discuss the second order central difference and higher order Runge-Kutta method for a wave equation. Several numerical examples are presented to confirm our theoretical results and to demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves high accuracy while reducing computational costs for high-contrast problems.</description>

      <title>An alternating approach for reconstructing the initial value and source term in a time-fractional diffusion-wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to addressing the simultaneous inversion problem involving the initial value and space-dependent source term in a time-fractional diffusion-wave equation. Firstly, we establish the uniqueness of the inverse problem by leveraging the asymptotic expansion of Mittag-Leffler functions. Subsequently, we decompose the inverse problem into two subproblems and introduce an alternating iteration reconstruction method, complemented by a regularization strategy. Additionally, a comprehensive convergence analysis for this method is provided. To solve the inverse problem numerically, we introduce two semidiscrete schemes based on standard Galerkin method and lumped mass method, respectively. Furthermore, we establish error estimates that are associated with the noise level, iteration step, regularization parameter, and spatial discretization parameter. Finally, we present several numerical experiments in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Posteriori Error Estimation for Pressure-Robust Finite Element Methods Applied to the Stokes Optimal Control Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper study a posteriori error estimates for the pressure-robust finite element method, which incorporates a divergence-free reconstruction operator, within the context of the distributed optimal control problem constrained by the Stokes equations. We develop an enhanced residual-based a posteriori error estimator that is independent of pressure and establish its global reliability and efficiency. The proposed a posteriori error estimator enables the separation of velocity and pressure errors in a posteriori error estimation, ensuring velocity-related estimates are free of pressure influence. Numerical experiments confirm our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Pressure-robustness in Stokes-Darcy Optimal Control Problem with reconstruction operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a pressure-robust discretizations, specifically within the context of optimal control problems for the Stokes-Darcy system. The study meticulously revisits the formulation of the divergence constraint and the enforcement of normal continuity at interfaces, within the framework of the mixed finite element method (FEM). The methodology involves the strategic deployment of a reconstruction operator, which is adeptly applied to both the constraint equations and the cost functional. This is complemented by a judicious selection of finite element spaces that are tailored for approximation and reconstruction purposes. The synergy of these methodological choices leads to the realization of a discretization scheme that is pressure-robust, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of numerical simulations in computational mathematics.</description>

      <title>An optimal complexity spectral solver for the Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a spectral solver for the Poisson equation on a square domain, achieving optimal complexity through the ultraspherical spectral method and the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method. Compared with the state-of-the-art spectral solver for the Poisson equation \cite{for}, our method not only eliminates the need for conversions between Chebyshev and Legendre bases but also is applicable to more general boundary conditions while maintaining spectral accuracy. We prove that, for solutions with sufficient smoothness, a fixed number of ADI iterations suffices to meet a specified tolerance, yielding an optimal complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. The solver can also be extended to other equations as long as they can be split into two one-dimensional operators with nearly real and disjoint spectra. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can resolve solutions with millions of unknowns in under a minute, with significant speedups when leveraging low-rank approximations.</description>

      <title>Splitting finite element approximations for quasi-static electroporoelasticity equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electroporoelasticity model, which couples Maxwell's equations with Biot's equations, plays a critical role in applications such as water conservancy exploration, earthquake early warning, and various other fields. This work focuses on investigating its well-posedness and analyzing error estimates for a splitting backward Euler finite element method. We first define a weak solution consistent with the finite element framework. Then, we prove the uniqueness and existence of such a solution using the Galerkin method and derive a priori estimates for high-order regularity. Using a splitting technique, we define an approximate splitting solution and analyze its convergence order. Next, we apply Nedelec's curl-conforming finite elements, Lagrange elements, and the backward Euler method to construct a fully discretized scheme. We demonstrate the stability of the splitting numerical solution and provide error estimates for its convergence order in both temporal and spatial variables. Finally, we present numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results, showing that our method significantly reduces computational complexity compared to the classical finite element method.</description>

      <title>A nonnegativity-preserving finite element method for a class of parabolic SPDEs with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a prototypical parabolic SPDE with finite-dimensional multiplicative noise, which, subject to a nonnegative initial datum, has a unique nonnegative solution. Inspired by well-established techniques in the deterministic case, we introduce a finite element discretization of this SPDE that is convergent and which, subject to a nonnegative initial datum and unconditionally with respect to the spatial discretization parameter, preserves nonnegativity of the numerical solution throughout the course of evolution. We perform a mathematical analysis of this method. In addition, in the associated linear setting, we develop a fully discrete scheme that also preserves nonnegativity, and we present numerical experiments that illustrate the advantages of the proposed method over alternative finite element and finite difference methods that were previously considered in the literature, which do not necessarily guarantee nonnegativity of the numerical solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the convergence analysis of time-splitting schemes for the nonlinear Klein--Gordon/wave equation under rough initial data. The optimal error bounds of the Lie splitting and the Strang splitting are established with sharp dependence on the regularity index of the solution from a wide range that is approaching the lower bound for well-posedness. Particularly for very rough data, the technique of discrete Bourgain space is utilized and developed, which can apply for general second-order wave models. Numerical verifications are provided.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Ritz Projection for Finite Element Methods in Fluid-Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regardless of the development of various finite element methods for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, optimal-order convergence of finite element discretizations of the FSI problems in the $L^\infty(0,T;L^2)$ norm has not been proved due to the incompatibility between standard Ritz projections and the interface conditions in the FSI problems. To address this issue, we define a dynamic Ritz projection (which satisfies a dynamic interface condition) associated to the FSI problem and study its approximation properties in the $L^\infty(0,T;H^1)$ and $L^\infty(0,T;L^2)$ norms. Existence and uniqueness of the dynamic Ritz projection of the solution, as well as estimates of the error between the solution and its dynamic Ritz projection, are established. By utilizing the established results, we prove optimal-order convergence of finite element methods for the FSI problem in the $L^\infty(0,T;L^2)$ norm.</description>

      <title>Block CG algorithms revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to clarify the relationship between the block Lanczos and the block conjugate gradient (BCG) algorithms. Under the full rank assumption for the block vectors, we show the one-to-one correspondence between the algorithms. This allows, for example, the computation of the block Lanczos coefficients in BCG. The availability of block Jacobi matrices in BCG opens the door for further development, e.g., for error estimation in BCG based on (modified) block Gauss quadrature rules. Driven by the need to get a practical variant of the BCG algorithm well suited for computations in finite precision arithmetic, we also discuss some important variants of BCG due to Dubrulle. These variants avoid the troubles with a possible rank deficiency within the block vectors. We show how to incorporate preconditioning and computation of Lanczos coefficients into these variants. We hope to help clarify which variant of the block conjugate gradient algorithm should be used for computations in finite precision arithmetic. Numerical results illustrate the performance of different variants of BCG on some examples.</description>

      <title>On the Global Optimality of Fibonacci Lattices in the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the question of the optimality of Fibonacci lattices with respect to tensor product energies on the torus, most notably the periodic $L_2$-discrepancy, diaphony and the worst case error of the quasi-Monte Carlo integration over certain parametrized dominating mixed smoothness Sobolev spaces $H_p^d$ of periodic functions. We consider two methods for this question.
  First, a method based on Delsarte's LP-bound from coding theory which will give us, among others, the Fibonacci lattices as the natural candidates for optimal point sets. Second, we will adapt the continuous LP-bound on the sphere (and other spaces) to the torus to get optimality in the continuous setting.
  We conclude with a more in depth look at the $5$-point Fibonacci lattice, giving an effectively computable algorithm for checking if it is optimal and rigorously proving its optimality for quasi-Monte Carlo integration in the range $0 &lt; p \leq 11.66$. We also prove a result on the universal optimality of $3$ points in any dimension.
  The novelty of this approach is the application of LP-methods for tensor product energies in the torus and the systematic study of the simultaneous global optimality of periodic point sets for a class of tensor product potential functions.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of the adaptive Milstein method for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with piecewise continuous arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, an adaptive time-stepping Milstein method is constructed for stochastic differential equations with piecewise continuous arguments (SDEPCAs), where the drift is one-sided Lipschitz continuous and the diffusion does not impose the commutativity condition. It is widely recognized that explicit Euler or Milstein methods may blow up when the system exhibits superlinear growth, and modifications are needed. Hence we propose an adaptive variant to deal with the case of superlinear growth drift coefficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to develop a numerical method with variable step sizes for nonlinear SDEPCAs. It is proven that the adaptive Milstein method is strongly convergent in the sense of $L_p, p\ge 2$, and the convergence rate is optimal, which is consistent with the order of the explicit Milstein scheme with globally Lipschitz coefficients. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>A General Framework of Linear Elasticity Enhanced Multiscale Coupling Methods for Crystalline Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomistic-to-continuum (a/c) coupling methods, also known as the quasicontinuum (QC) methods, are a important class of concurrent multisacle methods for modeling and simulating materials with defects. The a/c methods aim to balance the accuracy and efficiency by coupling a molecular mechanics model (also termed as the atomistic model) in the vicinity of localized defects with the Cauchy-Born approximation of the atomistic model in the elastic far field. However, since both the molecular mechanics model and its Cauchy-Born approximation are usually a nonlinear, it potentially leads to a high computational cost for large-scale simulations. In this work, we propose an advancement of the classic quasinonlocal (QNL) a/c coupling method by incorporating a linearized Cauchy-Born model to reduce the computational cost. We present a rigorous a priori error analysis for this QNL method with linear elasticity enhancement (QNLL method), and show both analytically and numerically that it achieves the same convergence behavior as the classic (nonlinear) QNL method by proper determination of certain parameters relating to domain decomposition and finite element discretization. More importantly, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the QNLL method perform an substantial improvement of the computational efficiency in term of CPU times.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of a fine-tunable F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an model for foldable and bilayer plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical scheme is proposed to identify low energy configurations of a F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an model for bilayer plates. The dependency of the corresponding elastic energy on the in-plane displacement $u$ and the out-of-plane deflection $w$ leads to a practical minimization of the functional via a decoupled gradient flow. In particular, the energies of the resulting iterates are shown to be monotonically decreasing. The discretization of the model relies on $P1$ finite elements for the horizontal part $u$ and utilizes the discrete Kirchhoff triangle for the vertical component $w$. The model allows for analysing various different problem settings via numerical simulation: (i) stable low-energy configurations are detected dependent on a specified prestrain described by elastic material properties, (ii) curvature inversions of spherical and cylindrical configurations are investigated, (iii) elastic responses of foldable cardboards for different spontaneous curvatures and crease geometries are compared.</description>

      <title>Deep collocation methods: A framework for solving PDEs using neural networks with error control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown significant potential in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). While deep networks are capable of approximating complex functions, direct one-shot training often faces limitations in both accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive method that uses single-hidden-layer neural networks to construct basis functions guided by the equation residual. The approximate solution is computed within the space spanned by these basis functions, employing a collocation least squares scheme. As the approximation space gradually expands, the solution is iteratively refined; meanwhile, the progressive improvements serve as a reliable error indicator, guiding the termination of the sequential updates. Additionally, we introduce adaptive strategies for collocation point selection to enhance robustness, along with parameter initialization techniques to improve the expressiveness of the neural networks. The proposed method is validated through numerical experiments on various PDEs, demonstrating both its accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>A Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method for cell-centred finite volume solid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods in finite-volume solid mechanics. Traditional Newton-based approaches require explicit Jacobian matrix formation and storage, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. In contrast, Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods approximate the Jacobian's action using finite differences, combined with Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalised minimal residual method (GMRES), enabling seamless integration into existing segregated finite-volume frameworks without major code refactoring. This work proposes and benchmarks the performance of a compact-stencil Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method against a conventional segregated approach on a suite of test cases, encompassing varying geometric dimensions, nonlinearities, dynamic responses, and material behaviours. Key metrics, including computational cost, memory efficiency, and robustness, are evaluated, along with the influence of preconditioning strategies and stabilisation scaling. Results show that the proposed Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method outperforms the segregated approach in all linear and nonlinear elastic cases, achieving order-of-magnitude speedups in many instances; however, divergence is observed in elastoplastic cases, highlighting areas for further development. It is found that preconditioning choice impacts performance: a LU direct solver is fastest in small to moderately-sized cases, while a multigrid method is more effective for larger problems. The findings demonstrate that Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods are promising for advancing finite-volume solid mechanics simulations, particularly for existing segregated frameworks where minimal modifications enable their adoption. The described implementations are available in the solids4foam toolbox for OpenFOAM, inviting the community to explore, extend, and compare these procedures.</description>

      <title>The Stability and Accuracy of The Adams-Bashforth-type Integrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents stability and accuracy analysis of a high-order explicit time stepping scheme introduced by \cite[Section 2.2]{Buvoli2019}, which exhibits superior stability compared to classical Adams-Bashforth. A conjecture that is supported by several numerical phenomena in \cite[Figure 2.5]{Buvoli2018}, the method appears to remain stable when the accuracy approaches infinity, although it is not yet proven. It is regrettable that this hypothesis has been refuted from a fundamental perspective in harmonic analysis. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, this method displays considerably enhanced stability in comparison to conventional explicit schemes. Furthermore, we present a criterion for ascertaining the maximum permissible accuracy for a given specific parabolic stability radius. Conversely, the original method will lose one order associated with the expected accuracy, which can be recovered with a slight modification. Consequently, a unified analysis strategy for the \( L^2 \)-stability will be presented for extensional PDEs under the CFL condition. Finally, a selection of representative numerical examples will be shown in order to substantiate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>An SMT Formalization of Mixed-Precision Matrix Multiplication: Modeling Three Generations of Tensor Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many recent computational accelerators provide non-standard (e.g., reduced precision) arithmetic operations to enhance performance for floating-point matrix multiplication. Unfortunately, the properties of these accelerators are not widely understood and lack sufficient descriptions of their behavior. This makes it difficult for tool builders beyond the original vendor to target or simulate the hardware correctly, or for algorithm designers to be confident in their code. To address these gaps, prior studies have probed the behavior of these units with manually crafted tests. Such tests are cumbersome to design, and adapting them as the accelerators evolve requires repeated manual effort.
  We present a formal model for the tensor cores of Nvidia's Volta, Turing, and Ampere GPUs. We identify specific properties -- rounding mode, precision, and accumulation order -- that drive these cores' behavior. We formalize these properties and then use the formalization to automatically generate discriminating inputs that illustrate differences among machines. Our results confirm many of the findings of previous tensor core studies, but also identify subtle disagreements. In particular, Nvidia's machines do not, as previously reported, use round-to-zero for accumulation, and their 5-term accumulator requires 3 extra carry-out bits for full accuracy. Using our formal model, we analyze two existing algorithms that use half-precision tensor cores to accelerate single-precision multiplication with error correction. Our analysis reveals that the newer algorithm, designed to be more accurate than the first, is actually less accurate for certain inputs.</description>

      <title>A Cut-Based BAT-MCS Approach for Binary-State Network Reliability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BAT-MCS is an integrated Monte Carlo simulation method (MCS) that combines a binary adaptation tree algorithm (BAT) with a self-regulating simulation mechanism. The BAT algorithm operates deterministically, while the Monte Carlo simulation method is stochastic. By hybridizing these two approaches, BAT-MCS successfully reduces variance, increases efficiency, and improves the quality of its binary-state network reliability. However, it has two notable weaknesses. First, the selection of the supervectors, sub-vectors that form the core of BAT-MCS, is overly simplistic, potentially affecting overall performance. Second, the calculation of the approximate reliability is complicated, which limits its strength in reducing variance. In this study, a new BAT-MCS called cBAT-MCS is proposed to enhance the performance of the BAT-MCS. The approach reduces the complexity of MCS. Selecting the super-vector based on a novel layer-cut approach can reduce both runtime and variance. Extensive numerical experiments on large-scale binary-state network demonstrate that the proposed new cBAT-MCS outperforms traditional MCS and original BAT-MCS approaches in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Boltzsim: A fast solver for the 1D-space electron Boltzmann equation with applications to radio-frequency glow discharge plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving the one-dimensional space collisional Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for electrons in low-temperature plasmas (LTPs). Modeling LTPs is useful in many applications, including advanced manufacturing, material processing, and hypersonic flows, to name a few. The proposed BTE solver is based on an Eulerian formulation. It uses Chebyshev collocation method in physical space and a combination of Galerkin and discrete ordinates in velocity space. We present self-convergence results and cross-code verification studies compared to an in-house particle-in-cell (PIC) direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code. Boltzsim is our open source implementation of the solver. Furthermore, we use Boltzsim to simulate radio-frequency glow discharge plasmas (RF-GDPs) and compare with an existing methodology that approximates the electron BTE. We compare these two approaches and quantify their differences as a function of the discharge pressure. The two approaches show an 80x, 3x, 1.6x, and 0.98x difference between cycle-averaged time periodic electron number density profiles at 0.1 Torr, 0.5 Torr, 1 Torr, and 2 Torr discharge pressures, respectively. As expected, these differences are significant at low pressures, for example less than 1 Torr.</description>

      <title>SUperman: Efficient Permanent Computation on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16577v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The permanent is a function, defined for a square matrix, with applications in various domains including quantum computing, statistical physics, complexity theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. Its formula is similar to that of the determinant, however unlike the determinant, its exact computation is #P-complete, i.e., there is no algorithm to compute the permanent in polynomial time unless P=NP. For an $n \times n$ matrix, the fastest algorithm has a time complexity of $O(2^{n-1}n)$. Although supercomputers have been employed for permanent computation before, there is no work and more importantly, no publicly available software that leverages cutting-edge, yet widely accessible, High-Performance Computing accelerators such as GPUs. In this work, we designed, developed, and investigated the performance of SUperman, a complete software suite that can compute matrix permanents on multiple nodes/GPUs on a cluster while handling various matrix types, e.g., real/complex/binary and sparse/dense etc., with a unique treatment for each type. Compared to a state-of-the-art parallel algorithm on 44 cores, SUperman can be $86\times$ faster on a single Nvidia A100 GPU. Combining multiple GPUs, we also showed that SUperman can compute the permanent of a $56 \times 56$ matrix which is the largest reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm with Fixed Linear Ramp Schedule for Truss Structure Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel structural optimization framework based on quantum variational circuits, in which the multiplier acting on the cross-sectional area of each rod in a truss structure as an updater is used as a design variable. Specifically, we employ a classical processor for structural analysis with the finite element method, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is subsequently performed to update the cross-sectional area so that the compliance is minimized. The advantages of this framework can be seen in three key aspects. First, by defining design variables as multipliers, rather than simply reducing the design variable to a binary candidate of inclusion or exclusion (corresponding to qubit states, ``0" and ``1"), it provides greater flexibility in adjusting the cross-sectional area of the rod at each iteration of the optimization process. Second, the multipliers acting on rods are encoded with on-off encoding, eliminating additional constraints in the convergence judgement. As a result, the objective function is in a simple format, enabling efficient optimization using QAOA.Third, a fixed linear ramp schedule (FLRS) for variational parameter setting bypasses the classical optimization process, thereby improving the operational efficiency of the framework. In the two structural cases investigated in this study, the proposed approach highlights the feasibility and applicability potential of quantum computing in advancing engineering design and optimization. Numerical experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework, providing a firm foundation for future research on quantum-assisted optimization methods in engineering fields.</description>

      <title>Deep-reinforcement-learning-based separation control in a two-dimensional airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to discover new active-flow-control (AFC) techniques for separation mitigation in a two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil at a Reynolds number of 3000. To find these AFC strategies, a framework consisting of a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) agent has been used to determine the action strategies to apply to the flow. The actions involve blowing and suction through jets at the airfoil surface. The flow is simulated with the numerical code Alya, which is a low-dissipation finite-element code, on a high-performance computing system. Various control strategies obtained through DRL led to 43.9% drag reduction, while others yielded an increase in aerodynamic efficiency of 58.6%. In comparison, periodic-control strategies demonstrated lower energy efficiency while failing to achieve the same level of aerodynamic improvements as the DRL-based approach. These gains have been attained through the implementation of a dynamic, closed-loop, time-dependent, active control mechanism over the airfoil.</description>

      <title>BGG Sequences -- A Riemannian perspective</title>

Abstract: BGG resolutions and generalized BGG resolutions from representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras have been generalized to sequences of invariant differential operators on manifolds endowed with a geometric structure belonging to the family of parabolic geometries. Two of these structures, conformal structures and projective structures occur as weakenings of a Riemannian metric respectively of a specified torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle. In particular, one obtains BGG sequences on open subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ as very special cases of the construction. It turned out that several examples of the latter sequences are of interest in applied mathematics, since they can be used to construct numerical methods to study operators relevant for elasticity theory, numerical relativity and related fields.
  This article is intended to provide an intermediate level between BGG sequences for parabolic geometries and the case of domains in $\mathbb R^n$. We provide a construction of conformal BGG sequences on Riemannian manifolds and of projective BGG sequences on manifolds endowed with a volume preserving linear connection on their tangent bundle. These constructions do not need any input from parabolic geometries. Except from standard differential geometry methods the only deeper input comes from representation theory. So one can either view the results as a simplified version of the constructions for parabolic geometries in an explicit form. Alternatively, one can view them as providing an extension of the simplified constructions for domains in $\Bbb R^n$ to general Riemannian manifolds or to manifolds endowed with an appropriate connection on the tangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Convergence Guarantees for Unmixing PSFs over a Manifold with Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of recovering the parameters of a mixture of spike signals convolved with different PSFs is considered. Herein, the spike support is assumed to be known, while the PSFs lie on a manifold. A non-linear least squares estimator of the mixture parameters is formulated. In the absence of noise, a lower bound on the radius of the strong basin of attraction i.e., the region of convergence, is derived. Key to the analysis is the introduction of coherence and interference functions, which capture the conditioning of the PSF manifold in terms of the minimal separation of the support. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings. Finally, the practicality and efficacy of the non-linear least squares approach are showcased on spectral data from laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Giga-scale Kernel Matrix Vector Multiplication on GPU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.01085v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel matrix-vector multiplication (KMVM) is a foundational operation in machine learning and scientific computing. However, as KMVM tends to scale quadratically in both memory and time, applications are often limited by these computational constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel approximation procedure coined \textit{Faster-Fast and Free Memory Method} ($\fthreem$) to address these scaling issues of KMVM for tall~($10^8\sim 10^9$) and skinny~($D\leq7$) data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\fthreem$ has empirical \emph{linear time and memory} complexity with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$ and can compute a full KMVM for a billion points \emph{in under a minute} on a high-end GPU, leading to a significant speed-up in comparison to existing CPU methods. We demonstrate the utility of our procedure by applying it as a drop-in for the state-of-the-art GPU-based linear solver FALKON, \emph{improving speed 1.5-5.5 times} at the cost of $&lt;1\%$ drop in accuracy. We further demonstrate competitive results on \emph{Gaussian Process regression} coupled with significant speedups on a variety of real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A mixed precision preconditioned Jacobi method for the symmetric eigenvalue problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenvalue problem is a fundamental problem in scientific computing. In this paper, we first give the error analysis for a single step or sweep of Jacobi's method in floating point arithmetic. Then we propose a mixed precision preconditioned Jacobi method for the symmetric eigenvalue problem: We first compute the eigenvalue decomposition of a real symmetric matrix by an eigensolver at low precision and we obtain a low-precision matrix of eigenvectors; Then by using the high-precision modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process, a high-precision orthogonal matrix is obtained, which is used as an initial guess for Jacobi's method. The rounding error analysis of the proposed method is established under some conditions. We also present a mixed precision preconditioned one-sided Jacobi method for the singular value problem and the corresponding rounding error analysis is discussed. Numerical experiments on CPUs and GPUs are reported to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method over the original Jacobi method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10519v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the monomial basis is generally as good as a well-conditioned polynomial basis for interpolation, provided that the condition number of the Vandermonde matrix is smaller than the reciprocal of machine epsilon. This leads to a practical algorithm for piecewise polynomial interpolation over general regions in the complex plane using the monomial basis. Our analysis also yields a new upper bound for the condition number of an arbitrary Vandermonde matrix, which generalizes several previous results.</description>

      <title>Finite element hybridization of port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06239v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we extend the hybridization framework for the Hodge Laplacian [Awanou et al., Hybridization and postprocessing in finite element exterior calculus, 2023] to port-Hamiltonian systems describing linear wave propagation phenomena. To this aim, a dual field mixed Galerkin discretization is introduced, in which one variable is approximated via conforming finite element spaces, whereas the second is completely local. This scheme is equivalent to the second order mixed Galerkin formulation and retains a discrete power balance and discrete conservation laws. The mixed formulation is also equivalent to the hybrid formulation. The hybrid system can be efficiently solved using a static condensation procedure in discrete time. The size reduction achieved thanks to the hybridization is greater than the one obtained for the Hodge Laplacian as one field is completely discarded. Numerical experiments on the 3D wave and Maxwell equations show the convergence of the method and the size reduction achieved by the hybridization.</description>

      <title>Linear multistep methods with repeated global Richardson extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we further investigate the application of the well-known Richardson extrapolation (RE) technique to accelerate the convergence of sequences resulting from linear multistep methods (LMMs) for numerically solving initial-value problems of systems of ordinary differential equations. By extending the ideas of our previous paper, we now utilize some advanced versions of RE in the form of repeated RE (RRE). Assume that the underlying LMM -- the base method -- has order $p$ and RE is applied $l$ times. Then we prove that the accelerated sequence has convergence order $p+l$. The version we present here is global RE (GRE, also known as passive RE), since the terms of the linear combinations are calculated independently. Thus, the resulting higher-order LMM-RGRE methods can be implemented in a parallel fashion and existing LMM codes can directly be used without any modification. We also investigate how the linear stability properties of the base method (e.g. $A$- or $A(\alpha)$-stability) are preserved by the LMM-RGRE methods.</description>

      <title>Extending Elman's Bound for GMRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the numerical range of a matrix is contained in the right half of the complex plane, the GMRES algorithm for solving linear systems will reduce the norm of the residual at every iteration. In his Ph.D. dissertation, Howard Elman derived a bound that guarantees convergence. When the numerical range contains the origin, GMRES need not make progress at every step and Elman's bound does not apply, even if all the eigenvalues are located in the right half-plane. However by solving a Lyapunov equation, one can construct an inner product in which the numerical range is contained in the right half-plane. One can then bound GMRES (run in the standard Euclidean norm) by applying Elman's bound in this new inner product, at the cost of a multiplicative constant that characterizes the distortion caused by the change of inner product. Using Lyapunov inverse iteration, one can build a family of such inner products, trading off the location of the numerical range with the size of constant. This approach complements techniques that Greenbaum and colleagues have recently proposed for excising the origin from the numerical range to gain greater insight into the convergence of GMRES for nonnormal matrices.</description>

      <title>Mixed precision iterative refinement for least squares with linear equality constraints and generalized least squares problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent development on mixed precision techniques has largely enhanced the performance of various linear algebra solvers, one of which being the solver for the least squares problem $\min_{x}\lVert b-Ax\rVert_{2}$. By transforming least squares problems into augmented linear systems, mixed precision techniques are capable of refining the lower precision solution to the working precision. In this paper, we propose mixed precision iterative refinement algorithms for two variants of least squares problems -- the least squares problem with linear equality constraints (LSE) and the generalized least squares problem (GLS). Both classical and GMRES-based iterative refinement can be applied to augmented systems of these two problems to improve the accuracy of the solution. For reasonably well-conditioned problems, our algorithms reduce the execution time by a factor of 40% on average compared to the fixed precision ones from LAPACK on the x86-64 architecture.</description>

Abstract: It is proposed to use stochastic differential equations with state-dependent switching rates (SDEwS) for sampling from finite mixture distributions. An Euler scheme with constant time step for SDEwS is considered. It is shown that the scheme converges with order one in weak sense and also in the ergodic limit. Numerical experiments illustrate the use of SDEwS for sampling from mixture distributions and confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A priori and a posteriori error bounds for the fully mixed FEM formulation of poroelasticity with stress-dependent permeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a family of mixed finite element methods for a model of nonlinear poroelasticity where, thanks to a rewriting of the constitutive equations, the permeability depends on the total poroelastic stress and on the fluid pressure and therefore we can use the Hellinger--Reissner principle with weakly imposed stress symmetry for Biot's equations. The problem is adequately structured into a coupled system consisting of one saddle-point formulation, one linearised perturbed saddle-point formulation, and two off-diagonal perturbations. This system's unique solvability requires assumptions on regularity and Lipschitz continuity of the inverse permeability, and the analysis follows fixed-point arguments and the Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi theory. The discrete problem is shown uniquely solvable by applying similar fixed-point and saddle-point techniques as for the continuous case. The method is based on the classical PEERS$_k$ elements, it is exactly momentum and mass conservative, and it is robust with respect to the nearly incompressible as well as vanishing storativity limits. We derive a priori error estimates, we also propose fully computable residual-based a posteriori error indicators, and show that they are reliable and efficient with respect to the natural norms, and robust in the limit of near incompressibility. These a posteriori error estimates are used to drive adaptive mesh refinement. The theoretical analysis is supported and illustrated by several numerical examples in 2D and 3D.</description>

Abstract: The fast computation of large kernel sums is a challenging task, which arises as a subproblem in any kernel method. We approach the problem by slicing, which relies on random projections to one-dimensional subspaces and fast Fourier summation. We prove bounds for the slicing error and propose a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approach for selecting the projections based on spherical quadrature rules. Numerical examples demonstrate that our QMC-slicing approach significantly outperforms existing methods like (QMC-)random Fourier features, orthogonal Fourier features or non-QMC slicing on standard test datasets.</description>

      <title>A Flexible GMRES Solver with Reduced Order Model Enhanced Synthetic Acceleration Preconditioenr for Parametric Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric radiative transfer equation (RTE) occurs in multi-query applications such as uncertainty quantification, inverse problems, and sensitivity analysis, which require solving RTE multiple times for a range of parameters. Consequently, efficient iterative solvers are highly desired.
  Classical Synthetic Acceleration (SA) preconditioners for RTE build on low order approximations to an ideal kinetic correction equation such as its diffusion limit in Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA). Their performance depends on the effectiveness of the underlying low order approximation. In addition, they do not leverage low rank structures with respect to the parameters of the parametric problem.
  To address these issues, we proposed a ROM-enhanced SA strategy, called ROMSAD, under the Source Iteration framework in Peng (2024). In this paper, we further extend the ROMSAD preconditioner to flexible general minimal residual method (FGMRES). The main new advancement is twofold. First, after identifying the ideal kinetic correction equation within the FGMRES framework, we reformulate it into an equivalent form, allowing us to develop an iterative procedure to construct a ROM for this ideal correction equation without directly solving it. Second, we introduce a greedy algorithm to build the underlying ROM for the ROMSAD preconditioner more efficiently.
  Our numerical examples demonstrate that FGMRES with the ROMSAD preconditioner (FGMRES-ROMSAD) is more efficient than GMRES with the right DSA preconditioner. Furthermore, when the underlying ROM in ROMSAD is not highly accurate, FGMRES-ROMSAD exhibits greater robustness compared to Source Iteration accelerated by ROMSAD.</description>

      <title>A Linear-complexity Tensor Butterfly Algorithm for Compressing High-dimensional Oscillatory Integral Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a multilevel tensor compression algorithm called tensor butterfly algorithm for efficiently representing large-scale and high-dimensional oscillatory integral operators, including Green's functions for wave equations and integral transforms such as Radon transforms and Fourier transforms. The proposed algorithm leverages a tensor extension of the so-called complementary low-rank property of existing matrix butterfly algorithms. The algorithm partitions the discretized integral operator tensor into subtensors of multiple levels, and factorizes each subtensor at the middle level as a Tucker-type interpolative decomposition, whose factor matrices are formed in a multilevel fashion. For a $d$-dimensional integral operator discretized into a $2d$-mode tensor with $n^{2d}$ entries, the overall CPU time and memory requirement scale as $O(n^d)$, in stark contrast to the $O(n^d\log n)$ requirement of existing matrix algorithms such as matrix butterfly algorithm and fast Fourier transforms (FFT), where $n$ is the number of points per direction. When comparing with other tensor algorithms such as quantized tensor train (QTT), the proposed algorithm also shows superior CPU and memory performance for tensor contraction. Remarkably, the tensor butterfly algorithm can efficiently model high-frequency Green's function interactions between two unit cubes, each spanning 512 wavelengths per direction, which represents over $512\times$ larger problem sizes than existing butterfly algorithms. On the other hand, for a problem representing 64 wavelengths per direction, which is the largest size existing algorithms can handle, our tensor butterfly algorithm exhibits 200x speedups and $30\times$ memory reduction comparing with existing ones. Moreover, the tensor butterfly algorithm also permits $O(n^d)$-complexity FFTs and Radon transforms up to $d=6$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents score-based sequential Langevin sampling (SSLS), a novel approach to nonlinear data assimilation within a recursive Bayesian framework. The proposed method decomposes the assimilation process into alternating prediction and update steps, leveraging dynamic models for state prediction while incorporating observational data through score-based Langevin Monte Carlo during updates. To address challenges in posterior sampling, we introduce an annealing strategy within the update mechanism. We provide theoretical guarantees for SSLS convergence in total variation (TV) distance under certain conditions, providing insights into error behavior with respect to key hyper-parameters. Our numerical experiments across challenging scenarios -- including high-dimensional systems, strong nonlinearity, and sparse observations -- demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, SSLS effectively quantifies the uncertainty associated with the estimated states, making it particularly valuable for the error calibration.</description>

      <title>A symmetric boundary integral formulation for time-domain acoustic-elastic scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification). Numerical examples are provided for two-dimensional examples.</description>

Abstract: Power systems, including synchronous generator systems, are typical systems that strive for stable operation. In this article, we numerically study the fault transient process of a synchronous generator system based on the first benchmark model. That is, we make it clear whether an originally stable generator system can restore its stability after a short time of unstable transient process. To achieve this, we construct a structure-preserving method and compare it with the existing and frequently-used predictor-corrector method. We newly establish a reductive form of the circuit system and accelerate the reduction process. Also a switching method between two stages in the fault transient process is given. Numerical results show the effectiveness and reliability of our method.</description>

      <title>Numerics and analysis of Cahn--Hilliard critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.03689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore recent progress and open questions concerning local minima and saddle points of the Cahn--Hilliard energy in $d\geq 2$ and the critical parameter regime of large system size and mean value close to $-1$. We employ the String Method of E, Ren, and Vanden-Eijnden -- a numerical algorithm for computing transition pathways in complex systems -- in $d=2$ to gain additional insight into the properties of the minima and saddle point. Motivated by the numerical observations, we adapt a method of Caffarelli and Spruck to study convexity of level sets in $d\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Control of Instability in a Vlasov-Poisson System Through an External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma instabilities are a major concern in plasma science, for applications ranging from particle accelerators to nuclear fusion reactors. In this work, we consider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an external electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to determining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear analysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select external electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities present in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation are known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium with a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that we propose in this work.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the SiMPL method for density-based topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous convergence analysis of a new method for density-based topology optimization that provides point-wise bound preserving design updates and faster convergence than other popular first-order topology optimization methods. Due to its strong bound preservation, the method is exceptionally robust, as demonstrated in numerous examples here and in the companion article [31]. Furthermore, it is easy to implement with clear structure and analytical expressions for the updates. Our analysis covers two versions of the method, characterized by the employed line search strategies. We consider a modified Armijo backtracking line search and a Bregman backtracking line search. For both line search algorithms, our algorithm delivers a strict monotone decrease in the objective function and further intuitive convergence properties, e.g., strong and pointwise convergence of the density variables on the active sets, norm convergence to zero of the increments, convergence of the Lagrange multipliers, and more. In addition, the numerical experiments demonstrate apparent mesh-independent convergence of the algorithm. We refer to the new algorithm as the SiMPL method, pronounced like ``simple", which stands for {Si}gmoidal {M}irror descent with a {P}rojected {L}atent variable.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving quantum algorithms for linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are fundamental mathematical models spanning virtually all physical scales. A critical property for the robustness and stability of computational methods in such systems is the underlying symplectic structure, which preserves geometric properties like phase-space volume over time and energy conservation over an extended period. In this paper, we present quantum algorithms that incorporate symplectic integrators, ensuring the preservation of this key structure. We demonstrate how these algorithms maintain the symplectic properties for both linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the computational complexity, showing that our approach offers both accuracy and improved efficiency over classical algorithms. These results highlight the potential application of quantum algorithms for solving large-scale Hamiltonian systems while preserving essential physical properties.</description>

      <title>A Simple Introduction to the SiMPL Method for Density-Based Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for solving density-based topology optimization problems: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent variable (SiMPL). The SiMPL method (pronounced as ``the simple method'') optimizes a design using only first-order derivative information of the objective function. The bound constraints on the density field are enforced with the help of the (negative) Fermi--Dirac entropy, which is also used to define a non-symmetric distance function called a Bregman divergence on the set of admissible designs. This Bregman divergence leads to a simple update rule that is further simplified with the help of a so-called latent variable. Because the SiMPL method involves discretizing the latent variable, it produces a sequence of pointwise-feasible iterates, even when high-order finite elements are used in the discretization. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms other popular first-order optimization algorithms. To outline the general applicability of the technique, we include examples with (self-load) compliance minimization and compliant mechanism optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Backtracking New Q-Newton's method for finding roots of meromorphic functions in 1 complex variable: Global convergence, and local stable/unstable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find roots of meromorphic functions.
  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with $\deg (P)&gt;\deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set $\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real analytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements A and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an initial point $z_0$ which is not a pole of $f$.
  A) If $z_0\in\mathbf{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a root of $f$.
  B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point - but not a root - of $f$.
  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial, the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic curves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ is contained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds for general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do not require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic function $f$ is generic.
  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and heuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by the authors. In particular, the dynamics of BNQN (an iterative method) seems to have some striking similarities to Newton's method (a continuous method) and the classical Poincar\'e-Bendixon theorem for differentiable real dynamical systems on the complex plane. This is the more interesting given that discrete versions of Newton's method (e.g. Relaxed Newton's method) does not behave this way.</description>

      <title>Variable aggregation for nonlinear optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variable aggregation has been largely studied as an important pre-solve algorithm for optimization of linear and mixed-integer programs. Although some nonlinear solvers and algebraic modeling languages implement variable aggregation as a pre-solve, the impact it can have on constrained nonlinear programs is unexplored. In this work, we formalize variable aggregation as a pre-solve algorithm to develop reduced-space formulations of nonlinear programs. A novel approximate maximum variable aggregation strategy is developed to aggregate as many variables as possible. Furthermore, aggregation strategies that preserve the problem structure are compared against approximate maximum aggregation. Our results show that variable aggregation can generally help to improve the convergence reliability of nonlinear programs. It can also help in reducing total solve time. However, Hessian evaluation can become a bottleneck if aggregation significantly increases the number of variables appearing nonlinearly in many constraints.</description>
