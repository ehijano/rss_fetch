      <title>Ringmaster: How to juggle high-throughput host OS system calls from TrustZone TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many safety-critical systems require timely processing of sensor inputs to avoid potential safety hazards. Additionally, to support useful application features, such systems increasingly have a large rich operating system (OS) at the cost of potential security bugs. Thus, if a malicious party gains supervisor privileges, they could cause real-world damage by denying service to time-sensitive programs. Many past approaches to this problem completely isolate time-sensitive programs with a hypervisor; however, this prevents the programs from accessing useful OS services
  We introduce Ringmaster, a novel framework that enables enclaves or TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) to asynchronously access rich, but potentially untrusted, OS services via Linux's io_uring. When service is denied by the untrusted OS, enclaves continue to operate on Ringmaster's minimal ARM TrustZone kernel with access to small, critical device drivers. This approach balances the need for secure, time-sensitive processing with the convenience of rich OS services. Additionally, Ringmaster supports large unmodified programs as enclaves, offering lower overhead compared to existing systems. We demonstrate how Ringmaster helps us build a working highly-secure system with minimal engineering. In our experiments with an unmanned aerial vehicle, Ringmaster achieved nearly 1GiB/sec of data into enclave on a Raspberry Pi4b, 0-3% throughput overhead compared to non-enclave tasks.</description>

      <title>AERO: Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA Updates for Energy-Harvesting IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) devices operate under intermittent energy availability, which disrupts task execution and makes energy-intensive over-the-air (OTA) updates particularly challenging. Conventional OTA update mechanisms rely on reboots and incur significant overhead, rendering them unsuitable for intermittently powered systems. Recent live OTA update techniques reduce reboot overhead but still lack mechanisms to ensure consistency when updates interact with runtime execution. This paper presents AERO, an Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA update mechanism that integrates update tasks into the device's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and schedules them alongside routine tasks under energy and timing constraints. By identifying update-affected execution regions and dynamically adjusting dependencies, AERO ensures consistent up date integration while adapting to intermittent energy availability. Experiments on representative workloads demonstrate improved update reliability and efficiency compared to existing live update approaches.</description>

      <title>DAVOS: An Autonomous Vehicle Operating System in the Vehicle Computing Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle computing represents a fundamental shift in how autonomous vehicles are designed and deployed, transforming them from isolated transportation systems into mobile computing platforms that support both safety-critical, real-time driving and data-centric services. In this setting, vehicles simultaneously support real-time driving pipelines and a growing set of data-driven applications, placing increased responsibility on the vehicle operating system to coordinate computation, data movement, storage, and access. These demands highlight recurring system considerations related to predictable execution, data and execution protection, efficient handling of high-rate sensor data, and long-term system evolvability, commonly summarized as Safety, Security, Efficiency, and Extensibility (SSEE). Existing vehicle operating systems and runtimes address these concerns in isolation, resulting in fragmented software stacks that limit coordination between autonomy workloads and vehicle data services. This paper presents DAVOS, the Dependable Autonomous Vehicle Operating System, a unified vehicle operating system architecture designed for the vehicle computing context. DAVOS provides a cohesive operating system foundation that supports both real-time autonomy and extensible vehicle computing within a single system framework.</description>
