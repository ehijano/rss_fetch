      <title>Non-resonant invariant foliations of quasi-periodically forced systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence and uniqueness of invariant foliations about invariant tori in analytic discrete-time dynamical systems. The parametrisation method is used prove the result. Our theory is a foundational block of data-driven model order reduction, that can only be carried out using invariant foliations. The theory is illustrated by two mechanical examples, where instantaneous frequencies and damping ratios are calculated about the invariant tori.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a memory-based diffusion model with spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of a spatially heterogeneous single population model with the memory effect and nonlinear boundary condition. By virtue of the implicit function theorem and Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, spatially nonconstant positive steady state solutions appear from two trivial solutions, respectively. By using bifurcation analysis, the Hopf bifurcation associated with one spatially nonconstant positive steady state is found to occur. The results complement the existing ones. Specifically, it is found that with the interaction of spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear boundary condition, when the memory term is stronger than the interaction of the interior reaction term and the boundary one, the memory-based diffusive model has a single stability switch from stability to instability, with the increase of the delayed memory value. Therefore, the memory delay will lead to a single stability switch of such memory-based diffusive model and consequently the Hopf bifurcation will happen in the model.</description>

      <title>BCZ map is weakly mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BCZ map was introduced in 2001 by Boca, Cobeli and Zaharescu as a tool to study the statistical properties of Farey sequences, whose relation to Riemann Hypothesis dates back to Franel and Landau. Later, J. Athreya and the first author observed that the BCZ map arises as a Poincare section of horocycle flow, establishing both ergodicity as well as zero measure-theoretic entropy. In this article, we prove that the BCZ map is weakly mixing, answering the last remaining question about the BCZ map raised in a 2006 survey by Boca and Zaharescu. The proof uses a self-similarity property of the BCZ map that derives from a well-known fact that horocycle flow is renormalized by the geodesic flow, a property already observed in arXiv:1206.6597. We note that the questions of mixing and rigidity remain open.</description>

      <title>Dynamical importance and network perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the adjacency matrix of a graph exerts much influence on the behavior of dynamical processes on that graph. It is thus relevant to relate notions of the importance (specifically, centrality measures) of network structures to $\lambda$ and its associated eigenvector. We study a previously derived measure of edge importance known as "dynamical importance", which estimates how much $\lambda$ changes when one removes an edge from a graph or adds an edge to it. We examine the accuracy of this estimate for different network structures and compare it to the true change in $\lambda$ after an edge removal or edge addition. We then derive a first-order approximation of the change in the leading eigenvector. We also consider the effects of edge additions on Kuramoto dynamics on networks, and we express the Kuramoto order parameter in terms of dynamical importance. Through our analysis and computational experiments, we find that studying dynamical importance can improve understanding of the relationship between network perturbations and dynamical processes on networks.</description>

      <title>Subexponential lower bounds for $f$-ergodic Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for establishing lower bound on the rate of convergence in $f$-variations of an ergodic Markov processes to its invariant measure. The criterion consists of super and submartingale conditions for certain functionals of the Markov process. Our results complement the existing literature on the stability of Markov processes, based on Lyapunov drift conditions, which primarily focuses on upper bounds. We apply our theory to elliptic diffusions, L\'evy-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and hypoelliptic stochastic Hamiltonian models with known polynomial/stretched exponential upper bounds on their rates of convergence. Our lower bounds match asymptotically the known upper bounds for these classes of models, establishing their rate of convergence to stationarity.</description>

      <title>Stability, bifurcation and spikes of stationary solutions in a chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and logistic source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current paper, we study stability, bifurcation, and spikes of positive stationary solutions of the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and logistic source, \begin{cases} u_t=u_{xx}-\chi (\frac{u}{v} v_x)_x+u(a-b u), &amp; 0&lt;x&lt;L, \, t&gt;0,\cr 0=v_{xx}- \mu v+ \nu u, &amp; 0&lt;x&lt;L, \, t&gt;0 \cr u_x(t,0)=u_x(t,L)=v_x(t,0)=v_x(t,L)=0, &amp; t&gt;0, \tag{1} \end{cases} where $\chi$, $a$, $b$, $\mu$, $\nu$ are positive constants. Among others, we prove there are $\chi^*&gt;0$ and $\{\chi_k^*\}\subset [\chi^*,\infty)$ ($\chi^*\in\{\chi_k^*\}$) such that the constant solution $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{\nu}{\mu}\frac{a}{b})$ of (1) is locally stable when $0&lt;\chi&lt;\chi^*$ and is unstable when $\chi&gt;\chi^*$, and under some generic condition, for each $k\ge 1$, a (local) branch of non-constant stationary solutions of (1) bifurcates from $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{\nu}{\mu}\frac{a}{b})$ when $\chi$ passes through $\chi_k^*$, and global extension of the local bifurcation branch is obtained. We also prove that any sequence of non-constant positive stationary solutions $\{(u(\cdot;\chi_n),v(\cdot;\chi_n))\}$ of (1) with $\chi=\chi_n(\to \infty)$ develops spikes at any $x^*$ satisfying $\liminf_{n\to\infty} u(x^*;\chi_n)&gt;\frac{a}{b}$. Some numerical analysis is carried out. It is observed numerically that the local bifurcation branch bifurcating from $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{\nu}{\mu}\frac{a}{b})$ when $\chi$ passes through $\chi^*$ can be extended to $\chi=\infty$ and the stationary solutions on this global bifurcation extension are locally stable when $\chi\gg 1$ and develop spikes as $\chi\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Structured stability analysis of networked systems with uncertain links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An input-output approach to stability analysis is explored for networked systems with uncertain link dynamics. The main result consists of a collection of integral quadratic constraints, which together imply robust stability of the uncertain networked system, under the assumption that stability is achieved with ideal links. The conditions are decentralized inasmuch as each involves only agent and uncertainty model parameters that are local to a corresponding link. This makes the main result, which imposes no restriction on network structure, suitable for the study of large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Localization for quasi-one-dimensional Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a random family of Dirac operators on $N$ parallel real lines, modelling for example a graphene nanoribbon. We establish a localization criterion involving properties on the group generated by transfer matrices. In particular, we consider not only the case where this group is the symplectic group but also a strict subgroup of it. We establish under quite general hypotheses that the sum of the Lyapunov exponents and the integrated density of states are H\"older continuous. Moreover, for a set of concrete cases where the potentials are on Pauli matrices, we compute the transfer matrices and prove either localization or delocalization, depending on the potential and on the parity of $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11932v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the fundamental results of ergodic optimization asserts that for any dynamical system on a compact metric space with the specification property and for a generic continuous function $f$ every invariant probability measure that maximizes the space average of $f$ must have zero entropy. We establish the analogical result in the context of constraint ergodic optimization, which is introduced by Garibaldi and Lopes (2007).</description>

      <title>Surfaces and other Peano Continua with no Generic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space of chains on a compact connected space encodes all the different ways of continuously growing out of a point until exhausting the space. A chain is generic if its orbit under the action of the underlying homeomorphism group is comeager. In this paper we show that a large family of topological spaces do not have a generic chain: in addition to all manifolds of dimension at least 3, for which the result was already known, our theorem covers all compact surfaces except for the sphere and the real projective plane - for which the question remains open - as well as all other homogeneous Peano continua, circle excluded. If the spaces are moreover strongly locally homogeneous, which is the case for any closed manifold and the Menger curve, we prove that chains cannot be classified up to homeomorphism by countable structures, and that the underlying homomorphism groups have non-metrizable universal minimal flows, in contrast to the case of 1-dimensional manifolds. The proof of the main result is of combinatorial nature, and it relies on the creation of a dictionary between open sets of chains on one side, and walks on finite connected graphs on the other.</description>

      <title>tLaSDI: Thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a latent space dynamics identification method, namely tLaSDI, that embeds the first and second principles of thermodynamics. The latent variables are learned through an autoencoder as a nonlinear dimension reduction model. The latent dynamics are constructed by a neural network-based model that precisely preserves certain structures for the thermodynamic laws through the GENERIC formalism. An abstract error estimate is established, which provides a new loss formulation involving the Jacobian computation of autoencoder. The autoencoder and the latent dynamics are simultaneously trained to minimize the new loss. Computational examples demonstrate the effectiveness of tLaSDI, which exhibits robust generalization ability, even in extrapolation. In addition, an intriguing correlation is empirically observed between a quantity from tLaSDI in the latent space and the behaviors of the full-state solution.</description>
