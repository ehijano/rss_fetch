      <title>The d-electron contribution to the stopping power of transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new non-perturbative model to describe the stopping power by ionization of the $d$-electrons of transition metals. These metals are characterized by the filling of the d-subshell and the promotion of part of the electrons to the conduction band. The contribution of d-electrons at low-impact energies has been noted experimentally in the past as a break of the linear dependence of the stopping power with the ion velocity. In this contribution, we describe the response of these electrons considering the atomic "inhomogeneous" momentum distribution. We focus on the transition metals of Groups 10 and 11 in the periodic table: Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au. Results describe the low energy-stopping power, with good agreement with the experimental data and available TDDFT results. By combining the present non-perturbative model for the $d$-subshell contribution with other approaches for the valence electrons and for the inner shells, we provide a coherent theoretical method capable of describing the stopping power of these transition metals from the very low to the high energy region.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the hyperfine interval for the $2s2p$ $^3\!P_{J}$ state in $^9$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using relativistic multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock method, we calculate the hyperfine-structure properties of the $2s2p$ $^3\!P_{J}$ state in $^9$Be. The hyperfine-structure properties encompass first-order hyperfine-structure parameters, as well as second-order and third-order corrections arising from the hyperfine mixing of different $2s2p$ $^3\!P_{J}$ levels. Based on our theoretical results, we reanalyze the previously reported measurement of the hyperfine interval for the $2s2p$ $^3\!P$ state in $^9$Be [A. G. Blachman and A. Lurio, Phys. Rev. 153, 164(1967)], yielding updated hyperfine-structure constants. Our results show that the hyperfine-structure constant $B$ of $2s2p$ $^3\!P_{1}$ is notably sensitive to second-order correction. Conversely, accurately determining the hyperfine-structure constant $B$ of $2s2p$ $^3\!P_{2}$ necessitates consideration of the hyperfine-structure constant $C$ in the first-order hyperfine interaction equation. The updated hyperfine-structure constant $B$ of the $2s2p$ $^3\!P_{2}$ state is found to be $1.4542(67)$~MHz, which is approximately $1.7\%$ larger than the previous value of $1.427(9)$~MHz.
  By combining our theoretical results with the updated hyperfine-structure constant for the $2s2p$ $^3\!P_{2}$ state, we extract the electric quadrupole moment $Q$ of $^9$Be nucleus to be $0.05320(50)$~b. This value is consistent with the most recent determination using the few-body precision calculation method. Additional, we also discuss the reasons for the discrepancy between the $Q$ values obtained through few-body and previous many-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Making molecules by mergoassociation: the role of center-of-mass motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mergoassociation, two atoms in separate optical traps are combined to form a molecule when the traps are merged. Previous theoretical treatments have considered only the relative motion of the atoms, neglecting coupling to the motion of the center of mass. We develop a theoretical method to include the coupling to center-of-mass motion and consider its consequences for experiments for both weak and strong coupling. We consider the example of RbCs and then extend the treatment to other systems where mergoassociation may be effective, namely RbSr, RbYb and CsYb. We consider the role of the coupling when the traps are anisotropic and the potential use of moveable traps to construct quantum logic gates.</description>

      <title>Compact Blackbody Radiation Atomic Sensor: Measuring Temperature using Optically Excited Atoms in Vapor Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a blackbody radiation thermometer based on optically excited rubidium atoms in a vapor cell. The temperature measurement is fast, with statistical uncertainty as low as 0.1% in one second. We resolve temperature with a precision of 0.04% in the range 308 K to 344 K when averaging for several seconds. Additionally, we describe an extension to this measurement scheme where the device operates as a self-calibrated, or primary, thermometer. We make progress toward realizing a primary thermometer by demonstrating a temperature-dependent self-consistent calibration scheme, with temperature accuracy of order 1% limited by the uncertainty in atomic transition dipole matrix elements.</description>

      <title>A Universal Protocol for Quantum-Enhanced Sensing via Information Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel protocol, which enables Heisenberg-limited quantum-enhanced sensing using the dynamics of any interacting many-body Hamiltonian. Our approach - dubbed butterfly metrology - utilizes a single application of forward and reverse time evolution to produce a coherent superposition of a "scrambled" and "unscrambled" quantum state. In this way, we create metrologically-useful long-range entanglement from generic local quantum interactions. The sensitivity of butterfly metrology is given by a sum of local out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) - the prototypical diagnostic of quantum information scrambling. Our approach broadens the landscape of platforms capable of performing quantum-enhanced metrology; as an example, we provide detailed blueprints and numerical studies demonstrating a route to scalable quantum-enhanced sensing in ensembles of solid-state spin defects.</description>

      <title>Active Stabilization of Laser Diode Injection Using a Polarization-Spectroscopy Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser diode injection-locking is a commonly used method to amplify laser light, while preserving its spectral properties. Fluctuations in the environmental conditions can cause injection-locking to fail, especially when operating with low seed powers or with a swept seed frequency. We present a method inspired by the H\"ansch-Couillaud scheme to monitor and actively stabilize the conditions required for injection-locking a laser diode. Using only a few optical components, our scheme can run continuously in the background and is modulation-free. We demonstrate its efficacy by showing its robustness to large fluctuations in diode temperature, seed frequency and power, effectively extending the reliable operating range and stability over time.</description>

      <title>Production and Loss Processes of Hydrogen Energetic Neutral Atoms in the Heliosphere from 5 eV to 500 keV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations provide valuable insights into the plasma conditions in the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium. Unlike plasma detectors, which measure charged particles tied to the magnetic fields at their location, ENA detectors capture former ions that were neutralized in distant regions and traverse the heliosphere in straight trajectories. ENA fluxes near the Sun represent line-of-sight integrals of parent ion fluxes multiplied by neutralization (production) rates and reduced by the probability of ENA reionization (loss) processes. So far, most ENA analyses have focused on charge exchange between hydrogen atoms and protons as the primary source of ENAs. Here, we examine various ENA production and loss processes throughout the heliosphere in the broad energy range (5 eV to 500 keV) encompassing the next-generation ENA instruments aboard the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission. Our study considers binary collisions involving the most abundant species: protons, electrons, {\alpha}-particles, He+ ions, photons, as well as hydrogen and helium atoms. Our findings indicate that, in addition to ENAs produced by charge exchange of energetic protons with hydrogen atoms, a significant portion of high-energy ENAs originate from the charge exchange with helium atoms. Below 10 keV, the dominant ENA loss processes are charge exchange collisions with protons and photoionization. However, stripping ionization processes, e.g., from collisions with ambient interstellar neutral hydrogen, become the main loss mechanism for higher energies because the charge exchange rate rapidly decreases.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio Approach to Many-Body Quantum Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13190v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental longstanding problem in studying spin models is the efficient and accurate numerical simulation of the long-time behavior of larger systems. The exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the entanglement accumulation at long times pose major challenges for current methods. To address these issues, we employ the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) framework to simulate the many-body spin dynamics of the Heisenberg model in various settings, including the Ising and XYZ limits with different interaction ranges and random couplings. Benchmarks with analytical and exact numerical approaches show that ML-MCTDH accurately captures the time evolution of one- and two-body observables in both one- and two-dimensional lattices. A comparison of ML-MCTDH with the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) demonstrates that our approach excels in handling anisotropic models and consistently provides better results for two-point observables in all simulation instances. Our results indicate that the multilayer structure of ML-MCTDH is a promising numerical framework for handling the dynamics of generic many-body spin systems.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum dependence in multiphoton ionization and attosecond time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond ionization time-delays at photoelectron energies above typically 10 eV are usually interpreted using the so called asymptotic approximation as a sum of the atomic or molecular delays with a universal laser-induced contribution. Here, we employ a two-harmonic RABITT (Reconstruction of Attosecond Beating by Interference of Two-photon Transitions) configuration to isolate the multiphoton pathways and measure the ionization time delays as a function of the dressing field intensity. We show that the validity of the asymptotic theory can be extended to the threshold or to higher-order contributions by rigorously treating the angular-momentum dependence of the continuum-continuum transitions into universal and easily computable partial-wave-specific correction factors. Our asymptotic treatment is also valid for higher-order interfering amplitudes while significantly simplifying their evaluation and providing a transparent physical interpretation. The validity of the method for atomic and molecular targets in the vicinity of resonances, ionization thresholds, and for both the emission-integrated and angularly resolved signal is confirmed by comparison to ab initio calculations over a wide energy range.</description>

      <title>Mixing High Harmonic Generation and X-ray Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the mixing of laser-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) and x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.</description>

Abstract: Ultracold atoms are crucial for unlocking truly precise and accurate quantum metrology, and provide an essential platform for quantum computing, communication and memories. One of the largest ongoing challenges is the miniaturization of these quantum devices. Here, we show that the typically macroscopic optical lattice architecture at the heart of many ultra-precise quantum technologies can be realized with a single input laser beam on the same diffractive chip already used to create the ultracold atoms. Moreover, this inherently ultra-stable platform enables access to a plethora of new lattice dimensionalities and geometries, ideally suited for the design of high-accuracy, portable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Capturing Nonlinear Electron Dynamics with Fully Characterised Attosecond X-ray Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are the key to studying electron dynamics at their natural timescale in specifically targeted electronic states. They promise to build the conceptual bridge between physical and chemical photo-reaction processes. Free-electron lasers (FELs) have demonstrated their capability of generating intense attosecond X-ray pulses. The use of SASE-based FELs for time-resolving experiments and investigations of nonlinear X-ray absorption mechanisms, however, necessitates their full pulse-to-pulse characterisation which remains a cutting-edge challenge. We have characterised X-ray pulses with durations of down to 600 attoseconds and peak powers up to 200 GW at ~1 keV photon energy via angular streaking at the Small Quantum Systems instrument of the European XFEL in Germany. As a direct application, we present results of nonlinear X-ray--matter interaction via time-resolved electron spectroscopy on a transient system, observing single- and double-core-hole generation in neon atoms. Using the derived temporal information about each single X-ray pulse, we reveal an otherwise hidden peak-intensity dependence of the probability for formation of double-core vacancies in neon after primary K-shell ionisation. Our results advance the field of attosecond science with highly intense and fully characterised X-ray pulses to the state-specific investigation of electronic motion in non-stationary media.</description>

      <title>Bringing multilevel quantum master equations into Lindblad form for complete positivity tests: Two approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum master equations (QMEs) are the primary workhorse in quantum information science, quantum optics, spectroscopy, and quantum thermodynamics, bringing an arbitrary $N$-level QME into Lindbladian form and verifying complete positivity of the associated quantum dynamical map remain open challenges for $N\ge 3$. We explore and implement two independent methods to accomplish these tasks, which enable one to directly compute the Kossakowski matrix of an arbitrary Markovian QME from its Liouvillian. In the first method, due to Hall, Cresser, Li, and Andersson, the Kossakowski matrix elements are obtained by evaluating the action of the Liouvillian on the orthonormal SU($N$) basis matrices and then computing a sum of matrix-product traces. The second method, developed in this work, is based on the real $N$-level coherence vector and relies on the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a rectangular matrix composed of the structure constants of SU$(N)$. We show that both methods give identical results, and apply them to establish the complete positivity of the partial secular Bloch-Redfield QME for the $\Lambda$ and V-systems driven by incoherent light. We find that the eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix of these seemingly different three-level systems are identical, implying close similarities of their dissipative dynamics. By facilitating the expression of multilevel Markovian QMEs in Lindblad form, our results enable testing the QMEs for complete positivity without solving them, as well as restoring complete positivity by keeping only non-negative eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix.</description>
