      <title>On minimum Venn diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $n$-Venn diagram is a diagram in the plane consisting of $n$ simple closed curves that intersect only finitely many times such that each of the $2^n$ possible intersections is represented by a single connected region. An $n$-Venn diagram has at most $2^n-2$ crossings, and if this maximum number of crossings is attained, then only two curves intersect in every crossing. To complement this, Bultena and Ruskey considered $n$-Venn diagrams that minimize the number of crossings, which implies that many curves intersect in every crossing. Specifically, they proved that the total number of crossings in any $n$-Venn diagram is at least $L_n:=\lceil\frac{2^n-2}{n-1}\rceil$, and if this lower bound is attained then essentially all $n$ curves intersect in every crossing. Diagrams achieving this bound are called minimum Venn diagrams, and are known only for $n\leq 7$. Bultena and Ruskey conjectured that they exist for all $n\geq 8$. In this work, we establish an asympototic version of their conjecture. For $n=8$ we construct a diagram with 40 crossings, only 3 more than the lower bound $L_8=37$. Furthermore, for every $n$ of the form $n=2^k$ for some integer $k\geq 4$, we construct an $n$-Venn diagram with at most $(1+\frac{33}{8n})L_n=(1+o(1))L_n$ many crossings. Via a doubling trick this also gives $(n+m)$-Venn diagrams for all $0\leq m&lt;n$ with at most $40\cdot 2^m$ crossings for $n=8$ and at most $(1+\frac{33}{8n})\frac{n+m}{n}L_{n+m}=(2+o(1))L_{n+m}$ many crossings for $k\geq 4$. In particular, we obtain $n$-Venn diagrams with the smallest known number of crossings for all $n\geq 8$. Our constructions are based on partitions of the hypercube into isometric paths and cycles, using a result of Ramras.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of freezing automata networks of bounded pathwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An automata network is a graph of entities, each holding a state from a finite set and evolving according to a local update rule which depends only on its neighbors in the network's graph. It is freezing if there is an order on the states such that the state evolution of any node is non-decreasing in any orbit. They are commonly used to model epidemic propagation, diffusion phenomena like bootstrap percolation or cristal growth. Previous works have established that, under the hypothesis that the network graph is of bounded treewidth, many problems that can be captured by trace specifications at individual nodes admit efficient algorithms. In this paper we study the even more restricted case of a network of bounded pathwidth and show two hardness results that somehow illustrate the complexity of freezing dynamics under such a strong graph constraint. First, we show that the trace specification checking problem is NL-complete. Second, we show that deciding first order properties of the orbits augmented with a reachability predicate is NP-hard.</description>

      <title>Enumeration in the lattice of $q$-decreasing words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the poset of $q$-decreasing words equipped with the componentwise order forms a lattice. We enumerate the join-irreducible elements for arbitrary $q&gt;0$, and for any positive rational number $q$, we determine the number of coverings, intervals and meet-irreducible elements. The latter present the same structure as words over an alphabet of $2\lceil q\rceil+1$ letters avoiding $\lceil q\rceil^2+2\lceil q\rceil-1$ consecutive patterns of length 2. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of several of these quantities.</description>

      <title>Decision problems on geometric tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study decision problems on geometric tilings. First, we study a variant of the Domino problem where square tiles are replaced by geometric tiles of arbitrary shape. We show that this variant is undecidable regardless of the shapes, extending previous results on rhombus tiles. This result holds even when the geometric tiling is forced to belong to a fixed set. Second, we consider the problem of deciding whether a geometric subshift has finite local complexity, which is a common assumption when studying geometric tilings. We show that this problem is undecidable even in a simple setting (square shapes with small modifications).</description>

      <title>Aperiodic monotiles: from geometry to groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2023, two striking, nearly simultaneous, mathematical discoveries have excited their respective communities, one by Greenfeld and Tao, the other (the Hat tile) by Smith, Myers, Kaplan and Goodman-Strauss, which can both be summed up as the following: there exists a single tile that tiles, but not periodically (sometimes dubbed the einstein problem). The two settings and the tools are quite different (as emphasized by their almost disjoint bibliographies): one in euclidean geometry, the other in group theory. Both are highly nontrivial: in the first case, one allows complex shapes; in the second one, also the space to tile may be complex. We propose here a framework that embeds both of these problems. From any tile system in this general framework, with some natural additional conditions, we exhibit a construction to simulate it by a group-theoretical tiling. We illustrate our setting by transforming the Hat tile into a new aperiodic group monotile, and we describe the symmetries of both the geometrical Hat tilings and the group tilings we obtain.</description>

      <title>The Integrality Gap of the Traveling Salesman Problem is $4/3$ if the LP Solution Has at Most $n+6$ Non-zero Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the classical Dantzig - Fulkerson - Johnson formulation of the symmetric metric Traveling Salesman Problem and study the integrality gap of its linear relaxation, namely the Subtour Elimination Problem (SEP). This integrality gap is conjectured to be 4/3. We prove that, when solving a problem on n nodes, if the optimal SEP solution has at most n + 6 non-zero components, then the conjecture is true. To establish this result, we devise a new methodology that combines theoretical analysis and computational verification.</description>

      <title>Erd\H os--Ko--Rado type results for partitions via spread approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address several Erd\H os--Ko--Rado type questions for families of partitions. Two partitions of $[n]$ are {\it $t$-intersecting} if they share at least $t$ parts, and are {\it partially $t$-intersecting} if some of their parts intersect in at least $t$ elements. The question of what is the largest family of pairwise $t$-intersecting partitions was studied for several classes of partitions: Peter Erd\H os and Sz\'ekely studied partitions of $[n]$ into $\ell$ parts of unrestricted size; Ku and Renshaw studied unrestricted partitions of $[n]$; Meagher and Moura, and then Godsil and Meagher studied partitions into $\ell$ parts of equal size. We improve and generalize the results proved by these authors. Meagher and Moura, following the work of Erd\H os and Sz\'ekely, introduced the notion of partially $t$-intersecting partitions, and conjectured, what should be the largest partially $t$-intersecting family of partitions into $\ell$ parts of equal size $k$. The main result of this paper is the proof of their conjecture for all $t, k$, provided $\ell$ is sufficiently large. All our results are applications of the spread approximation technique, introduced by Zakharov and the author. In order to use it, we need to refine some of the theorems from the original paper. As a byproduct, this makes the present paper a self-contained presentation of the spread approximation technique for $t$-intersecting problems.</description>

      <title>Causal Graph Dynamics and Kan Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the one side, the formalism of Global Transformations comes with the claim of capturing any transformation of space that is local, synchronous and deterministic. The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling. The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones. On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled. In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well. This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics. Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with covering number $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A covering number of a family is the size of the smallest set that intersects all sets from the family. In 1978 Frankl determined for $n\ge n_0(k)$ the largest intersecting family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ with covering number $3$. In this paper, we essentially settle this problem, showing that the same family is extremal for any $k\ge 100$ and $n&gt;2k$.</description>
