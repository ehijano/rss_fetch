      <title>Propagating Gravitational Waves in Teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves offer a key insight into the viability of classes of gravitational theories beyond general relativity. The observational constraints on their speed of propagation can provide strong constraints on generalized classes of broader gravitational frameworks. In this work, we reconsider the general class of Gauss-Bonnet theories in the context of teleparallel gravity, where the background geometry is expressed through torsion. We perform tensor perturbations on a flat FLRW background, and derive the gravitational wave propagation equation. We find that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light in these classes of theories. We also derive the distance-duality relationship for radiation propagating in the gravitational wave and electromagnetic domains.</description>

      <title>Constraining a $f(R, L_m)$ Gravity Cosmological Model with Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a spatially flat FLRW cosmological model within modified gravity, defined by the function \( f(R, L_m) = \alpha R + L_m^\beta + \gamma \), where \( L_m \) is the matter Lagrangian density. The resulting Friedmann equations yield the Hubble parameter: \[ H(z) = H_0 \sqrt{(1 - \lambda) + \lambda (1 + z)^{3(1 + w)}}, \] with \( \lambda = \frac{\gamma}{6\alpha H_0^2} + 1 \) and \( w = \frac{\beta(n - 2) + 1}{2\beta - 1} \). The parameter \( n \), linked to the equation of state \( p = (1 - n)\rho \), allows the model to account for different cosmological epochs.
  Using a Bayesian MCMC method, we constrain the model parameters with data from cosmic chronometers, the Pantheon+ Supernovae sample, BAO, and CMB shift parameters. The best-fit values obtained are \( H_0 = 72.773^{+0.148}_{-0.152} \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \lambda = 0.289^{+0.007}_{-0.007} \), and \( w = -0.002^{+0.002}_{-0.002} \), all at the 1\(\sigma\) confidence level.
  The model predicts a transition redshift \( z_t \approx 0.76 \) for the onset of acceleration and an estimated universe age of 13.21 Gyr. The relatively higher value of \( H_0 \) compared to Planck 2018 suggests a possible resolution to the Hubble tension. Assuming \( \rho_0 = 0.534 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{g/cm}^3 \) and \( n = 1 \), the constants are found to be \( \beta = 1.00201 \), \( \alpha = 512247 \), and \( \gamma = -1.215 \times 10^{-29} \).
  We also compute the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to compare this model to the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM. A small BIC difference (\( \Delta \text{BIC} = 0.16 \)) indicates similar statistical support. Thus, the \( f(R, L_m) \) model stands as a consistent and viable alternative to \(\Lambda\)CDM, offering insights into late-time cosmology.</description>

      <title>Frequency contamination from new fundamental fields in black hole ringdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the modelling of black hole ringdown beyond General Relativity (GR), emphasizing the limitations of approaches that rely solely on shifted quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies. Starting from modified Teukolsky equations in such scenarios, we classify the distinct types of deviations that can arise -- those shifting QNM frequencies, and those introducing additional frequencies associated with extra fields. We then construct the most general ansatz for metric perturbations in this context and discuss its implications for QNM modelling and theory-agnostic tests of GR using gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Myrzakulov Gravity from $R + F(T, G)$: Numerical Insights and Torsion-Gauss-Bonnet Dynamics in Weitzenb\"ock Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of modified gravity models has garnered significant attention because of their potential to provide alternative explanations for cosmological phenomena, such as the accelerated expansion of the universe and the nature of dark energy. One such model, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Myrzakulov $R + F(T, G)$ gravity (EGBMG), which incorporates the curvature $R$, torsion $T$, and the Gauss-Bonnet term $G$, offers a promising framework to explore the dynamics of the universe and its evolution. This paper delves into the theoretical and observational implications of the EGBMG model, focusing on its ability to address long-standing challenges in cosmology, including the evolution of dark energy and the transition from early-time inflationary behavior to late-time acceleration. We review recent advancements in the model, including its compatibility with observational data and its ability to provide new insights into cosmic acceleration. Through a combination of theoretical models, dynamical systems analysis, and cosmological diagnostics, we demonstrate the robustness of the EGBMG framework in explaining the large-scale structure of the universe and its accelerated expansion. This paper serves as a step toward further exploring the potential of this model to understand the fundamental forces driving Weitzenb$\"{o}$ck spacetime.</description>

      <title>A neural network for estimating compact binary coalescence parameters of gravitational-wave events in real time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-latency pipelines analyzing gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence events rely on matched filter techniques. Limitations in template banks and waveform modeling, as well as nonstationary detector noise cause errors in signal parameter recovery, especially for events with high chirp masses. We present a quantile regression neural network model that provides dynamic bounds on key parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, and total mass. We test the model on various synthetic datasets and real events from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave transient catalogs. We find that the model accuracy is consistently over 90% across all the datasets. We explore the possibility of employing the neural network bounds as priors in online parameter estimation. We find that they reduce by 9% the number of likelihood evaluations. This approach may shorten parameter estimation run times without affecting sky localizations.</description>

      <title>Statistical identification of ringdown modes with rational filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring quasinormal modes (QNMs) during the ringdown phase of binary black hole coalescences provides key insights into merger dynamics and enables tests of the no-hair theorem. The QNM rational filter has recently been introduced as a technique to identify specific QNMs in ringdown signals without sampling over mode amplitudes and phases. In this work, we extend the QNM rational filter framework to quantify the statistical confidence of subdominant mode detections in real gravitational wave (GW) observations. We employ a frequentist approach to estimate false-alarm probabilities and propose a workflow for robust identification of specific QNMs. We first validate our methodology using synthetic signals generated from numerical relativity waveforms. We then reanalyze the first GW event, GW150914, finding a marginal detection of an overtone, but at time when the applicability of constant amplitude QNM fits is not fully understood. This extended methodology provides a systematic approach to improving the reliability of QNM detections, paving the way for more precise tests of strong-field gravity with current and future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Geodesics and scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild black holes embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo with quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis into a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo with a quintessential field. We develop the composite spacetime metric and examine its geometric properties, including horizon structure and curvature invariants. Our findings reveal that increasing both the DM core density $\rho_{s}$ and quintessence parameter $c$ leads to an expansion of the event horizon and a reduction in the size of the cosmological horizon. We then investigate the dynamics of timelike and null geodesics, focusing on the determination of innermost stable circular orbits, photon sphere radii, and black hole shadow features. Thereafter, using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate the weak deflection angles, demonstrating that lensing effects are enhanced with increasing halo density and radius. Scalar perturbations are examined using the sixth-order WKB method and Pad\'{e} approximants, highlighting suppressed quasinormal mode frequencies as DM density rises. Greybody factors and Hawking radiation sparsity are also explored, showing increased transmission coefficients for larger halos and deviations from standard blackbody behavior. These results underscore the significant influence of DM and quintessence on black hole observables, offering testable predictions for astrophysical probes such as Event Horizon Telescope imaging and gravitational wave spectroscopy. Scalar perturbations are analyzed using the 6th-order WKB method, demonstrating that quasinormal mode frequencies are suppressed as the DM density increases. We also explore greybody factors and the sparsity of Hawking radiation, showing increased transmission coefficients for larger halos and deviations from standard blackbody behavior.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational waves with light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong evidence for low-frequency gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), published in 2023, has widened the scope for teaching about gravitational wave astronomy. This article provides a simple, unified overview of the detection of gravitational waves using light waves that encompasses the recent PTA detections, the by-now classic interferometric detections using LIGO and similar detectors, and the yet-to-be-accomplished detections using long-arm detectors like the spaceborne LISA. The presentation is at a level accessible for undergraduate students. The influence of gravitational waves on light is derived in a way that makes use only of basic gravitational wave properties and Einstein's equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>Tests of General Relativity with GW230529: a neutron star merging with a lower mass-gap compact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed tests of General Relativity on gravitational wave signal GW230529_181500, which comes from what is most likely a neutrons star merging with a black hole in the lower mass gap. We used two different frameworks to perform parameterized inspiral tests. We find that the signal is consistent with General Relativity for all deviation parameters and we obtain particularly tight constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss some challenges that arise when analyzing this signal, namely biases due to correlations with tidal effects and the degeneracy between the deviation parameter at Newtonian order and the chirp mass. We also performed a theory-specific test for Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity where we obtain the best constraints on this theory to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the parameterized post-Maxwellian vacuum electrodynamics, the propagation of an X-ray or
  gamma-ray pulse
  through the electromagnetic field of a relativistically rotating pulsar is studied.
  Expressions are obtained for the trajectory of this pulse and the law The effect of electromagnetic radiation birefringence in the
  field of a relativistically rotating pulsar or magnetar within the framework of vacuum nonlinear electrodynamicsof its motion from
  the point ${\bf r}_s=\{x_s,y_s,z_s\},$
  where an X-ray or gamma-ray burst occurs at time $t=t_s$ to the point ${\bf r}_d=\{x_s,y_s,z_d\},$ where the detector of this
  radiation is located.
  In the case when the post-Maxwellian parameters of the theory differ, $\eta_1\neq\eta_2$, the time of nonlinear electrodynamic

      <title>A Novel Search Technique for Low-Frequency Periodic Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the advantages of a recently proposed data processing technique to search for continuous gravitational wave (GW) signals from isolated rotating asymmetric neutron stars in data measured by ground-based GW interferometers. This technique relies on the symmetry of the motion around the Sun of an Earth-bound gravitational wave interferometer. By multiplying the measured data time series with a half-year time-shifted copy of it, we obtain two advantages: (i) the main Doppler phase modulation of a monochromatic gravitational wave signal is exactly removed, and (ii) the signal in the product data are located at twice the GW signal frequency. The first significantly reduces the size of the signal's parameter space over which a search is to be performed. The second is advantageous at low frequencies; we find that, with currently available computer processing speeds, this technique is capable of achieving sensitivity that is comparable to or even better than coherent and other possibly non-coherent methods. Further, since our proposed method is implemented over a year-long data segment, it requires processing time comparable to the data acquisition time of currently available computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fourth observing run (O4) of Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA has started in May 2023 and is planned to continue until October 2025. On behalf of the LVK Collaboration, I will cover two topics: Status of the O4 run and latest non-CBC results. Status of the O4 run. The focus will be on detectors' performance and online searches/alerts, drawing on publicly available sources provided by the collaboration. Additionally, I will give an overview of removing noise techniques, including AI approaches that help gain sensitivity at a small cost. Latest non-CBC results. Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) is just one of the potential GW sources: Continuous Waves, Bursts, and Stochastic are still being hunted down. Here, O4 public results of searches will be presented, or the latest O3 will be discussed when the former are not yet available. So far, no GW detections have been associated with these non-CBC sources in any of the searches conducted.</description>

      <title>Non-covariant parabolic theories of relativistic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new first-order theory of relativistic dissipation has been recently proposed, where viscous effects are incorporated using the traditional Navier-Stokes framework. Its main novelty is the avoidance of dynamical instabilities by allowing different observers to use equations that are not related by exact Lorentz transformations. In this work, we explore the implications of this non-covariance in depth. In particular, we discuss how predictions differ between observers moving at nearly luminal speeds relative to each other. We find that all disagreements stem from the relativity of simultaneity, which introduces frame-dependent anisotropic delays in the diffusive process. These anisotropies significantly limit the applicability of the equation used by observers who move very fast relative to the medium. However, the magnitude of the related error remains finite at infinite Lorentz factors, meaning that it is possible to find a regime where all observers agree on the outcome of experiments.</description>

      <title>A "Neural" Riemann solver for Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach to solving the Riemann problem in one-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics, where the most computationally expensive steps of the exact solver are replaced by compact, highly specialized neural networks. The resulting "neural" Riemann solver is integrated into a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme and tested on a range of canonical problems, demonstrating both robustness and efficiency. By constraining the learned components to the root-finding of single-valued functions, the method retains physical interpretability while significantly accelerating the computation. The solver is shown to achieve accuracies comparable to the exact algorithm at a fraction of the cost, suggesting that this approach may offer a viable path toward more efficient Riemann solvers for use in large-scale numerical relativity simulations of astrophysical systems.</description>

Abstract: We explore the weak-field phenomenology of a compact star spacetime modified by quantum gravitational corrections derived from the effective field theoretical (EFT) approach by Calmet et al. [1]. These corrections, encoded in non-local curvature-squared terms, distinguish matter-supported geometries from vacuum solutions by contributing nontrivial modifications at second order in G. Using the corrected metric, we analytically derive expressions for the deflection of light and time-like particles via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We further compute the perihelion advance of Mercury, Shapiro time delay, and gravitational redshift within this framework. Each classical observable acquires quantum corrections that, though exceedingly small represent potential imprints of quantum gravity. The Shapiro delay and redshift likewise exhibit finite, source-dependent deviations from their general relativistic predictions due to the modified temporal metric component. While current observational capabilities remain insufficient to detect these minute effects, the analysis demonstrates that quantum gravitational signatures are embedded even in weak-field observables. Last, we study massless scalar perturbations in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes by analyzing their quasinormal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors using the WKB method and Pade resummation. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the coupling parameter enhances spacetime stability and significantly influences emission spectra through frequency-dependent transparency. Moreover, the results underscore that quantum-corrected star metrics yield phenomenological distinctions from classical black holes, particularly near the Planck scale, where vacuum solutions lose validity.</description>

      <title>A directed continuous-wave search from neutron stars in binary systems with the five-vector resampling technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational-wave signals (CWs), which are typically emitted by rapidly rotating neutron stars with non-axisymmetric deformations, represent particularly intriguing targets for the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors. These detectors operate within sensitivity bands that encompass more than half of the known pulsars in our galaxy existing in binary systems, which are the targeted sources of this paper. However, the detection of these faint signals is especially challenged by the Doppler modulation due to the source's orbital motion, typically described by five Keplerian parameters, which must be determined with high precision to effectively detect the signal. This modulation spreads the signal across multiple frequency bins, resulting in a notable reduction of signal-to-noise ratio and potentially hindering signal detection. To overcome this issue, a robust five-vector resampling data-analysis algorithm has been developed to conduct thorough directed/narrowband CW searches at an affordable computational cost. We employ this methodology for the first time to search for CWs from Scorpius X-1, using publicly available data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors. No statistically significant CW signals can be claimed. Hence, we proceeded setting 95% confidence-level upper limits in selected frequency bands and orbital parameter ranges, while also evaluating overall sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Extending the micro-Hertz detection horizons via hidden orbital resonance effect for geocentric gravitational wave antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microhertz gravitational wave (GW) band (0.1 $\mu$Hz-0.1 mHz) holds critical insights into coalescing supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) and the stochastic GW background, yet remains observationally inaccessible due to technical barriers. This work presents a strategy to unlock this band by exploiting orbital resonance effects in the proposed geocentric GW antennas, circumventing the need for impractical ultralong baselines or advanced technologies. We demonstrate that when GW frequencies resonate with integer multiples of a satellite's orbital frequency (e.g., 1$\times$, 3$\times$), sustained orbital deviations amplify signals through time-cumulative effects. Benifit from orbital modulation and resonance phenomena, detector sensitivity can be enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the microhertz regime. For proposed missions like TianQin, gLISA, and GADFLI, this resonance-driven mechanism extends detectable GW frequencies and expands the observable parameter space of SMBHBs to lower masses and higher redshifts, exceeding conventional sensitivity assessments. This approach may leverage geocentric missions as cost-effective platforms to bridge the microhertz observational gap.</description>

      <title>Highly-accurate neutron star modeling in the Hartle-Thorne Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future X-ray missions, such as NICER and LOFT, together with gravitational-wave observations from ground-based detectors, will provide new insights into neutron stars. Interpreting accurate observations in the future will require accurate models of their gravitational fields. In this first paper of a two-part series, we construct the perturbation equations for slowly-rotating, isolated, and unmagnetized neutron stars, extending the Hartle-Thorne approximation to seventh order in a slow-rotation expansion. We obtain exact, closed-form, analytical solutions for the exterior metric at each order in spin. From these solutions, we derive expressions for the mass and mass-current scalar multipole moments, $M_{\ell}$ and $S_{\ell}$, respectively, up to seventh order in spin frequency, using two distinct methods. This high-order expansion allows us to calculate second-, fourth-, and sixth-order relative spin corrections to the observed mass and moment of inertia; second- and fourth-order relative spin corrections to the quadrupole and octopole moments; second-order relative spin corrections to the hexadecapole and dotriacontapole moments; and leading-order-in-spin expressions for the hexacontatetrapole and hectoicosaoctapole moments. Going to seventh order in the spin-frequency approximation will enable very precise calculations of X-ray pulse profiles, as well as the I-Love-Q and three-hair relations for slowly-rotating neutron stars. These results will be valuable for breaking parameter degeneracies in future multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum parameter-mass induced scalarization of qOS-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain quantum parameter ($\alpha$)-mass ($M$) induced spontaneous scalarization of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS)-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the unknown qOS action.
  We derive Smarr formula which describes a correct thermodynamics for the bald qOS-black hole.
  It is turned out that two Davies points of heat capacity are identified with two critical onset mass and quantum parameter for spontaneous scalarization.
  Furthermore, the shadow radius analysis of qOS-black hole is performed to distinguish quantum parameter from mass by comparing them with the EHT observation.
  There is no constraints on the quantum parameter, but new constraints are found for the mass.
  This work is considered as the first example to show a close connection between thermodynamics of bald black hole and spontaneous scalarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Krein space quantization and the ambient space formalism have been successfully applied to address challenges in quantum geometry (e.g., quantum gravity) and the axiomatic formulation of quantum Yang-Mills theory, including phenomena such as color confinement and the mass gap. Building on these advancements, we aim to extend these methods to develop novel quantum algorithms for quantum computation, particularly targeting underdetermined or ill-conditioned linear systems of equations, as well as quantum systems characterized by non-unitary evolution and open quantum dynamics. This approach represents a significant step beyond commonly used techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Decomposition, Sz.-Nagy dilation, and Unitary Operator Decomposition. The proposed algorithm has the potential to establish a unified framework for quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Greybody factors as robust gravitational observables: insights into post-merger signals and echoes from ultracompact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum plays a central role in modeling the post-merger ringdown phase of binary coalescences of compact objects. However, its interpretation is subject to certain ambiguities. Motivated by a recently discovered connection between greybody factors and post-merger black hole signals, we investigate the robustness of greybody factors as gravitational observables, offering a complementary perspective to quasinormal mode analysis. We show that greybody factors are stable under small perturbations and are not affected by the specific ambiguities that limit the reliability of quasinormal modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that greybody factors are equally relevant for characterizing the signals emitted by wormholes and other horizonless ultracompact objects, providing a natural explanation for the echoes observed in the time-domain response of such object.</description>

      <title>Alternative Derivations of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the original derivation of Hawking radiation, there have been lots of alternative approaches to show the same fact that black holes emit particles as hot bodies with a temperature. These alternative methods generally rely on different conditions and physical quantities to manifest the radiation, providing various points of view of this effect in the intersection of gravity and quantum theory. This chapter presents some alternative derivations of Hawking radiation in the literature, including the tunneling, anomaly and Green's function methods. From these methods, various features of the black hole system can be seen, such as the gravitational and trace anomalies of the $(1+1)$-dimensional effective theory and the analytical continuation of the complexified spacetime.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Tidal Dissipation Numbers of Non-rotating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of tidal dissipation numbers (TDNs) quantifies the absorption of the tidal force exerted by a companion during an inspiralling phase of a binary compact object. This tidal dissipation generally affects the gravitational waveform, and measuring the TDNs of a black hole (BH) allows us to test the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we develop a parametrized formalism for calculating the TDNs of static and spherically symmetric BH backgrounds using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method, which connects the underlying perturbative equations with observable quantities in gravitational-wave observations in a theory-agnostic manner. Our formalism applies to any system where the master equation has the form of the Regge-Wheeler/Zerilli equation with a small correction to the effective potential. As an application of our formalism, we consider three examples: the effective field theory of BH perturbations with timelike scalar profile, the Einstein-Maxwell system, and a higher-curvature extension of general relativity. We also discuss the absence of logarithmic running for the TDNs.</description>

      <title>Generic effective source for gravitational self-force calculations in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical calculation of gravitational self-force in extreme mass ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs) is fundamentally challenging due to the singular nature of point-particle sources. This singularity arises from the interaction between the smaller compact object and its own gravitational perturbation. To address these challenges, the effective source method offers an innovative approach. It replaces traditional regularization schemes with a reformulation of the problem, utilizing finite and physically meaningful effective sources that inherently incorporate renormalized quantities. This paper presents an analytic framework for constructing finite and continuous effective sources for massive point particles undergoing arbitrary geodesic motion in Schwarzschild spacetime. This represents the first fully analytic treatment of such sources for generic geodesic trajectories. The complete analytic expression for effective sources establishes a critical foundation for computing both self-consistent and second-order gravitational self-forces, thereby enabling accurate waveform modeling of EMRIs in gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) originating from cosmological sources offer direct insights into the physics of the primordial Universe, the fundamental nature of gravity, and the cosmic expansion of the Universe. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive overview of our recent advances in GW cosmology, supported by the national key research and development program of China, focusing on cosmological GW sources and their implications for fundamental physics and cosmology. We first discuss the generation mechanisms and characteristics of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds generated by physical processes occurred in the early Universe, including those from inflation, phase transitions, and topological defects, and summarize current and possible future constraints from pulsar timing array and space-based detectors. Next, we explore the formation and observational prospects of primordial black holes as GW sources and their potential connection to dark matter. We then analyze how GWs are affected by large-scale structure, cosmological perturbations, and possible modifications of gravity on GW propagation, and how these effects can be used to test fundamental symmetry of gravity. Finally, we discuss the application of GW standard sirens in measuring the Hubble constant, the expansion history, and dark energy parameters, including their combination with electromagnetic observations. These topics together show how GW observations, especially with upcoming space-based detectors, such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin, can provide new information about the physics of the early Universe, cosmological evolution, and the nature of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instrumental artefacts, such as glitches, can significantly compromise the scientific output of LISA. Our methodology employs advanced Bayesian techniques, including Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo and parallel tempering to find and characterize glitches and astrophysical signals. The robustness of the pipeline is demonstrated through its ability to simultaneously handle diverse glitch morphologies and it is validated with a 'Spritz'-type data set from the LISA Data Challenge. Our approach enables accurate inference on Massive Black Hole Binaries, while simultaneously characterizing both instrumental artefacts and noise. These results present a significant development in strategies for differentiating between instrumental noise and astrophysical signals, which will ultimately improve the accuracy and reliability of source population analyses with LISA.</description>

      <title>Light propagation in the 2PN approximation in the monopole and quadrupole field of a body at rest: Supplement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent investigation [1], the propagation of a light signal in the gravitational field of a body at rest has been determined in the second post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation. In order to integrate the geodesic equations for the light rays, the individual terms have been separated into time-dependent scalar functions and time-independent tensorial coefficients. In this way one can reduce the integration of these scalar functions to only eight master integrals, which can be solved in closed form. On the other side, this procedure leads to tensorial coefficients, which contain linearly dependent tensors. For subsequent investigations it is more appropriate, to rearrange these tensorial terms into a new form, where these tensorial coefficients contain only tensors which are linearly independent of each other. This rearranged form of the solution will be represented in this investigation. This new form for the light trajectory is the basis for our recent investigations in astrometry on the sub-microarcsecond level of accuracy in [2].</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we present a novel analytical Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) solution that exhibits a static BH with a dark matter (DM) halo characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile. We study the properties of the newly derived BH solution by examining its spacetime curvature characteristics and energy conditions, providing insights into how the DM halo influences these fundamental characteristics. This solution could represent an alternative perspective on the interaction of black hole-dark matter systems, providing new insights into the fundamental properties of DM halos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct static, spherically symmetric, charged traversable wormhole solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell equations, supported by bidirectional (ingoing and outgoing) null dust with negative energy, and discuss a scenario for their dynamical formation from a black hole. Our solution contains a traversable throat, where the areal radius takes a minimum, although the spacetime is not asymptotically flat. In our formation scenario, the spacetime evolves sequentially from a black hole to Vaidya regions and finally to a wormhole, with each transition mediated by an impulsive null shell. We find that the radius of the wormhole throat is determined by the initial mass, spin of the initial black hole and the energy of the shell.</description>

      <title>Shadows and Observational Images of a Schwarzschild-like Black Hole Surrounded by a Dehnen-type Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo, with a focus on how the DM halo's density $\rho_{s}$ and radius $r_{s}$ influence the BH's shadow and photon ring. First, the radius $r_h$ of the BH's event horizon and the equation of motion for photons were derived, and observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for M87* were used to constrain the parameters $\rho_{s}$ and $r_{s}$ of the DM halo. Afterward, by varying the values of $\rho_{s}$ and $r_{s}$, key parameters such as the effective potential $V_{eff}$ of photons, the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$, the radius $r_{isco}$ of the innermost stable circular orbit,and the the radius $r_{ph}$ of the photon sphere were calculated for each case. It was found that as $\rho_{s}$ and $r_{s}$ increase, the above mentioned parameters all show an increasing trend. Subsequently, we examined the optical appearance of the BH under two models: one with an optically and geometrically thin accretion disk and the other with a static spherical accretion model. The findings indicate that as $\rho_{s}$ and $r_{s}$ increase, the peak of the received intensity shifts toward a higher impact parameter $b$, resulting in a distinct optical appearance.</description>

      <title>On the Possibility of the Existence of Wormholes in Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: So far, many exotic predictions of Einstein's equations have been corroborated, with one exception: wormholes (WHs). In this work, we analyze an exact solution to the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton or Phantom equations representing rotating WHs. We introduce a ring singularity that, like other solutions, satisfies Wormhole Cosmic Censorship, i.e., the singularity is causally disconnected. We show that this WH is traversable through the poles, where tidal forces and the magnetic field are reasonably small. We satisfy the energy conditions for the dilaton-like solution. We argue that if dilaton-like interactions can exist in nature, for example, if extra dimensions exist as in superstring theory, WHs are a natural realistic prediction of Einstein's equations, and we should be able to observe them somehow, probably as black hole mimics. We give some examples of realistic WHs that could be observed in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the difference between the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}$ attributed to the Hawking radiation from the de Sitter cosmological horizon and the twice as high local temperature of the de Sitter state, $T=H/\pi=2T_{\rm GH}$, has been discussed by Hughes and Kusmartsev from the topological point of view (see arXiv:2505.05814). According to their approach, this difference is determined by the Euler characteristic $\chi({\cal M})$ of the considered spacetime with Euclidean time. The invariant $\chi({\cal M})$ is different for the global spacetime ${\cal M}=S^4$ and for the manifold limited to a region near the horizon, ${\cal M}=D^2\times S^2$. Here we consider the application of the topological approach to Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black holes with two horizons. Both the outer and inner horizons are characterized by their near-horizon topology, which determines the corresponding horizon temperatures. As a result of the correlation between the horizons, the entropy of the RN black hole is independent of its electric charge, being completely determined by the mass of the black hole. This demonstrates the applicability of the topological approach to the multi-horizon systems.</description>

      <title>The isotropy, anisotropies and non-Gaussianity of the scalar-induced gravitational-wave background: diagrammatic approach for primordial non-Gaussianity up to any order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) produced nonlinearly by the enhanced cosmological curvature perturbations can serve as a potentially powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in the early Universe. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the imprints of local-type PNG on the SIGW background beyond the widely used quadratic and cubic approximations. We develop a diagrammatic approach capable of analyzing SIGWs for PNG up to any order. Utilizing this approach, we derive semi-analytic formulas for the energy-density fraction spectrum of the isotropic background, the angular power spectrum of the energy-density anisotropies, as well as the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of the energy-density non-Gaussianity. Specializing to PNG up to quartic approximation (parameterized by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, $g_\mathrm{NL}$, and $h_\mathrm{NL}$), we numerically compute all contributions to these SIGW spectra. We find that PNG can significantly alter the amplitude of the energy-density spectrum and generate substantial anisotropies through the initial inhomogeneities. Furthermore, we observe that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum always vanish when the primordial curvature perturbations are Gaussian; otherwise, they do not, indicating their potential utility as probes of PNG. Therefore, we anticipate that both the isotropic background and the anisotropies of the SIGW background will provide essential information about the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Graviweak Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graviweak theory seeks to unify gravity (specifically in its self-dual formulation) with the weak interaction, preying on their parallel chiral $SU(2)$ structures. In this paper we further this idea by folding it with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We do this first with a standard Higgs field and potential, starting with a unifying parity-invariant theory which splits into the usual gravity and weak sector under spontaneous symmetry breaking. By rewriting the theory in the two-spin framework we are then prompted to discuss generalizations, within the generic approach known as MacDowell-Mansouri theories where a larger internal gauge group is broken. One of the predictions of the ensuing construction is a non-minimal coupling in the low energy broken phase between curvature and the weak gauge fields, translating at the quantum level to a direct channel between the graviton and the weak bosons.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics with Compact Objects: An Indian Perspective, Present Status and Future Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects, viz., white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes, are the remnants of stellar deaths at the end of their life cycles. They are ideal testbeds for various fundamental physical processes under extreme conditions that are unique in nature. Observational radio astronomy with uGMRT and OORT facilities has led to several important breakthroughs in studies of different kinds of pulsars and their emission mechanisms. On the other hand, accretion processes around compact objects are at the core of Indian astronomy research. In this context, AstroSat mission revolutionized spectro-temporal observations and measurements of accretion phenomena, quasi-periodic oscillations, and jet behaviour in binary systems hosting compact objects. Moreover, recently launched XPoSat mission is set to provide an impetus to these high-energy phenomena around compact objects by enabling us to conduct polarization measurements in the X-ray band. Further, during the past decade, numerous gravitational wave signals have been observed from coalescing black holes and neutron stars in binary systems. Recent simultaneous observation of the GW170817 event in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic channels has ushered in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. In the future, synergistic efforts among several world-class observational facilities, e.g., LIGO-India, SKA, TMT, etc., within the Indian astrophysics community will provide a significant boost to achieve several key science goals that have been delineated here. In general, this article plans to highlight scientific projects being pursued across Indian institutions in this field, the scientific challenges that this community would be focusing on, and the opportunities in the coming decade. Finally, we have also mentioned the required resources, both in the form of infrastructural and human resources.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolutions in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Galaxies: Conduction Fluid Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new two-fluid conduction scheme to simulate the evolution of an isolated, self-gravitating, equilibrium cluster of stars and collisionless dark matter on secular (gravothermal) timescales. We integrate the equations in Lagrangian coordinates via a second-order, semi-implicit algorithm, which is unconditionally stable when the mass of the lighter species is much less than that of the heavier species. The method can be straightforwardly generalized to handle a multi-species system with a population of stars or components beyond collisionless dark matter and stars. We apply the method to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar-dark matter systems, exploring the consequences of mass segregation and gravothermal core collapse, and assessing those effects for observed globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy at Late Time $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift. We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 + \frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift, transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$. Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.</description>

      <title>On the Pipeline Dependence of DESI Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the flat $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the flat $\Lambda$CDM Model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 &lt; 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling+BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 &lt; 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analyses highlight the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.</description>

      <title>Testing cosmological principle under Copernican principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational analyses have revealed potential evidence for a preferred spatial direction in cosmological data. Such directional parameterization inherently places observers at a privileged spatial position, thereby conflicting with the Copernican principle and suffering from the look-elsewhere effect. To restore the Copernican principle which is the foundation of modern astronomy, we propose a stochastic framework for cosmological principle violations. The almost uniform temperature of cosmic microwave background suggests that the deviation of isotropy is negligible ($\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface, which can be used as a zero boundary condition to construct an orthogonal basis below the redshift of recombination. The relative deviation from Hubble diagram of isotropic ($\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) models is expanded with the orthogonal basis with a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Using this new approach, we test cosmological principle with type Ia supernovae, strong lens time delay, and gravitational-wave standard siren. The data sets are consistent with statistical isotropy on large scales.</description>

      <title>Geometric Determinations Of Characteristic Redshifts From DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR Observations: Hints For New Expansion Rate Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a model-agnostic reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history by combining DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR data, with a focus on geometric determination of characteristic redshifts where notable tensions in the expansion rate are found to emerge. Employing Gaussian process regression alongside knot-based spline techniques, we reconstruct cosmic distances and their derivatives to pinpoint these characteristic redshifts and infer $E(z)$. Our analysis reveals significant deviations of approximately 4 to 5$\sigma$ from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust late-time departures that could signal new physics beyond the standard cosmological framework. The joint use of BAO and SN probes enhances the precision of our constraints, allowing us to isolate these deviations without reliance on specific cosmological assumptions. Our findings underscore the role of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO, Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and help distinguish whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental physics or unresolved systematics in the data.</description>

      <title>Probing dipolar power asymmetry with galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects for probing large-scale statistical anisotropy through galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignments (IA) in Stage IV galaxy surveys. Specifically, we consider a dipolar modulation in the primordial power spectrum and evaluate the Fisher information matrix using the two-point statistics of both the galaxy clustering and IA. Our analysis reveals that while IA alone provides limited improvement in constraining the anisotropy amplitude, the cross-spectrum between galaxy density and IA can contribute up to half the constraining power of galaxy clustering, especially for surveys with low galaxy bias and high number density of galaxies, such as Euclid. This demonstrates the potential of IA-clustering cross-correlations as a robust consistency check against systematics, and highlights the complementary roles of galaxy clustering and IA in constraining cosmic statistical anisotropy. We also show that marginalizing over galaxy bias and IA bias parameters has a negligible impact on the final constraint on the anisotropy amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate tree-level scattering processes involving quarks and gluons mediated by graviton exchange in the framework of Agravity, a dimensionless and renormalizable theory of quadratic quantum gravity. Focusing on the ultra-Planckian regime, we compute the squared amplitudes and analyze the differential cross sections for the processes $gg \rightarrow gg$, $gg \rightarrow q\bar{q}$, $gq \rightarrow gq$, and $qq \rightarrow qq$. We demonstrate that all amplitudes scale as $1/s$ at high energies, in agreement with expectations for a UV-complete theory of gravity. In addition, we explore the issue of unitarity in the presence of higher-derivative ghost modes by analyzing the positivity properties of the squared amplitudes. While IR divergences appear in the forward scattering of massless particles, we show that these are regularized by finite quark masses. Our findings support the viability of Agravity as a perturbatively unitary and UV-complete extension of general relativity, capable of consistently describing gravitational interactions among elementary matter fields at trans-Planckian energies.</description>

      <title>Estimating the binary neutron star merger rate density evolution with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET) is a proposed third-generation, wide-band gravitational wave (GW) detector which will have an improved detection sensitivity in low frequencies, leading to a longer observation time in the detection band and higher detection rate for binary neutron stars (BNSs). Despite the fact that ET will have a higher detection rate, a large fraction of BNSs will remain undetectable. We present a scheme to estimate accurate detection efficiency and to reconstruct the true merger rate density of the population of the BNSs, as a function of redshift. We show that with ET as a single instrumnet, for a population of BNSs with $R_{mer} \sim 100 (300)$ $\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ at $z\sim 0(2)$, we can reconstruct the merger rate density uptil $z \sim 2$ , with a relative error of $12\%$ at ($z \sim 2$), despite the loss in detection of the bulk of the BNS population.</description>

      <title>Area-charge inequality and local rigidity in charged initial data sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric consequences of equality in area-charge inequalities for spherical minimal surfaces and, more generally, for marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS), within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We show that, under appropriate energy and curvature conditions, saturation of the inequality $\mathcal{A} \geq 4\pi(\mathcal{Q}_{\rm E}^2 + \mathcal{Q}_{\rm M}^2)$ imposes a rigid geometric structure in a neighborhood of the surface. In particular, the electric and magnetic fields must be normal to the foliation, and the local geometry is isometric to a Riemannian product. We establish two main rigidity theorems: one in the time-symmetric case and another for initial data sets that are not necessarily time-symmetric. In both cases, equality in the area-charge bound leads to a precise characterization of the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the initial data near the critical surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider wave packets of a massless scalar field that have well-localized Rindler energy, and examine how their energy appears to a Minkowski observer to see how the classical gravitational blue-shift formula is modified quantum mechanically. We derive, by using the saddle point approximation, an analytic expression for the Minkowski momentum distribution of such Rindler wave packets. We find a universal lower bound on the uncertainty of Minkowski momentum; the momentum distribution can never become arbitrarily sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present version 3 of Kira, a Feynman integral reduction program for high-precision calculations in quantum field theory and gravitational-wave physics. Building on previous versions, Kira 3 introduces optimized seeding and equation selection algorithms, significantly improving performance for multi-loop and multi-scale problems. New features include convenient numerical sampling, symbolic integration-by-parts reductions, and support for user-defined additional relations. We demonstrate its capabilities through benchmarks on two- and three-loop topologies, showcasing up to two orders of magnitude improvement over Kira 2.3. Kira 3 is publicly available and poised to support ambitious projects in particle physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>First-order hyperbolic formulation of the pure tetrad teleparallel gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the need for numerical solutions to the Einstein field equations,
  we derive a first-order reduction of the second-order $ f(T) $-teleparallel
  gravity equations in the pure-tetrad formulation (no spin connection). We
  then restrict our attention to the teleparallel equivalent of general
  relativity (TEGR) and propose a 3+1 decomposition of these equations
  suitable for computational implementation. We demonstrate that in vacuum
  (matter-free spacetime) the obtained system of first-order equations is
  equivalent to the tetrad reformulation of general relativity by Estabrook,
  Robinson, Wahlquist, and Buchman and Bardeen, and therefore also admits a
  symmetric hyperbolic formulation. However, the question of hyperbolicity of
  the 3+1 TEGR equations for arbitrary spacetimes remains unaddressed so far.
  Furthermore, the structure of the 3+1 equations resembles a lot of
  similarities with the equations of relativistic electrodynamics and the
  recently proposed dGREM tetrad-reformulation of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Modified Kerr black holes surrounded by dark matter spike</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supermassive black holes (SMBH), surrounded by a dark matter (DM) spike, that can be found at the centers of Milky Way and $\text{M87}$ galaxies and are accompanied by a specific kind of topological defect. The investigation is developed within the framework of Bumblebee Gravity with a global monopole (BGGM). The dark matter spike is described by a power-law density profile. Our main objective is to assess how the background arising from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking and the presence of a global monopole influence the properties of the Kerr BH within the region affected by the spike. Using a spherically symmetric static BH with BGGM properties as the seed metric, we construct a non-rotating spacetime with a DM spike, resulting in a BGGM-motivated Schwarzschild-like BH by solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations (TOV). Next, we extend this approach to the case of a rotating spacetime resulting in the BGGM-motivated Kerr-like BH (BGMKLBH). This approach allows us to explore the spacetime structure, and the BGMKLBH shadows. Then, using available observational data for the DM spike density and considering the effects of BGGM on $\text{Sgr A}^{*}$ and $\text{M87}^{*}$ SMBHs, we analyse the shapes of their shadows and put constraints on the BGGM parameter. Thus, we infer that the BGMKLBHs could be reliable candidates for the astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>On the past maximal development of near-FLRW data for the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the maximal globally hyperbolic development of near-FLRW initial data for the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system exhibits stable Big Bang formation in the collapsing direction. The solutions exhibit stable Kretschmann scalar blow-up, causing the spacetime to become causally geodesically past incomplete, and are asymptotically velocity term dominated. This is the first stability result for the Einstein equations in the collapsing spacetime direction in presence of Vlasov matter that does not rely on any symmetry assumptions. Furthermore, the Vlasov distribution remains close to that of the FLRW solution as a function on the co-mass shell, and so does its momentum support if one assumes it to be close to that of the FLRW distribution initially. On the other hand, the leading order terms in components of the Vlasov energy-momentum tensor exbihit an offset in asymptotic order controlled by the perturbation size, and when viewed on the mass shell, the distribution asymptotically concentrates in certain preferred velocity directions. To ensure that this behaviour is sufficiently mitigated by the scalar field, we crucially exploit a scaling hierarchy between horizontal and vertical derivatives in the commuted Vlasov equation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave effects in the most general vector-tensor theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a model-independent framework based on the Isaacson picture to analyze the gravitational-wave effects in the most general vector-tensor theory that yields second-order field equations. Within this framework, we derive two basic sets of equations for the Isaacson picture. These equations enable the analysis of gravitational wave polarization modes, the dispersion relation of each mode, the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves, and the memory effects. These features are closely tied to observable phenomena and have attracted considerable attention. They are expected to be detected by the next generation of gravitational wave observatories designed to test potential modifications to general relativity. Using this framework, we present the explicit expression for the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves in the most general second-order vector-tensor theory and perform a complete analysis of their polarization modes.</description>

      <title>Search for continuous gravitational waves from unknown neutron stars in binary systems with long orbital periods in O3 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by asymmetric rotating neutron stars are the primary targets of continuous gravitational-wave searches. Neutron stars in binary systems are particularly interesting due to the potential for non-axisymmetric deformations induced by a companion star. However, all-sky searches for unknown neutron stars in binary systems are very computationally expensive and this limits their sensitivity and/or breadth. In this paper we present results of a search for signals with gravitational-wave frequencies between $50$ and $150$~Hz, from systems with orbital periods between $100$ and $1\,000$ days and projected semi-major axes between $40$ and $200$~light-seconds. This parameter-space region has never been directly searched before. We do not detect any signal, and our results exclude gravitational-wave amplitudes above $1.25 \times 10^{-25}$ at $144.32$~Hz with $95\%$ confidence. Our improved search pipeline is more sensitive than any previous all-sky binary search by about $75\%$.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Quasi-Dilaton Massive Gravity with Non-minimal Kinetic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce an extension of the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory and derive the field equations by varying the action with respect to the metric. This extension elucidates the dynamics of the system and demonstrates how it can encompass and recover previous cosmological models through different parameter values. We present the cosmological background equations to analyze self-accelerating solutions that can explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, driven by an effective cosmological constant arising from massive gravity. Besides, we apply the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling to a Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data set to test its viability. Our findings indicate that the theory is able to account for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe without invoking dark energy. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive perturbation analysis examining tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations independently. We derive the dispersion relation of gravitational waves in a Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology and determine the stability conditions of the system. Such an analysis results in a sharper quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling by ensuring the stability conditions of the system are maintained and that strong constraints on theory parameters are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a novel characteristic for chaotic motion by introducing Shannon entropy for periodic orbits, quasiperiodic orbits, and chaotic orbits.We compare our approach with the previous methods including Poincar\'{e} Section, Lyapunov exponent, Fast Lyapunov Indicator, Recurrence plots(Rps), and Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) for orbits around black hole immersed in magnetic fields, and show that they agree with each other quite well. The approach of Shannon entropy is intuitively clear, and theoretically reasonable since it becomes larger and larger form a periodic orbit to chaotic orbit. We demonstrate that Shannon entropy can be a powerful probe to distinguish between chaotic and regular orbits in different spacetimes, and reversely may lead to a new road to define the entropy for a single orbit in phase space, and to find more fundamental relations between thermodynamics and dynamics.</description>

Abstract: For several independent reasons, the idea that notorious sources of entropy could exist in the Universe has been recently revived. Taking advantage of a new framework accounting for non-equilibrium processes in cosmology, we explicitly investigate the cosmological dynamics as a function of the entropy production, focusing on the stability of the system. An exhaustive investigation is performed. As the main physical conclusion, we show that for a wide class of entropy source terms, the fluid dynamics converges towards an effective cosmological constant. Constraints on the associated entropic force are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, Bardeen and Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological degrees of freedom of Proca field with non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity through the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar interactions. We show that in the homogeneous and isotropic Universe together with cosmological constant, the temporal component of the vector field acquires a background value. As a result, we show that the theory propagates an additional degree of freedom, with respect to the generalized Proca theories, whose kinetic term suggests the presence of several strong coupling regimes that depend on the value of the background solution, the combination and vanishing of coupling constants, together with a scale-dependent one. We show in addition, that the speed of propagation for this mode vanishes, indicating the presence of another type of strong coupling. To further investigate this, we extend our analysis to the Bianchi Type I Universe, with the most general solution for the vector field. We show that the extra degree of freedom remains in the theory. Among the modes, we further show that the mode with vanishing speed of propagation is still present, pointing to the strong coupling. In addition, we discover a mode with scale-dependent strong coupling (vanishing kinetic term), one mode that propagates only in one single direction and two unstable modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing the stability of quasinormal modes (QNM) is essential for understanding black hole dynamics, particularly in the context of gravitational wave emissions and black hole spectroscopy. In this study, we employ the hyperboloidal approach to reformulate the quasinormal mode problem of a rotating analog black hole, effectively transforming it into an eigenvalue problem associated with a nonself-adjoint operator. Using this method, we examine the influence of rotation on the stability of the QNM spectrum, relying on the associated pseudospectrum for qualitative assessment. Our findings indicate that the prograde overtones become more stable as rotation increases. This work enhances our understanding of spectrum stability in rotating systems and expands the study of pseudospectra in non-spherically symmetric spacetimes, with potential for empirical testing in terrestrial laboratories.</description>

      <title>Consistency relations between multimessenger and large scale structure observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a unified model independent theoretical framework to study the effects of dark energy and modified gravity. We show that applying the EFT to Horndeski theories it is possible to derive consistency relations (CR) between physically observable quantities, valid for different classes of theories defined by the brading parameter behavior, while leaving the other property functions free. As expected, the CRs are also valid for general relativity, and relate the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity distances and the speed of gravitational waves (GW). We apply the CRs to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints. The CRs allow to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter with multimessenger observations, independently from large scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Hodge Dual Gauge Symmetry in Minimal Einstein-Aether Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein-aether gravity is a theory that breaks the local Lorentz symmetry by introducing a preferred direction via a vector field, which is considered to play the role of an aether. The theory is identified by four coupling constants between the aether and gravity. Minimal Einstein-aether is the special case in which only one of the couplings is non-zero. We show that the aether vector field in its minimal version is Hodge dual to a gauge field. The gauge symmetry in the dual description has been known for decades and has been used to implement a cosmological constant into the Lagrangian. As a result, solutions to the well-established gauge theory can be transferred into the minimal Einstein-aether theory straightforwardly. On the other hand, some of the proposed solutions to the minimal Einstein-aether theory could be discarded as pure gauges of the vanishing aether. We prove as a theorem that this holds true for all divergence-less aether fields.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Thermodynamics in Harada's inspired theory of gravity: Stability, Phase Structure and Geometrothermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of spherically symmetric, static black hole solutions within the framework of Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG). This is a modified theory of gravity that retains all solutions of General Relativity, while addressing some of its theoretical shortcomings and enriching gravitational phenomenology at large distances. We derive key thermodynamic quantities, including mass, temperature, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy, to examine the stability and phase structure of extended Schwarzschild-AdS and charged AdS black holes. Furthermore, employing the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we analyze the behavior of the thermodynamic curvature scalar to identify critical points and characterize phase transitions. Our results demonstrate that the parameter \( \lambda \), which quantifies deviations from Einstein's theory, plays a pivotal role in shaping the thermodynamic behavior, resulting in new stability conditions and distinct phase transition patterns compared to those predicted by standard General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of the wormhole in the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld spacetime with a cosmic string</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study gravitational lensing of the wormhole in the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) spacetime that incorporates with a cosmic string. It was found that the presence of cosmic string can enhance the light deflection in strong field limit, compared to the case of the Eills-Bronnikov wormhole. The magnification effects of this composite structure could cause some substantial impacts on the angle separation between the first and the rest of the images, and their relative brightness. Furthermore, based on these observables, we model some observable aspects in the strong and the weak field limits. The presence of a cosmic string can affect some distinguishable observables compared to the wormhole without cosmic string. This work could deepen our understanding of the spacetime structure of the wormhole in EiBI spacetime with one-dimensional topological defects.</description>

      <title>Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_s$, its running index $\alpha_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyze the gravitational deflection for a light beam in the weak and strong field regimes for the gravitational analogue geometry of an acoustic black hole (ABH) and acoustic black-bounce (ABB). Motivationally, the first spacetime arises as an exact solution of the field equations for gravitational black holes (BHs) in an Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory (EsGB) \cite{3}. In contrast, the second model arises from the combination of phantom scalar field and nonlinear electrodynamics in general relativity (GR) \cite{INTRO24}. We construct analytical expressions for the angular deflection of light in both limits and, from them, analyze the construction of the observables, which allow us to relate theoretical models to observational data. We compare these observables and show how much they differ from those obtained in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Torsional Effects in the Coupling between Gravity and Spinors -- Yukawa Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spinors in the framework of general relativity, starting from the Dirac field Lagrangian in the approximation of weak gravity. We focus on how fermions couple to gravity through the spin connection, and we analyze these couplings by analogy with the Ginzburg-Landau model and the Yukawa interaction known from the Higgs mechanism. By solving the field equations, we explore how these couplings affect the spacetime metric. In particular, torsion generated by fermionic spin currents naturally emerges and leads to the breaking of Lorentz symmetry. As a consequence, gravity acquires a mass and fermions gain additional mass contributions through their interaction with this gravitational field. These effects are localized and diminish quickly with distance. Our model offers an alternative explanation to phenomena usually attributed to dark matter and dark energy. We link these cosmological effects to chirality-flip processes of Majorana neutrinos interacting with a massive graviton. Right-handed Majorana neutrinos, which are sterile under Standard Model interactions, generate repulsive gravitational curvature and act as a source of dark energy, while left-handed neutrinos contribute to attractive gravitational effects akin to dark matter. The spin-gravity coupling modifies the curvature of spacetime, influencing galaxy rotation, the accelerated expansion of the universe, and the bending of light. In short, the intrinsic spin of fermions, when coupled to gravity via torsion, changes gravity from a long-range, massless force to a short-range, massive one. This new framework provides fresh insights into fundamental physics and cosmology, potentially explaining dark matter and dark energy phenomena through spin-related gravitational effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math., 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Classical Observables from Causal Response Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of classical observables from causal response functions, following up on recent work by Caron-Huot at al. [JHEP 01 (2024) 139]. We derive a formula to compute asymptotic in-in observables from a particular soft limit of five-point amputated response functions. Using such formula, we re-derive the formulas by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC) for the linear impulse and radiated linear momentum of particles undergoing scattering, and we present an unambiguous calculation of the radiated angular momentum at leading order. Then, we explore the consequences of manifestly causal Feynman rules in the calculation of classical observables by employing the causal (Keldysh) basis in the in-in formalism. We compute the linear impulse, radiated waveform and its variance at leading and/or next-to-leading order in the causal basis, and find that all terms singular in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit cancel manifestly at the integrand level. We also find that the calculations simplify considerably and classical properties such as factorization of six-point amplitudes are more transparent in the causal basis.</description>

      <title>Observable Primordial Gravitational Waves from Non-minimally Coupled $R^2$ Palatini Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We probe the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) produced during the eras of hyperkination, kination, and reheating in a non-minimally coupled, $\mathcal{L} \propto (1+ \xi \chi /M_{\text{Pl}})^t (R+\alpha R^2)$, modified gravity using the Palatini formulation. We consider a runaway potential, which gives an era of kinetic domination after the end of inflation. The coupling order $t$ is varied to examine a large class of theories up to $\chi^2 R^2$. For models with $t&gt;0$, reheating is not achieved naturally; hence, we supplement such theories with a reheating mechanism based on the interaction of inflaton and radiation produced at the end of inflation due to cosmological expansion. We demonstrate that the energy density of the GWs is enhanced as a function of the coupling during kination for all considered theories, and a short-lived phase of hyperkination truncates the boost and avoids the over-production of GWs. Hyperkination, and thus the $R^2$ term, should be deemed necessary in all theories with a runaway potential as it prevents the GW enhancement during kination from destabilizing the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The spectrum remains flat for the period of hyperkination and reheating. We examine the available parameter space for which the theories remain valid and place bounds on the Hubble parameter ($H$) and radiation energy density ($\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$) at the end of inflation. We find that as we decrease the order of the coupling, the spectra shift towards a more observable regime of future GW experiments. The observation of the plateau during reheating will constrain the $H$ and $\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$ values, while the spectral shape of the boost obtained during kination will confirm the nature of the theory. The bounds from hyperkination lie in the kHz-GHz frequency range.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Carrollian fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the first example of interacting quantized Carrollian Dirac fermions and investigate their discrete symmetries, including charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T) transformations. As a toy model, we couple these fermions to a Carrollian scalar field using Carrollian Yukawa theory and compute the tree-level diagram, revealing an ultralocal interaction between the Carrollian fermions and the scalar field. This interaction, widely known as a Dirac delta interaction with time-dependent factor, frequently appears in quantum physics. We then address the renormalization of the theory by employing the Wilsonian procedure at one-loop order. Furthermore, we analyze the fixed points and stability properties of Carrollian Yukawa theory, comparing them with their relativistic counterparts. Beyond the specific Yukawa model studied here, we expect that our framework will have broader applications in Carrollian physics, particularly in understanding ultralocal interactions and their role in condensed matter systems, where similar phenomena arise in strongly correlated and non-relativistic regimes.</description>

Abstract: Based on the studies of pseudo-entropy in de Sitter, there have been recent proposals for a timelike entanglement in AdS/CFT. In this work, we explore this proposal in the context of a holographic CFT undergoing a global quench. We study various cases in which the timelike intervals are anchored at various boundary times, sometimes straddling the infalling shell. Our results seem to be consistent with how the quenched CFT evolves towards thermalization.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $4.0 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 3$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.05221 \pm 0.0007$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence with a closed-form solution. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,61(76))$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>

      <title>What Price Fiber Bundle Substantivalism? On How to Avoid Holes in Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a mathematically foundational level, our most successful physical theories (gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories) are formulated in a framework based on the differential geometry of connections on principal bundles. After reviewing the essentials of this framework, we articulate the generalized hole and point-coincidence arguments, examining how they weight on a substantivalist position towards bundle spaces. This question, then, is considered in light of the Dressing Field Method, which allows a manifestly invariant reformulation of gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories, making their conceptual structure more transparent: it formally implements the point-coincidence argument and thus allows to define (dressed) fields and (dressed) bundle spaces immune to hole-type arguments.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <title>The Relative Fermionic Entropy in Two-Dimensional Rindler Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fermionic relative entropy in two-dimensional Rindler spacetime is studied using both modular theory and the reduced one-particle density operators. The methods and results are compared. A formula for the relative entropy for general Gaussian states is derived. As an application, the relative entropy is computed for a class of non-unitary excitations.</description>

      <title>Standard Running, "Physical Running", Cosmological Constant and Newton Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently it is asserted that the standard beta function does not describe the correct running of the coupling constant in some theories. We show that the problem arises from the assumption $\mu=p$ ($\mu$ is a renormalization point) and that a suitable choice of $\mu$ gives the correct running. It is also claimed that neither the cosmological constant nor Newton coupling run. We argue that running can be discussed when we consider the curved spacetime.</description>
