      <title>4D Track Reconstruction on Free-Streaming Data at PANDA at FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new generation of experiments is being developed, where the challenge of separating rare signal processes from background at high intensities requires a change of trigger paradigm. At the future PANDA experiment at FAIR, hardware triggers will be abandoned and instead a purely software-based system will be used. This requires novel reconstruction methods with the ability to process data from many events simultaneously.
  A 4D tracking algorithm based on the cellular automaton has been developed which will utilize the timing information from detector signals. Simulation studies have been performed to test its performance on the foreseen free-streaming data from the PANDA detector. For this purpose, a quality assurance procedure for tracking on free-streaming data was implemented in the PANDA software. The studies show that at higher interaction rates, 4D tracking performs better than the 3D algorithm in terms of efficiency, 84% compared to 77%. The fake track suppression is also greatly improved, compared to the 3D tracking with roughly a 50% decrease in the ghost rate.</description>

      <title>Nuclear uncertainties associated with the ejecta of a neutron-star black-hole accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of heavy element nucleosynthesis requires input from yet-to-be-measured nuclear properties. The uncertainty in the values of these off-stability nuclear properties propagates to uncertainties in the predictions of elemental and isotopic abundances. However, for any given astrophysical explosion, there are many different trajectories, i.e. temperature and density histories, experienced by outflowing material and thus different nuclear properties can come into play. We consider combined nucleosynthesis results from 460,000 trajectories from a neutron star-black hole accretion disk and the find spread in elemental predictions due solely to unknown nuclear properties to be a factor of a few. We analyze this relative spread in model predictions due to nuclear variations and conclude that the uncertainties can be attributed to a combination of properties in a given region of the abundance pattern. We calculate a cross-correlation between mass changes and abundance changes to show how variations among the properties of participating nuclei may be explored. Our results provide further impetus for measurements of multiple quantities on individual short-lived neutron-rich isotopes at modern experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Significance of the refraction effect on the $p$-$d$ elementary process in the ($p$,$pd$) reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton-induced deuteron knockout reaction, ($p$,$pd$), is one of the interests in the studies for probing the deuteron-like $p$-$n$ correlation in nuclei. According to a recent study of the inclusive deuteron-induced reaction, $(d,d'x)$, the refraction effect of the deuteron has a significant effect on the elementary process, nucleon-deuteron ($N$-$d$) binary scattering inside a nucleus, of the reaction. In the paper, it is shown that proper treatment of the local $N$-$d$ relative momentum in the elementary process is crucial in $(d,d'x)$ reactions at $100$ MeV and below. In the present work, we investigate the deuteron refraction effect in the exclusive ($p$,$pd$) reactions. We also discuss the incident energy dependence of the refraction effect. The refraction effect on the $p$-$d$ elementary process is taken into account by the local semiclassical approximation to the distorted waves. The results are compared with those obtained with the asymptotic momentum approximation, which is standardly applied to the distorted wave impulse approximation framework. %The $(p,pd)$ cross sections at 101.3 MeV and 250 MeV are studied to see the incident energy dependence of the refraction effect. It is shown that the refraction effect drastically changes the energy sharing distribution of the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and gives a better agreement with experimental data. In contrast, it is confirmed that the effect is negligibly small at 250 MeV. We have clarified that the deuteron refraction effect is significant in the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and the experimental data are well reproduced. The refraction effect plays a significant role in both the shape and magnitude of the ($p$,$pd$) cross section, while the effect is negligible at 250 MeV.</description>

      <title>Jet angularities in dijet production in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study jet angularities for dijet production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in proton-proton (pp) and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions at 200 GeV nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass collision energy. In particular, we provide $\mathrm{NLL}$ resummed predictions for angularity observables of groomed and ungroomed jets produced in $\rm pp$ collisions matched to next-to-leading order QCD calculations resulting in $\mathrm{NLO+NLL^\prime}$ accuracy. Our parton-level predictions are corrected for non-perturbative effects, such as hadronization and underlying event, using parton-to-hadron level transfer matrices obtained with the Sherpa event generator. Furthermore, we use the Q-Pythia and JEWEL generators to estimate the impact of the interaction between quarks and gluons produced by the parton shower with the dense medium formed in heavy-ion collisions on the considered jet angularities.</description>

      <title>SIDIS at small $x$ at next-to-leading order: gluon contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of gluons to single inclusive hadron production at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small $x$ using the Color Glass Condensate formalism. It is shown that the only divergence present is the standard collinear divergence which is absorbed into evolution of gluon-hadron fragmentation function. Our calculations are performed at finite $N_c$ and we provide general finite $N_c$ expressions for the structure of Wilson lines appearing in inclusive dihadron and single hadron production cross sections. We also comment on how one can obtain rapidity distribution of hadron multiplicities from our results.</description>
