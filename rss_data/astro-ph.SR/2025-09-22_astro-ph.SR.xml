      <title>Radiation Hydrodynamic Simulations of Low-Energy Explosions of Red and Yellow Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variety of physical processes leads to the low-energy ejection of material from the hydrogen-rich envelopes of red and yellow supergiants. These include common envelope events, stellar mergers, eruptive mass loss, and failed supernovae. These events may appear as luminous red novae, intermediate luminosity red transients, supernova imposters, or other transients with similar lightcurves and colors that are followed by the disappearance of the progenitor star (e.g. failed supernovae). The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will find these events in large numbers; detailed modeling of their lightcurves is essential for photometrically differentiating between these important physical processes in the lives of massive stars. We use one-dimensional, radiation hydrodynamic simulations to model the lightcurves of low-energy explosions of red and yellow supergiants. Red supergiant explosions have durations of 100-400 days, longer than Type IIp supernovae, while stripped, yellow supergiant explosions have durations of 10s of days. Our models probe the boundary between the radiation-pressure dominated and gas-pressure dominated regimes. We provide fitting formulae for the plateau luminosity and duration of the events. Finally, we show that the failed supernovae candidates in NGC 6946 and M31 are consistent with failed supernovae models for explosion energies of $\sim10^{47}-10^{49}$ erg.</description>

      <title>A joint 1% calibration of the RR Lyrae &amp; type-II Cepheid Leavitt laws yields homogeneous distances to 93 Galactic globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has established large samples of astrometrically confirmed RR Lyrae and type-II Cepheid members of Galactic globular clusters (GCs). Any given GC can contain multiple such stars at once, notably RR Lyrae stars pulsating in the fundamental mode (RRab) or the first overtone (RRc), and type-II Cepheids (T2Cep) of BL Her and W Vir types. Here, we present the first joint calibration of the Leavitt laws (LLs) exhibited by 802 RRab, 345 RRc, and 21 T2Cep stars anchored to trigonometric parallaxes. Using the third data release of the ESA Gaia mission (GDR3), we have calibrated the intercepts of the RRab and RRc Leavitt laws in the reddening-free Gaia Wesenheit magnitude to better than 1.0% in distance, and that of T2Cep to 1.3%, using a global fit to all data. The absolute scale is set by 37 nearby GCs with high-accuracy parallaxes while 56 additional GCs provide constraints on LL slopes as well as the LL intercept differences of RRc and T2Cep relative to RRab stars. Our global fit yields homogeneous high-accuracy distances of 93 GCs that show no evidence of bias for Gaia parallaxes of distant GCs. Control of systematics was demonstrated by 31 alternative fit variants, notably involving different treatments of metallicity effects, as well as by Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results suggest that photometric metallicities of RR Lyrae stars require further improvements while also exhibiting possible signs of intra-cluster chemical inhomogeneity. This work lays the foundation for exploiting RRab, RRc, and T2Cep stars as high-accuracy standard candles for near-field cosmology and the extragalactic distance scale.</description>

      <title>Image calibration between the Extreme Ultraviolet Imagers on Solar Orbiter and the Solar Dynamics Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study and monitor the Sun and its atmosphere, various space missions have been launched in the past decades. With the rapid improvement in technology and different mission requirements, the data products are subject to constant change. However, for long-term studies such as solar variability or multi-instrument investigations, uniform data series are required. In this study, we build on and expand the Instrument-to-Instrument translation (ITI) framework, which provides unpaired image translations. We apply the tool to data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI), specifically the Full Sun Imager (FSI) on Solar Orbiter (SolO) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This approach allows us to create a homogeneous data set that combines the two extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagers. We demonstrate that ITI is able to provide image calibration between SolO and SDO EUV imagers, independent of the varying orbital position of SolO. The comparison of the intercalibrated light curves derived from EUI and AIA shows that ITI can provide uniform data series that outperform a standard baseline calibration. We evaluate the perceptual similarity in terms of the Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that ITI achieves a significant improvement of perceptual similarity between EUI and AIA. The study provides intercalibrated observations from SolO/EUI/FSI with SDO/AIA, enabling a homogeneous data set suitable for solar cycle studies and multi viewpoint investigations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effects of Parameters in Widespread SEP Events with EPREM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Model (EPREM) solves the focused transport equation (FTE) on a Lagrangian grid in a frame co-moving with the solar wind plasma and simulates the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles (SEP) in the heliosphere. When not coupled to an external magnetohydrodynamic model, EPREM functions in an uncoupled mode where an ideal cone-shock is injected into a homogeneous background solar wind. We carried out an analysis of the effects of multiple physical parameters in producing widespread SEP events simulated by the uncoupled EPREM using a relatively simple model of a strong magnetized shock propagating radially outward through the inner heliosphere to produce the requisite MHD quantities for EPREM's sophisticated model of proton acceleration and transport. We compared a baseline simulation with seven variations in which the value of a single parameter differed from its baseline value. All simulations exhibit complex profiles of SEP flux as a function of time and energy, with clear dependence on parameters related to diffusion, mean free path, and shock profile. Moreover, while all simulations exhibit significant longitudinal spread in SEP flux, for certain parameter values there exists a decrease or absence in SEP flux at observers located &gt;=90 degrees from the shock origin. Relating the differences in SEP flux to the specific values of each parameter in the simulations provides insight into the morphology of observed SEP events and the state of the solar wind through which the driving CME propagates.</description>

      <title>Possible First Detection of Gyroresonance Emission from a Coronal Mass Ejection in the Middle Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Routine measurements of the magnetic field of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been a key challenge in solar physics. Making such measurements is important both from a space weather perspective and for understanding the detailed evolution of the CME. In spite of significant efforts and multiple proposed methods, achieving this goal has not been possible to date. Here we report the first possible detection of gyroresonance emission from a CME. Assuming that the emission is happening at the third harmonic, we estimate that the magnetic field strength ranges from 7.9--5.6 G between 4.9-7.5 $R_\odot$. We also demonstrate that this high magnetic field is not the average magnetic field inside the CME, but most probably is related to small magnetic islands, which are also being observed more frequently with the availability of high-resolution and high-quality white-light images.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Mass Loss and the Kinetic Energy of Solar Coronal Mass with Far-Ultraviolet Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar eruptive events, such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), can affect planetary habitability by disturbing the stability of their atmospheres. For instance, strong stellar flares and CMEs can trigger atmospheric escape and, in extreme cases, may strip away the atmosphere completely. While stellar flares have been observed and explored at a wide range of wavelengths, the physical properties of stellar CMEs remain unconstrained due to the difficulty in observing them. In this context, the Sun provides our only window on the potential characteristics of CMEs on Sun-like stars. A correlation between solar X-ray flare peak flux and the mass of flare-associated solar CMEs has been reported using solar data collected during Solar Cycle 23 (1996-2006) (Aarnio et al. 2011). Here, we build upon that work. We extend the correlation into the far-UV (FUV), where stellar flares are and will be routinely detected with existing and future FUV observatories by incorporating data spanning two entire Solar Cycles (23 and 24; 1996-2019). Using three different space missions (CMEs from LASCO/SOHO, X-ray flare events from XRS/GOES, and FUV flares from AIA/SDO), we report a correlation between FUV flare peak flux and energy centered at 1600{\AA} and mass, kinetic energy, and linear speed of flare-associated CMEs. These empirical relations enable estimates of CME masses and kinetic energies from FUV flares on Sun-like stars. While direct stellar-CME detections remain elusive, the correlations derived here are likely applicable to Sun-like stars and provide a working framework for evaluating exoplanet atmospheric erosion.</description>

      <title>A New Subclass of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars at Extremely Low Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new subclass of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, characterized by high absolute carbon abundances (A(C) &gt; 7.39) and extremely low metallicity ([Fe/H] $&lt;=$ -3.1) but notably lacking enhancements in neutron-capture elements, thus falling under the CEMP-no category. This population emerged from a detailed analysis of low-resolution spectroscopic data obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), where the observed frequency trends with the decreasing metallicity of CEMP-s (s-process-enhanced) and CEMP-no (no neutron-capture enhanced) stars deviated from established expectations. In contrast to earlier findings, we observe a rise in high-A(C) stars below [Fe/H] = -3.1, which we interpret as a distinct group not accounted for in traditional CEMP classifications. Following the Yoon-Beers group classification, we define these stars as Group IV. Statistical modeling confirms their presence as a separate peak in the A(C) distribution, and available radial velocity data suggest that about 30% of Group IV stars may be binaries, indicating possible binary-related formation mechanisms. This discovery challenges the current CEMP-no star formation pathways and implies the existence of alternative or hybrid enrichment scenarios in the early Universe. High-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of Group IV candidates will be crucial for identifying their progenitors and understanding their evolutionary implications.</description>

      <title>A search for chemical stratification and magnetic fields in eight field blue horizontal-branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the results of an analysis of chemical abundances and a search for magnetic fields in eight field blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars: BD\,+01$^{\circ}$0548, HD\,74721, HD\,86986, HD\,87112, HD\,93329, HD\,109995, HD\,161817, and HD\,167105. This study is based on high-resolution optical spectra obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We first calculated the average chemical element abundance, the rotational velocity, and the radial velocity of the stars using the ZEEMAN2 spectrum synthesis code with the PHOENIX model atmospheres. We then studied the abundances of titanium and iron inferred from individual lines in the spectra of each star and their variations with their predicted formation depths $\tau_{\rm 5000}$. Similarly to the BHB stars cooler than 11500~K observed in globular clusters, no clear observational evidence of vertical stratification is detected in the atmosphere of these stars. In the second part of this project, we searched for the presence of a magnetic field in the stars applying the Least-Squares Deconvolution technique on the Stokes $I$ and $V$ spectra. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field uncertainties, ranging from 8 to 30~G, effectively rule out the presence of an organized magnetic field in these targets with a strength larger than a few 100~G.</description>

      <title>Population-Dependent r-process Scatter in the Globular Cluster M15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple populations, defined by correlations between light element abundances, are an almost ubiquitous property of globular clusters. On the other hand, dispersions among the heavy elements are limited to a few rare clusters. In this letter, we present Mg, Y, Ba, La, and Eu measurements for 89 stars in M15 with errors &lt; 0.4 dex from Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectra. We find higher Ba, La, and Eu dispersions in the first generation of stars than in the second generation at a significance of $\ge$2 $\sigma$. This is evidence for inhomogeneous mixing of gas during the formation of the first generation of stars, which subsequently became well-mixed prior to the formation of the second generation of stars. If the r-process event that caused the abundance dispersions was born with the first population of stars, it must be an r-process site with a short delay time.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux ropes within reconnection exhausts close to the centers of heliospheric current sheets near the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the relationship between magnetic flux ropes and magnetic reconnection is fundamental to both space and astrophysical plasma studies. In this study, we report on two consecutive heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossings by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), separated by ~10.5 hours, at a heliocentric distance of ~12 solar radii. For each crossing, we identified a series of flux ropes embedded within reconnection exhausts on the sunward side of X-line. Their passage durations are &lt;20sec, corresponding to spatial scales of a few thousands kilometers, still larger by three orders of magnitude than ion inertial length. This identification was possible particularly during intervals when PSP was closest to the HCS center. These flux ropes are distinguishable from the background exhausts by enhancements in magnetic field strength, significantly in the guide field component, travel speed slightly faster (typically by &lt;10km/s) than surrounding outflows, and often accompanied by, though not always, increased density and reduced temperature. We attribute their origin to secondary reconnection within the exhausts and subsequent merging of smaller flux ropes into larger structures, consistent with predictions by various simulations. We suggest that such flux ropes are most readily identifiable at the HCS center where the background magnetic field is weakest so that the relative enhancement in flux rope field becomes most prominent. This observational advantage is particularly notable closer to the Sun where the high ambient magnetic field strength can otherwise obscure such structures unless the spacecraft trajectory remains within the HCS central region for a sufficient duration.</description>

      <title>The Impact of ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ Reaction on the Evolution of He Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction is one of the most important reactions in the evolution of massive stars, yet its rate is still highly uncertain. In this work, we investigated how variations in the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate affect the evolution of a 14 $\rm M_{\odot}$ He star using the MESA code. Our simulations indicate that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction rate determines the conditions for C burning, affecting its explodability. As the reaction rate increases, central C-burning becomes neutrino-dominated, transitioning from the convective to the radiative regime. This leads to higher compactness and a larger iron core, indicating a more compact pre-SN core structure that is difficult to explode. Conversely, lower reaction rates shorten the C-burning lifetime and trigger earlier central Ne ignition, which counteracts core contraction. This results in reduced compactness and iron core mass. We also found that variations in reaction rates shift the location of the last C-burning shell. When this shell exceeds the mass coordinate used for compactness evaluation, the overall compactness increases significantly. Although the Si- and O-burning convective shells decrease compactness, the overall increase remains unaffected. This work suggests that the ${}^{12} \mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16} \mathrm{O}$ reaction play an important role in the pre-SN core structure and potentially impact the explodability of massive He stars.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Solar-Terrestrial Plasma and Magnetic Field on the Detection of Space-borne Gravitational Wave Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detections raise new questions for heliophysics: how the Sun-Terrestrial space environment affect gravitational wave detection, and to what extent? Space-borne gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure displacement variations between two free test masses caused by gravitational waves. Space-borne gravitational wave detectors require extremely high measurement accuracy, making it necessary to take into account the effects of space plasma and magnetic field. On one hand, laser propagation through space plasma can induce optical path difference noise, affecting distance measurement accuracy. On the other hand, interactions between space magnetic field and the test masses can generate acceleration noise. This review introduces studies on laser propagation noise and space magnetic acceleration noise in space gravitational wave detection. And this review presents a method, time-delay interferometry, to suppress laser propagation noise.</description>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a new short-period pre-main-sequence eclipsing binary, RX Gru, orbited by a distant circumbinary companion. We characterized the system by analysing the photometric observations from the Solaris network, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and the Super Wide Angle Search for Planets survey, combined with the radial velocities from four high-resolution spectrographs: HARPS, FEROS, CHIRON, and HRS. We derived the parameters of the eclipsing components, which are $M_{\rm Aa} = 1.004^{+0.027}_{-0.026}\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{\rm Aa} = 1.007\pm0.021\,$R$_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,Aa} = 5379\pm289\,$K for the primary, and $M_{\rm Ab} = 0.985^{+0.024}_{-0.025}\,$M$_\odot$, $R_{\rm Ab} = 1.024\pm0.023\,$R$_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,Ab} = 5322\pm278\,$K for the secondary. We determined the age of the system from the observed parameters using two evolution codes, MESA and Cesam2k20. We obtained an age of $\sim$28$\,$Myr, placing the two stars at the very end of the pre-main-sequence phase. We also derived the minimum mass and orbital period of the tertiary companion, which are found to be $M_{\rm B} = 89.0\pm3.5\,$M$_{\rm Jup}$ and $P_{\rm AB} = 23.79 ^{+0.10 }_{-0.25}\,$yr, respectively. We conclude that RX Gru consists of a tight inner binary composed of two twin components and an outer low-mass companion (a massive brown dwarf or a very low-mass star) in a relatively wide orbit, and we suggest that the system was formed via the dynamical unfolding mechanism coupled with the shared accretion of the circumbinary material by the binary components.</description>

      <title>The fractions of reflection effect systems detected in different subclasses of hot subdwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot subdwarfs with close low-mass M-type or brown dwarf companions usually show the reflection effect and often also eclipses. Through inspecting the light variations, we estimate the fractions of reflection effect systems detected in different subclasses of hot subdwarfs and constrain their possible formation channels. We noticed that none of the helium-rich hot subdwarfs were found with the reflection effect. Most of them might form through the merger channel. About 13\% of the He-poor hot subdwarfs on the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 25,000 -- 33,000 K are discovered with the reflection effect. Nevertheless, the cooler hot subdwarfs located on the top of the EHB, those grouped on the bottom of the EHB, and those located above the EHB with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 45,000 -- 75,000 K exhibit lower fractions of reflection effect systems of about 2\%. These three subclasses of hot subdwarfs might contain higher fractions of single stars. Hot subdwarfs below the EHB also show a low fraction of reflection effect systems. They might have a higher fraction of stars with close WD companions. A similar fraction of reflection effect systems to those on the EHB with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 25,000 -- 33,000 K is found in hot subdwarfs located above the EHB with $T_{\rm eff}$ $\sim$ 35,000 -- 45,000 K. We also discovered that hot subdwarfs close to the Galactic Plane might have a higher fraction of stars with the reflection effect than those at higher latitudes.</description>

      <title>Role of sunspot latitude versus tilt in determining the polar field and amplitude of the next cycle: Cause of the weak Solar Cycle 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One prominent feature of solar cycle is its irregular variation in its cycle strength, making it challenging to predict the amplitude of the next cycle. Studies show that fluctuations and nonlinearity in generating poloidal field throughout the decay and dispersal of tilted sunspots produce variation in the solar cycle. The flux, latitudinal position, and tilt angle of sunspots are the primary parameters that determine the polar field and, thus, the next solar cycle strength. By analysing the observed sunspots and polar field proxy, we show that the nonlinearity in the poloidal field generation becomes important for strong cycles. Except for strong cycles, we can reasonably predict the polar field at the end of the cycle (and thus the next cycle strength) using the total sunspot area alone. Combining the mean tilt angle and latitude positions with the sunspot area, we can predict the polar field of Cycles 15 -- 24 (or the amplitude of sunspot Cycles 16-25) with reasonable accuracy except for Cycle 23 for which the average tilt angle cannot predict the polar field. For Cycles 15--22, we show that the average tilt angle variation dominates over the latitude variation in determining the polar field of a cycle. In particular, the reduction of tilt in Cycle 19 was the primary cause of the following weak cycle (Cycle 20). Thus, we conclude that tilt quenching is essential in regulating the solar cycle strength in the solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Multi-spacecraft Measurements of the Evolving Geometry of the Solar Alfv\'en Surface Over Half a Solar Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of a star's Alfv\'en surface determines stellar angular momentum loss, separates a causally distinct 'corona' and stellar wind, and potentially affects exoplanetary habitability. The solar Alfv\'en surface is the only such structure that is directly measurable and since 2021, has been routinely measured in situ by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (Parker). We use these unique measurements in concert with Solar Orbiter and L1 in situ data spanning the first half of the Solar Cycle 25 in time and from 0.045 - 1 au in heliocentric distance to develop a radial scaling technique to estimate the morphology of the Alfv\'en surface from measurements of the solar wind speed and local Alfv\'en speed. We show that accounting for solar wind acceleration and mass flux is necessary to achieve reasonable agreement between the scaled location of the Alfv\'en surface and the locations of direct crossings measured by Parker. We produce continuous 2D equatorial cuts of the Alfv\'en surface over half a Solar Cycle (ascending phase and maximum). Parker's earliest crossings clipped outward extrusions, many of which are likely transient related, while more recently Parker has unambiguously sampled deep sub-Alfv\'enic flows. We analyze the average altitude, departure from spherical symmetry, and surface roughness, finding that all are positively correlated to solar activity. For the current modest Solar Cycle, the height varies up to 30\% which corresponds to a near-doubling in angular momentum loss per unit mass loss.</description>

      <title>Backtracking Bipolar Magnetic Regions to their emergence: Two groups and their implication in the tilt measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) that appear on the solar photosphere are surface manifestations of the solar internal magnetic field. With modern observations and continuous data streams, the study of BMRs has moved from manual sunspot catalogs to automated detection and tracking methods. In this work, we present an additional module to the existing BMR tracking algorithm, AutoTAB, that focuses on identifying emerging signatures of BMRs. Specifically, for regions newly detected on the solar disk, this module backtracks the BMRs to their point of emergence. From a total of about 12000 BMRs identified by AutoTAB, we successfully backtracked 3080 cases. Within this backtracked sample, we find two distinct populations. One group shows the expected behaviour of emerging regions, in which the magnetic flux increases significantly during the emerging phase. The other group consists of BMRs whose flux, however, does not exhibit substantial growth during their evolution. We classify these as non-emerging BMRs and examine their statistical properties separately. Our analysis shows that these non-emerging BMRs do not display any preferred tilt angle distribution nor show systematic latitudinal tilt dependence, in contrast to the trends typically associated with emerging BMRs. This indicates that including such regions in statistical studies of BMR properties can distort or mask the underlying physical characteristics. We therefore emphasise the importance of excluding the non-emerging population from the whole dataset when analysing the statistical behaviour of BMRs.</description>

      <title>eROSITA-selection of new period-bounce Cataclysmic Variables: First follow-up confirmation using TESS and SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between 40$\%$ and 80$\%$ of cataclysmic variables (CVs) are expected to have evolved past the period-minimum and contain a degenerate donor. However, observational surveys for CVs have only been able to detect a few of these highly evolved "period-bouncers", most likely due to the intrinsic faintness associated with their predicted low mass accretion rates. We have produced an initial selection of 137 high-likelihood period-bounce candidates from WD catalog based on our multiwavelength period-bouncer scorecard and selection cuts including X-ray data from the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma spacecraft (SRG). We have laid out three main requirements (classification as a CV, determination of an orbital period and detection of a very late-type donor) that should result in the confirmation of several of these candidates. Our path for confirming these candidates has already produced its first successful result with the confirmation of GALEX J125751.4-283015 as a new period-bouncer. Several other candidates have already fulfilled at least one of our three requirements making their future confirmation likely. Our search for period-bouncers using the X-ray eROSITA emission of objects in optical WD catalogs has led to the confirmation of six new period-bouncers identified from the Gaia DR3 WD catalog (five previously known CVs and one WD candidate), a 18$\%$ increase that brings the present population to 39 systems. Both the selection method for period-bounce candidates and the confirmation path that we outlined will aid in future searches for new period-bounce candidates, contributing to the goal of resolving the discrepancy between the predicted high number of period-bouncers and the low number of these systems successfully observed to date.</description>

      <title>Extreme Ultraviolet Wave and Quasi-periodic Pulsations during an eruptive M-class Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report multiwavelength and multipoint observations of the prominence eruption originating from active region 11163, which generated an M3.5 class flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2011 February 24. The prominence lifts off and propagates nonradially in the southeast direction. Using the revised cone model, we carry out three-dimensional reconstructions of the icecream-like prominence. The latitudinal inclination angle decreases from $\sim$60$\degr$ to $\sim$37$\degr$, indicating that the prominence tends to propagate more radially. The longitudinal inclination angle almost keeps constant (-6$\degr$). The highly inclined prominence eruption and the related CME drive an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave, which propagates southward at speeds of $\sim$381.60 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$398.59 km s$^{-1}$ observed in 193 {\AA} and 304 {\AA}, respectively. The M3.5 class flare presents quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in soft X-ray, hard X-ray, EUV, and radio wavelengths with periods of 80$-$120 s. Cotemporary with the flare QPPs, a thin current sheet and multiple plasmoids are observed following the eruptive prominence. Combining with the appearance of drifting pulsation structure, the QPPs are most probably generated by quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection and particle accelerations as a result of plasmoids in the current sheet.</description>

      <title>Ion-scale Turbulence and Energy Cascade Rate in the Solar Corona and Inner Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence cascading from MHD to kinetic scales in the heliospheric plasma is believed to play a key role in coronal heating and fast solar wind acceleration, but the properties of the turbulence remain poorly constrained by observations. Here we compare the ion-scale density fluctuation levels inferred from the properties of solar radio bursts with the magnetic field fluctuation levels obtained through in-situ measurements in the inner heliosphere. We find that the observed magnetic and density fluctuation amplitudes are consistent with excitation by kinetic Alfv\'en waves and/or KAW structures over broad range of distances from the Sun. We then use the radio diagnostics and the KAW scenario to deduce the radial variation of magnetic fluctuation amplitudes in regions close to the Sun where in-situ measurements cannot be obtained. Further, we calculate the energy cascade rate (plasma heating rate) profile over a region that extends from the low corona ($\sim 0.1$~R$_\odot$) into the heliosphere (out to $\sim 1$~au), and compare it to the energy deposition rate required to drive the solar wind. The cascade rate agrees with the available in-situ measurements and also provides predictions closer than $\sim 10$~R$_\odot$ where in-situ approaches are not available. The results provide unique diagnostics of the ion-scale plasma turbulence amplitude and energy cascade rate spanning over three orders of magnitude in solar distance.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Convective Kissing Instability in Cataclysmic Variable Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convective kissing instability (CKI) is postulated to occur in low mass stars around the fully convective transition. Non-equilibrium $^{3}$He burning leads to the merging of core and envelope convective zones, which causes abrupt decreases in the stellar radius. It has been suggested by van Saders &amp; Pinsonneault (2012) that these effects may be relevant for cataclysmic variables (CVs). We have performed stellar evolution modeling to study the role of the CKI in CV evolution. We find that the CKI has no effect on normal CVs which evolve via magnetic braking and gravitational radiation above the period gap. CKI cycles either do not occur or are abruptly halted once mass transfer begins. If only gravitational radiation is considered, the CKI does occur. The abrupt radius changes can cause detachment phases which produce small period gaps with widths of a few minutes. We describe how the size of the period gaps is controlled by the $^{3}$He profiles of the secondaries. We also discuss how the results of this study apply to the evolution of strong field polars, where the magnetic field of the white dwarf is strong enough to suppress magnetic braking.</description>

      <title>Chromaticity of stellar activity in radial velocities : Anti-correlated families of lines on the M dwarf EV Lac with SPIRou and SOPHIE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In the search for exoplanets using radial velocities (RV), stellar activity has become one of the main limiting factors for detectability. Fortunately, activity-induced RV signals are wavelength-dependent or chromatic, unlike planetary signals. This study exploits the broad spectral coverage provided by the combined use of SOPHIE and SPIRou velocimeters to investigate the chromatic nature of the activity signal of the highly active M dwarf EV Lac.
  Aims. We aim to understand the origin of the strong wavelength dependence (chromaticity) observed in the RV signal of EV Lac by selecting spectral lines based on physical properties. In particular, we explore the impact of starspots by defining the contrast effect at the level of individual lines. The Zeeman effect is also considered in this study.
  Methods. SPIRou and SOPHIE spectra were reduced using the line-by-line (LBL) method. We performed custom RV calculations, using groups of spectral lines selected for their sensitivity to either the spot-to-photosphere contrast or the Zeeman effect. The sensi- tivity of each line to the spot is defined using a two-temperature model based on PHOENIX spectra, while Land\'e factors were used to quantify Zeeman sensitivity.
  Results. We find that the spectral lines are distributed in two distinct families of contrasts, producing anti-correlated RV signals. This leads to a partial cancellation of the total RV signal, especially at longer wavelengths and provides a natural explanation for the strong chromaticity observed in EV Lac. This sign-reversal effect is demonstrated here, for the first time, on empirical data. Building on this discovery, we propose a new approach to constraining spot temperatures and to mitigating stellar activity. This will open up promising avenues for improving activity corrections and enhancing the detection of exoplanets around active M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Impact of nonthermal electron distributions on the triggering of the ion-ion acoustic instability near the Sun: Kinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In a previous paper (Afify et al. 2024), we have investigated the stability threshold of the ion-ion acoustic instability (IIAI) in parameter regimes compatible with recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP, (Fox et al. 2016)) observations, in the presence of a Maxwellian electron distribution. We found that observed parameters are close to the instability threshold, but IIAI requires a higher electron temperature than observed. Aims. As electron distributions in the solar wind present clear non-Maxwellian features, we investigate here if deviations from the Maxwellian distribution could explain the observed IIAI. We address specifically the kappa ( $\kappa$ ) and core-strahl distributions for the electrons. Methods. We perform analytical studies and kinetic simulations using a Vlasov-Poisson code in a parameter regime relevant to PSP observations. The simulated growth rates are validated against kinetic theory. Results. We show that the IIAI threshold changes in the presence of $\kappa$ or core-strahl electron distributions, but not significantly. In the latter case, the expression of an effective temperature for an equivalent Maxwellian electron distribution given in Jones et al. (1975) is confirmed by simulations. Such an effective temperature could simplify stability assessment of future observations.</description>

      <title>Simulated 3D $^{56}$Ni Distributions of Type IIp Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional study of the asymptotic ejecta distributions for a suite of theoretical Type IIp supernovae originating from red supergiant progenitors. We simulate using the radiation-hydrodynamic code F{\sc{ornax}} from core bounce through the first seconds of the neutrino-driven explosion and then follow using a hydrodynamic variant of the code FLASH until shock breakout of the star and through to homologous expansion of the ejecta into the circumstellar environment. Our studied progenitor models range from 9 to 25 M$_{\odot}$, with explosion energies spanning $\sim$0.1$-$1 Bethe. The shock breakout times span the range $\sim$1$-$4 days, with a breakout time spread by direction ranging from hours to over a day. We find that the dipole orientation of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta is well-preserved from the first seconds out to shock breakout. The $^{56}$Ni ejecta penetrates through the initially outer oxygen shell, and its global structure is imprinted with small-scale clumping as the ejecta evolve through the stellar envelope. For the majority of our models, the neutron star kick is anti-aligned with the $^{56}$Ni ejecta. Models with strongly dipolar ejecta morphology and a massive hydrogen/helium envelope with an inner boundary located deep see as much as $\sim$70\% of the $^{56}$Ni ejecta mixed into that outer envelope, reaching asymptotic velocities ranging from $\sim$350 to 3200 km s$^{-1}$. Supernovae arising from red supergiant progenitors and exhibiting prominent nickel features generally display significant $^{56}$Ni mixing into the stellar envelope.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Life of Stars: Embedded Beginnings to AGB Endings in the PHANGS-JWST Sample. I. Catalog of Mid-IR Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength catalog of mid-infrared-selected compact sources in 19 nearby galaxies, combining JWST NIRCam/MIRI, HST UV-optical broadband, H$\alpha$ narrow-band, and ALMA CO observations. We detect 24,945 compact sources at 21 $\mu$m and 55,581 at 10 $\mu$m. Artificial star tests show 50% completeness limits of $\sim$5 $\mu$Jy for the 10 $\mu$m catalog, and $\sim$24 $\mu$Jy for the 21 $\mu$m catalog. We find that 21 $\mu$m compact sources contribute $\sim$20% of the total galaxy emission in that band, but only contribute $5%$ at 10 $\mu$m. We classify sources using stellar evolution and population synthesis models combined with empirical classifications derived from the literature.Our classifications include H$\alpha$-bright and dust-embedded optically faint clusters, red supergiants (RSGs), oxygen-rich and carbon-rich AGB stars, and a range of rarer stellar types.In sampling a broad range of star forming environments with a uniform, well-characterized selection, this catalog enables enables analyses of infrared-bright stellar populations. We find that H$\alpha$-faint sources account for only 10% of dusty (likely young) clusters, implying that the infrared-bright, optically-faint phase of cluster evolution is short compared to the H$\alpha$-bright stage. The luminosity functions of 10 and 21 $\mu$m sources follow power-law distributions, with the 21 $\mu$m slope ($-1.7 \pm 0.1$) similar to that of giant molecular cloud mass functions and ultraviolet bright star-forming complexes, while the 10 $\mu$m slope ($-2.0 \pm 0.1$) is closer to that of young stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging for the Debris Disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the inner debris disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani using simulated observations with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C). Using the radiative transfer code MCFOST, we generate synthetic scattered-light images and spectral energy distributions for three disk models that differ in inclination and radial extent, and compare these results with the anticipated performance of CPI-C. CPI-C can resolve disk structures down to $\sim$3 au, offering substantially finer spatial resolution than existing HST/STIS and Spitzer/IRS observations. Recovered inclinations and radial extents closely match the input models, constraining the disk geometry and informing potential planet-disk interactions in the $\epsilon$ Eri system. Although the cold Jupiter-like planet $\epsilon$ Eri b is not detected in our simulations, polarimetric methods may enable detection of its reflected light. These results highlight the capability of next-generation coronagraphs to probe cold dust in nearby planetary systems.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Turbulence at Sub-Electron Scales in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\rho_e$ scales.</description>

      <title>First large scale spatial and velocity patterns of local metal-rich stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) The present-day spatial and kinematic distribution of stars in the Milky Way provides key constraints on its internal dynamics and evolutionary history. We select stars that are more metal-rich than the interstellar medium (ISM) at their guiding radius (the so-called Local Metal-Rich stars, LMR) and investigate their chemo-kinematics. Until recently, existing catalogues did not contain such targets in large quantities, but one can now select many millions of them by using Gaia photometric metallicities. Once selected, we investigate their kinematics and age distributions across the disc, and compare them to the stellar populations having the metallicity of the ISM.
  Compared to locally born stars with [M/H]=[M/H]_ISM, we find that LMR stars, at a given location, are always older (mean age up to 2 Gyr older) and with velocity dispersions similar or slightly higher. Furthermore, at a given [M/H], LMR stars are older at larger galactocentric radiii, reflecting the fact that they need time to migrate. Finally, whereas we do not find any correlation between the location of the spiral arms and the spatial density of LMR stars, we find that the mean stellar eccentricity and mean ages show smaller values where the spiral arms are.
  Our results confirm a well established theoretical result that has not yet been formally confirmed via observations on large datasets without modelling: churning is not significantly heating the Galactic disc. Furthermore, the age distribution of these stars rule-out any significant contribution from Galactic fountains as their origin, and confirm the effect of the spiral arms on them.</description>

      <title>Probing dust and grain growth in the optically thick circumbinary ring of V892 Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A considerable proportion of young stars belong to multiple star systems. Constraining the planet formation processes in multiple stellar systems is then key to understand the global exoplanet population. This study focuses on investigating the dust reservoir within the triple system V892 Tau. Our objective is to establish constraints on the properties and characteristics of the dust present in the system's circumbinary ring. Based on archival ALMA and VLA data from 0.9 mm to 9.8 mm, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the ring of V892 Tau. We first studied the spatial variation of the spectral index, before employing 3D full radiative transfer calculations to constrain the ring's geometry and the radial dependence of the dust grain properties. Spectral indices are consistent with non-dust emission in the vicinity of the central binary, and with dust emission in the ring likely remaining optically thick up to 3.0 mm. Our radiative transfer analysis supports these interpretations, yielding a model that reproduces the observed intensities within the 1-sigma uncertainties across all wavelengths. The resulting dust surface density and temperature profiles both decrease with increasing radius, and are in agreement with values reported in the literature. Maximum grain sizes are constrained to 0.2 cm, with a size distribution power-law index -3.5. These results imply that the dust grain fragmentation velocity does not exceed 8 m/s. Whilst our results suggest dust trapping at the cavity edge, they also suggest that tidal perturbations triggered by the central binary limit grain growth within the ring. This highlights the need to further constrain planet formation efficiency in multiple stellar systems, a goal that may be advanced by applying the methodology of this work to a wider sample of systems.</description>

      <title>The young stellar clusters in M51 and the impact of GMC encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the young stellar cluster population of M51 and how it is affected by encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We combine a galactic model with $N$-body simulations of 5000 unique clusters in the mass range [600 - 24000] $M_{\odot}$. We simulate each cluster twice: with ($C_R$) and without ($C_N$) tidal perturbations from the GMCs. We are able to reproduce the majority of the observed mass- and age functions. However, for the age function we see a large discrepancy for clusters with masses $\sim$ 5000 $M_{\odot}$, which is likely related to incompleteness in the observations. We find that old low-mass clusters, located close to the galactic centre, are most likely to be disrupted. The effect of GMC encounters causes a decrease in survivability by 8 per cent points for the oldest clusters with initial masses below 6000 $M_{\odot}$. For 15 clusters we find that the presence of GMCs can protect the $C_R$ clusters from the rest of the galactic tidal field and thereby cause them to retain a significantly higher fraction of stars compared to the $C N$ clusters. For clusters that are super-virialized we find that the $C_R$ clusters have a higher virial ratio compared to the $C_N$ clusters, which is a result of interactions with GMCs. We see no significant difference between the $C_R$ and $C_N$ populations, indicating that over a time period of 200 Myr the effect of the GMCs cannot be detected.</description>

      <title>Observation-Based Iterative Map for Solar Cycles. II. The Gnevyshev-Ohl Rule and its Generation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gnevyshev-Ohl (G-O) rule, or even-odd effect, is an important observational phenomenon in solar cycles, originally suggesting that even-numbered cycles are typically followed by stronger odd-numbered ones. However, subsequent studies have reported varied forms and often conflicting manifestations of this rule, along with diverse interpretations of its physical origin. Using an observation-based iterative map, we investigate these different forms of the G-O rule and propose a more general underlying rule: statistically, a given solar cycle is more likely to be followed by a stronger one, regardless of even-odd numbering. This transition asymmetry arises from the map's inherent asymmetry relative to the diagonal. Over timescales comparable to historical observations, both the G-O rule and its reversal can arise randomly, without a consistent preference. The short-term behavior of the rule is sensitive to the initial cycle, the selected time interval, and the parameters of the recursion function. These findings reconcile previously conflicting reports and point to a general generation mechanism: G-O-like behavior arises naturally from nonlinear stochastic dynamics. While different recursion parameters may lead to varying short-term patterns and statistical strengths, the emergence of G-O-like features appears to be a generic property of such systems.</description>

      <title>ATOMIUM: Continuum emission and evidence of dust enhancement from binary motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) account for a significant portion of the dust and chemical enrichment in their host galaxy. Here we present ALMA observations of the continuum emission at 1.24 mm around a sample of 17 stars from the ATOMIUM survey. From our analysis of the stellar contributions to the continuum flux, we find that the semi-regular variables all have smaller physical radii and fainter monochromatic luminosities than the Mira variables. Comparing these properties with pulsation periods, we find a positive trend between stellar radius and period only for the Mira variables with periods above 300 days and a positive trend between the period and the monochromatic luminosity only for the red supergiants and the most extreme AGB stars with periods above 500 days. We find that the continuum emission at 1.2 mm can be classified into four groups. "Featureless" continuum emission is confined to the (unresolved) regions close to the star for five stars in our sample, relatively uniform extended flux is seen for four stars, tentative elongated features are seen for three stars, and the remaining five stars have unique or unusual morphological features in their continuum maps. These features can be explained by binary companions to 10 out of the 14 AGB stars in our sample. Based on our results we conclude that there are two modes of dust formation: well established pulsation-enhanced dust formation and our newly proposed companion-enhanced dust formation. If the companion is located close to the AGB star, in the wind acceleration region, then additional dust formed in the wake of the companion can increase the mass lost through the dust driven wind. This explains the different dust morphologies seen around our stars and partly accounts for a large scatter in literature mass-loss rates, especially among semiregular stars with small pulsation periods.</description>

      <title>Evidence that Mass Loss on the Red Giant Branch Decreases with Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) influences stellar evolution, properties of stellar populations, and Galactic chemical enrichment, yet remains poorly constrained observationally. Current models provide limited insight into how stellar properties, particularly how metallicity and mass, affect RGB mass loss. Here, I introduce a new observational approach that uses the age-velocity-dispersion relation and the lower-mass boundary of red giants as precise evolutionary markers. These markers, informed by Galactic evolution, allow us to construct observational isochrones for field stars. By comparing masses of RGB stars and red clump (RC) stars at the same age in the Kepler sample, I derive empirical measurements of integrated RGB mass loss at several points in age and metallicity. Combining these new observational measurements with open-cluster studies, I showed that the integrated mass loss on the RGB decreases with metallicity, and may also decrease with stellar mass. The average mass-loss rate, which accounts for RGB lifetimes and the initial mass differences between RGB and RC stars at the same age, also shows a similar trend. These findings challenge current mass-loss prescriptions widely adopted in stellar evolutionary models, since none of them is able to produce the observed mass-loss trend without widely adjusting free parameters. This highlights an urgent need to revise mechanisms that govern RGB mass loss.</description>

      <title>Metallicities from High-Resolution TRES Spectra with uberMS: Performance Benchmarks and Literature Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the field of exoplanetary astronomy has matured, demand has grown for precise stellar abundances to probe subtle correlations between stellar compositions and planetary demographics. However, drawing population-level conclusions from the disparate measurements in the literature is challenging, with various groups measuring metallicities using bespoke codes with differing line lists, radiative transfer models, and other assumptions. Homogeneous analyses are thus critical. Here we use the neural-net framework uberMS to measure iron abundances and alpha enrichments from high-resolution optical spectra observed by the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), a key resource used for the follow-up of candidate exoplanet hosts. To contextualize these measurements and benchmark our method's performance, we compare to external constraints on metallicity using the Hyades cluster, wide binaries, and asteroids, to external constraints on $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ using stars with interferometric radii, and to the results of other abundance measurement methods using overlap samples with the APOGEE and SPOCS catalogs, as well as by applying the SPC method directly to TRES spectra. We find that TRES-uberMS provides reliable parameter estimates with errors of roughly 100 K in $T_{\rm eff}$, 0.09 dex in $\log g$, and 0.04 dex in [Fe/H] for many nearby dwarf stars, although [Fe/H] performance is poorer for mid-to-late K dwarfs, with the bias worsening with decreasing $T_{\rm eff}$. Performance is also worse for evolved stars. For [$\alpha$/Fe], our error may be as good as 0.03 dex for dwarfs based on external benchmarks, despite sizable and variable systematic differences when comparing with specific alpha-element abundances from other catalogs.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Radio Survey. II. Radio Emission from High-Luminosity Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present centimeter continuum observations of seven high luminosity massive protostars and their surrounding sources in regions with multiple targets, as part of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey. With data from the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyze the spectral index, morphology and multiplicity of the detected radio sources. The high-sensitivity, high-resolution observations allow us to resolve many sources; 65$\%$ of the reported sources are resolved at least within the synthesized beam. We report thirteen new detections and two previously known detections that we observed for the first time in radio frequencies. We use the observations to build radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to calculate spectral indices. With radio morphologies and the spectral indices, we give assessments on the nature of the sources, highlighting six sources that display a radio jet-like morphology and a spectral index consistent with ionized jets. Combining with the SOMA Radio I sample, we present the radio - bolometric luminosity relation, especially probing the regime from $L_{\rm bol}\sim 10^4$ to $10^6\:L_\odot$. Here we find a steep rise in radio luminosity, which is expected by models that transition from shock ionization to photoionization.</description>

      <title>From the light curves of Long Period Variables to their evolution along the AGB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sample of 116 Long Period Variables is studied with the aim to reveal relations between the properties of their light curves and of their evolution along the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Each light curve is carefully scrutinized and its properties are summarized in a set of five parameters. One of these, which measures the relative width of the light maxima and minima, is found to be particularly efficient at revealing significant correlations with the current state of the star on the AGB. The picture that had been sketched in an earlier work is clarified and new features are revealed. In particular, the evolution on the AGB of stars having not yet experienced a third dredge-up event is shown to go together with a closely related path followed by the light curve in the parameter space. Moreover, evidence is found for the existence of two different types of light curves for stars having experienced dredge-up events strong enough for their impact to be detectable. For some, probably associated with higher initial mass stars, the light maximum becomes broader as the star evolves along the AGB, while for others it becomes narrower. Interpretations are proposed, however often too speculative to be firmly ascertained: the results presented raise several unanswered questions and point to the need for new observations and analyses, suggesting that light curves still carry more messages and information than has been currently possible to decrypt.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruption of White Dwarfs in off-equatorial orbits around Kerr black holes</title>

Abstract: We present the results of a suite of numerical simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics to study partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white dwarfs (WDs) in off-equatorial orbits in intermediate mass spinning (Kerr) black hole backgrounds. We carry out this analysis for both parabolic and eccentric WD orbits and also take into account possible initial WD spins. Our objective here is to quantify the differences in variables like the mass of the self-bound core, the peak fallback rate of debris and gravitational wave signature in off-equatorial orbits compared to equatorial ones. The analysis is carried out using a hybrid numerical scheme, one which involves integrating the exact Kerr geodesics while adopting a Newtonian formalism for the stellar fluid dynamics, justified by our choice of simulation parameters. We find that the physics of TDEs in off-equatorial orbits present several interesting and novel features due to black hole spin, which in some cases enhances when coupled with the rotation of the WD. However, numerical values of observable quantities in TDEs involving off-equatorial orbits cannot possibly distinguish between such orbits from equatorial ones. We further comment on the genericness of our results and argue that these should extend to a general TDE scenario involving a spinning BH.</description>

      <title>Toward A General Theory of Grain Alignment and Disruption by Radiative Torques and Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02157</link>

Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.</description>

      <title>Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channeling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the Lorentz force mediated interactions between coherent vortex structures in matter and the field. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.</description>
