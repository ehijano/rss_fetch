      <title>Performance of the Endcap Time-of-Flight detector in the STAR beam-energy scan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The STAR experiment at RHIC at Brookhaven National Laboratory completed the installation of an endcap time-of-flight subsystem (eTOF) in February 2019. The eTOF subsystem provided essential mid-rapidity particle identification (PID) for the fixed-target (FXT) portion of phase II of the beam energy scan (BES II). The FXT program allowed BES II to include center-of-mass energies from $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 3.0$ GeV to $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 7.7$ GeV, not accessible by colliding beams. The eTOF detectors and readout electronics were designed for the CBM experiment at FAIR and adapted for use at STAR. In this paper, we describe the details of the system in terms of geometrical layout, acceptance, calibration, hit reconstruction, and particle identification. The system achieved a time resolution of about 70 ps and a PID efficiency of about 70\%, meeting the design goals of the project.</description>

      <title>Measurement of ionization yield of low energy ions in low pressure $\mathrm{CF}_{4}$ gas for dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction-sensitive direct dark matter search experiments have been conducted using gaseous detectors. In spite of the long history of the study on the energy deposition of charged particles in materials, a full agreement between the measured results and theoretical predictions, especially in a low energy scale, are yet to be achieved. It is thus important to experimentally measure the ionization yields of recoil nuclei for the experiments with gaseous detectors using an ionization charge readout scheme. This study measured the ionization yield using a low-energy ion beam facility at Kanagawa University. The ionization yields for fluorine ions with an energy range of 5 $\sim$ 50 keV were measured using a dedicated proportional wire chamber filled with $\mathrm{CF}_{4}$ gas at 0.06 atm. The low-energy ion injection scheme into a gaseous detector was established and the ionization yield for fluorine ions was obtained to be 0.45 at 30 keV with a moderate dependence on the ion energy.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Direct Electron Detectors in Ultrafast Electron Scattering Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron diffraction and phonon-diffuse scattering (UED(S)) experiments make use of photo-induced changes to electron scattering intensity across 2D detectors to report on a very wide range of dynamic structural phenomena in molecules and materials. Compared to ultrafast spectroscopies, these techniques have very high structural-information content and competitive time-resolution, but sensitivity to relative changes in electron scattering intensity is orders of magnitude lower. Hybrid pixel counting detectors (HPCDs) are a promising technology for improved sensitivity and signal-to-noise in UED(S) experiments, as they offer near-zero readout noise and dark counts with the possibility of new acquisition modalities (e.g. shot-to-shot normalization) due to their high frame rates. However, it is well known that HPCDs suffer from count losses at high electron fluxes even in CW beam applications. How this translates to ultrashort electron pulse exposures has yet to be determined and is critical to understanding the application of this technology to ultrafast electron scattering experiments. Here we show that count losses are exacerbated significantly in ultrafast (pulsed) experiments and that HPCDs require count rates to be kept below $\approx 2$ electrons per pixel per pulse. This count-rate limitation presents a severe constraint on electron bunch charge when interrogating single crystal samples. A model for the electron counting uncertainties in HPCDs across the entire relevant range of average count rates is proposed, from which we derive experimental strategies to optimize data quality in UEDS using direct electron detectors. Finally, we suggest ways HPCDs could be better adapted to ultrashort pulsed beam experiments.</description>

      <title>Momentum Measurement of Charged Particles in FASER's Emulsion Detector at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a momentum measurement method based on multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) in the FASER$\nu$ emulsion detector. The measurement of charged-particle momenta is essential for studying neutrino interactions in the TeV energy range at the FASER experiment. This method exploits the sub-micron spatial resolution and long tracking length of the FASER$\nu$ detector, enabling momentum determination from a few GeV up to a few TeV. The performance was evaluated using Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations and validated with muon test beam data in the momentum range 100-300 GeV. As a first probe of the method for higher momentum muons, background muons recorded by the FASER$\nu$ detector were examined, showing reconstructed momenta consistent with expectations from their angular spread.</description>

      <title>Radiological mapping and uncertainty quantification by a fast Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiological mapping plays a critical role in nuclear emergency response and environmental management activities. A radiation image, representing the spatial and intensity distribution of the radioactivity, is reconstructed from the radiation data and associated contextual information. Typical image reconstruction methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Expectation-Maximization (ML-EM), only provide point estimates of the pixel or voxel activities without associated uncertainties. Here, we apply a new Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) sampler for radiation image reconstruction and uncertainty quantification. The MCLMC sampler properties are first tested with synthetic radiation images. Methods to obtain the radiation distribution estimate and the associated uncertainty from the samples drawn by MCLMC are discussed. Given sufficient measurement statistics, the radiation distribution estimate obtained from MCLMC results closely resembles the ground truth with less risk of over- or under-fitting compared to ML-EM. When MCLMC is run in parallel on a GPU, it can converge in about 10 seconds for an image with $10^3$--$10^4$ pixels, which is significantly faster than other comparable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. We also tested MCLMC on a dataset from a real distributed source radiological mapping campaign, and the reconstructed results agree well with ground truth. The fast MCLMC sampler therefore enables improved imaging accuracy and prompt uncertainty quantification for reconstructed radiation images, which can better inform decision-making in response to radiological events.</description>

      <title>Power attenuation in millimeter-wave and terahertz superconducting rectangular waveguides: linear response, TLS loss, and Higgs-mode nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $\alpha$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\ll\xi_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\gg\xi_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $\alpha$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 \Delta/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsim\xi_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $\alpha$ near $f\simeq \Delta/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.</description>

      <title>Modeling the light response of an optically readout GEM based TPC for the CYGNO experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of gaseous Time Projection Chambers enables the detection and the detailed study of rare events due to particles interactions with the atoms of the gas with energy releases as low as a few keV. Due to this capability, these instruments are being developed for applications in the field of astroparticle physics, such as the study of dark matter and neutrinos. To readout events occurring in the sensitive volume with a high granularity, the CYGNO collaboration is developing a solution where the light generated during the avalanche processes occurring in a multiplication stage based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is read out by optical sensors with very high sensitivity and spatial resolution. To achieve a high light output, gas gain values of the order of $10^5\text{-}10^6$ are needed. Experimentally, a dependence of the detector response on the spatial density of the charge collected in the GEM holes has been observed, indicating a gain-reduction effect likely caused by space-charge buildup within the multiplication channels. This paper presents data collected with a prototype featuring a sensitive volume of about two liters, together with a model developed by the collaboration to describe and predict the gain dependence on charge density. A comparison with experimental data shows that the model accurately reproduces the gain behaviour over nearly one order of magnitude, with a percent-level precision.</description>

      <title>Design and characterization of a photosensor system for the RELICS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and characterization of a photosensor system developed for the RELICS experiment. An extended dynamic range base was designed to mitigate photomultiplier tube (PMT) saturation caused by intense cosmic muon backgrounds in the surface-level RELICS detector. The system employs dual readout from the anode and the seventh dynode to extend the linear response range of the PMT. In particular, our characterization and measurements of Hamamatsu R8520-406 PMTs confirm stable operation under positive high-voltage bias, extending the linear response range by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, a model of PMT saturation and recovery was developed to evaluate the influence of cosmic muon signals in the RELICS detector. The results demonstrate the system capability to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering signals under surface-level cosmic backgrounds, and suggest the potential to extend the scientific reach of RELICS to MeV-scale interactions.</description>
