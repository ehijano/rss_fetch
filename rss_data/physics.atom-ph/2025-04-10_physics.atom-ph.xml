      <title>Probing dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms and ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe resonant dipolar interactions between ultracold $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb molecules and Rydberg $^{87}$Rb atoms in an optically trapped ensemble. Through state-selective ionization detection of the KRb molecules, we observe resonant energy transfer at 2.227 GHz from Rydberg atoms to molecules under a tunable external electric field. We measure a broadening up to 3.5 MHz, for the Rb Rydberg excitation spectrum, which matches a Monte Carlo simulation that describes a Rydberg atom and neighboring molecules evolving under a dipole-dipole interacting Hamiltonian. The demonstrated interspecies dipolar interaction is a key ingredient for hybrid Rydberg-polar molecule systems, where the advantages of each system can be leveraged and combined.</description>

      <title>Low-latency control system for feedback experiments with optical tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and characterize a modular, open-source system to perform feedback control experiments on configurations of atoms and molecules in arrays of optical tweezers. The system features a modular, cost-effective computer architecture with a motherboard and peripheral cards. It supports efficient data transfer to and from graphics processing units (GPUs) using Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), leveraging GPU efficiency in matrix multiplication and parallelism, while enabling direct data transfer between devices without involving the CPU. We first describe the architecture and workflow of the system, detailing its hardware components and software modules. We then evaluate the computational runtime for preparing defect-free chains and grids of atoms using efficient implementations of atom reconfiguration algorithms. Finally, we discuss timing bottlenecks and strategies to reduce latency. Beyond solving reconfiguration problems, the system can readily be used to implement adaptive and feedforward protocols, as well as digital quantum algorithms relying on particle displacement. Our results lay the groundwork for developing low-latency feedback control systems, benchmarking their performance, and advancing scalable quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic recombination studies of ions relevant to kilonovae and non-LTE plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents calculations of rate coefficients, resonance strengths, and cross sections for the dielectronic recombination (DR) of Y^+, Sr^+, Te^2+, and Ce^2+--low-charge ions relevant to kilonovae and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) plasmas. Using relativistic atomic structure methods, we computed DR rate coefficients under conditions typical of these environments. Our results highlight the critical role of low-lying DR resonances in shaping rate coefficients at kilonova temperatures (~ 10^4 K) and regulating charge-state distributions. Pronounced near-threshold DR resonances significantly influence the evolving ionization states and opacity of neutron star merger ejecta. Comparisons with previous studies emphasize the necessity of including high-n Rydberg states for accurate DR rate coefficients, especially for complex heavy ions with dense energy levels. Discrepancies with existing datasets underscore the need for refined computational techniques to minimize uncertainties. These results provide essential input for interpreting spectroscopic observations of neutron star mergers, including James Webb Space Telescope data. We also put forward suitable candidates for experimental studies, recognizing the challenges involved in such measurements. The data presented here have potential to refine models of heavy-element nucleosynthesis, enhance plasma simulation accuracy, and improve non-LTE plasma modeling in astrophysical and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Consensus-based qubit configuration optimization for variational algorithms on neutral atom quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report an algorithm that is able to tailor qubit interactions for individual variational quantum algorithm problems. Here, the algorithm leverages the unique ability of a neutral atom tweezer platform to realize arbitrary qubit position configurations. These configurations determine the degree of entanglement available to a variational quantum algorithm via the interatomic interactions. Good configurations will accelerate pulse optimization convergence and help mitigate barren plateaus. As gradient-based approaches are ineffective for position optimization due to the divergent $R^{-6}$ nature of neutral atom interactions, we opt to use a consensus-based algorithm to optimize the qubit positions. By sampling the configuration space instead of using gradient information, the consensus-based algorithm is able to successfully optimize the positions, yielding adapted variational quantum algorithm ansatzes that lead to both faster convergence and lower errors. In this work, we show that these optimized configurations generally result in large improvements in the system's ability to solve ground state minimization problems for both random Hamiltonians and small molecules.</description>

      <title>VQE calculations on a NISQ era trapped ion quantum computer using a multireference unitary coupled cluster ansatz: application to the BeH$_2$ insertion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with a multireference unitary coupled cluster ansatz to report the ground state energy of the BeH$_2$ molecule in a geometry where strong correlation effects are significant. We consider the two most important determinants in the construction of the reference state for our ansatz. Furthermore, in order to carry out our intended 12-qubit computation on a noisy intermediate scale quantum era trapped ion hardware (the commercially available IonQ Forte-I), we perform a series of resource reduction techniques to a. decrease the number of two-qubit gates by 99.84% (from 12515 to 20 two-qubit gates) relative to the unoptimized circuit, and b. reduce the number of measurements via the idea of supercliques, while losing 2.69% in the obtained ground state energy (with error mitigation and post-selection) relative to that computed classically for the same resource-optimized problem setting.</description>

      <title>The ground electronic state of CS: the potential curve and associated Born-Oppenheimer rovibrational spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Basics of the Born-Oppenheimer (B-O) approximation are reviewed. Assuming the domain of applicability of B-O approximation is limited to 4 significant digits (s.d.) in energy spectrum, where mass, relativistic and QED corrections do NOT contribute, it is shown that for carbon monosulfide ${\rm C}\,{\rm S}$ the potential curve $V(R)$ for the electronic ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ can be constructed analytically in the form of two-point Pade approximant $\frac{1}{R}\ P(5,10)(R)$ in the whole range of internuclear distances $R \in [0,\infty)$. Pade approximant is fixed by taking into account the turning points with 4 s.d. accuracy, found by Coxon and Hajigeorgiou (2023), and asymptotics at small and large internuclear distances,
  By solving two-body radial nuclear Schr\"odinger equation with the potential $V(R)$ (with standard centrifugal potential included) in the Lagrange Mesh method, the whole B-O rovibrational spectrum for ${}^{12} {\rm C}\,{}^{32} {\rm S}$ diatomic molecule (taken as a particular example) is found: the $\sim 14562$ rovibrational energy states with angular momentum $L_{max}=289$ and vibrational quantum number $\nu_{max} \sim 82$ with accuracy $\sim 10^{-4}$ hartree in energy. It is shown that the experimentally observed transition energies are reproduced within 3-5 s.d. Critical analysis of existing theoretical (phenomenological) results on the rovibrational spectrum is carried out and its comparison with present ones is made.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Rydberg Blockade via Microwave Dressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental control over the strength and angular dependence of interactions between atoms is a key capability for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we use microwave dressing to manipulate and enhance Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in an atomic ensemble. By varying the cloud length relative to the blockade radius and measuring the statistics of the light retrieved from the ensemble, we demonstrate a clear enhancement of the interaction strength due to microwave dressing. These results are successfully captured by a theoretical model that accounts for the excitation dynamics, atomic density distribution, and the phase-matched retrieval efficiency. Our approach offers a versatile platform for further engineering interactions by exploiting additional features of the microwave fields, such as polarization and detuning, opening pathways for new quantum control strategies.</description>

      <title>H, He-like recombination spectra VI: Quadrupole $l$-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Search with a Resonantly-Coupled Hybrid Spin System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in tabletop quantum sensor technology have enabled searches for nongravitational interactions of dark matter (DM). Traditional axion DM experiments rely on sharp resonance, resulting in extensive scanning time to cover a wide mass range. In this work, we present a broadband approach in an alkali-${}^{21}$Ne spin system. We identify two distinct hybrid spin-coupled regimes: a self-compensation (SC) regime at low frequencies and a hybrid spin resonance (HSR) regime at higher frequencies. By utilizing these two distinct regimes, we significantly enhance the bandwidth of ${}^{21}$Ne nuclear spin compared to conventional nuclear magnetic resonance, while maintaining competitive sensitivity. We present a comprehensive broadband search for axion-like dark matter, covering 5 orders of magnitude of Compton frequencies range within $[10^{-2}, \, 10^3]$ Hz. We set new constraints on the axion dark matter interactions with neutrons and protons, accounting for the effects of DM stochasticity. For the axion-neutron coupling, our results reach a low value of $|g_{ann}|\le 3\times 10^{-10}$ in the frequency range $[2\times 10^{-2}, \, 4]$ Hz surpassing astrophysical limits and providing the strongest laboratory constraints in the $[10, \, 100]$ Hz range. For the axion-proton coupling, we offer the best terrestrial constraints for the frequency ranges $[2\times 10^{-2}, \, 5]$Hz and $[16, \, 7\times 10^{2}]$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Active laser cooling of a centimeter-scale torsional oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental tests of gravity's fundamental nature call for mechanical systems in the quantum regime while being sensitive to gravity. Torsion pendula, historically vital in studies of classical gravity, are ideal for extending gravitational tests into the quantum realm due to their inherently high mechanical quality factor, even when mass-loaded. Here, we demonstrate laser cooling of a centimeter-scale torsional oscillator to a temperature of 10 mK (average occupancy of 6000 phonons) starting from room temperature. This is achieved by optical radiation pressure forces conditioned on a quantum-noise-limited optical measurement of the torsional mode with an imprecision 9.8 dB below its peak zero-point motion. The measurement sensitivity is the result of a novel `mirrored' optical lever that passively rejects extraneous spatial-mode noise by 60 dB. The high mechanical quality ($1.4\times 10^7$) and quantum-noise-limited measurement imprecision demonstrate the necessary ingredients for realizing the quantum ground state of torsional motion -- a pre-requisite for mechanical tests of gravity's alleged quantum nature.</description>

      <title>Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic $^{23}$Na and fermionic $^6$Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle $g^{(2)}$ correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of $g^{(2)}$ for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.</description>
