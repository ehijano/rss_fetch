      <title>EQNN: Enhanced Quantum Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Matrix representation of the resolvent operator in square-integrable basis and physical application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain simple formulas for the matrix elements of the resolvent operator (the Green's function) in any finite set of square integrable basis. These formulas are suitable for numerical computations whether the basis elements are orthogonal or not. A byproduct of our findings is an expression for the normalized eigenvectors of a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues. We give a physical application as an illustration of how useful these results can be.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Scalability of Circuit Cutting Techniques for Practical Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit cutting allows quantum circuits larger than the available hardware to be executed. Cutting techniques split circuits into smaller subcircuits, run them on the hardware, and recombine results through classical post-processing. Circuit cutting techniques have been extensively researched over the last five years and it been adopted by major quantum hardware vendors as part of their scaling roadmaps. We examine whether current circuit cutting techniques are practical for orchestrating executions on fault-tolerant quantum computers. We conduct a resource estimation-based benchmarking of important quantum applications and different types of circuit cutting techniques. Our applications include practically relevant algorithms, such as Hamiltonian simulation, kernels such as quantum Fourier transform and more. To cut these applications, we use IBM's Qiskit cutting tool. We estimate resources for subcircuits using Microsoft's Azure Quantum Resource Estimator and develop models to determine the qubit, quantum and classical runtime needs of circuit cutting. We demonstrate that while circuit cutting works for small-scale systems, the exponential growth of the quantum runtime and the classical post-processing overhead as the qubit count increases renders it impractical for larger quantum systems with current implementation strategies. As we transition from noisy quantum hardware to fault-tolerance, our work provides important guidance for the design of quantum software and runtime systems.</description>

      <title>Reanalysis of Everett's relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Everett's "Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics" (RSQM), which appeared in Reviews of Modern Physics, is based on his thesis "The Theory of the Universal Wavefunction". The most noteworthy property of these works is the claim by other authors that these works are the seminal contribution to Many Worlds theories of branching realities and the claim that practical laboratory experimental tests of RSQM are not possible. This report shows that Everett's two works describe a formulation of quantum mechanics that contradicts an overwhelming body of experimental physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores as didactically as possible the fundamental principles of both classical and quantum metrology, focusing on the Cram\'er-Rao Bound and how it defines the maximum precision in parameter estimation, taking into account noise and the information extracted from the data. We also conduct a detailed study of Fisher Information (both classical and quantum), showing the physical significance of this important figure of merit in metrology. We further discuss how quantum states can surpass classical limits, providing much greater precision. Examples of technological applications include the development of quantum sensors, quantum thermometers, and phase parameter estimation. Finally, we review our results on the estimation of the unknown compression parameter applied to a mode of a quantum Gaussian state.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using time-dependent disorder in optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</description>

      <title>Partition function estimation with a quantum coin toss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating quantum partition functions is a critical task in a variety of fields. However, the problem is classically intractable in general due to the exponential scaling of the Hamiltonian dimension $N$ in the number of particles. This paper introduces a quantum algorithm for estimating the partition function $Z_\beta$ of a generic Hamiltonian $H$ up to multiplicative error based on a quantum coin toss. The coin is defined by the probability of applying the quantum imaginary-time evolution propagator $f_\beta[H]=e^{-\beta H/{2}}$ at inverse temperature $\beta$ to the maximally mixed state, realized by a block-encoding of $f_\beta[H]$ into a unitary quantum circuit followed by a post-selection measurement. Our algorithm does not use costly subroutines such as quantum phase estimation or amplitude amplification; and the binary nature of the coin allows us to invoke tools from Bernoulli-process analysis to prove a runtime scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N/{Z_\beta})$, quadratically better than previous general-purpose algorithms using similar quantum resources. Moreover, since the coin is defined by a single observable, the method lends itself well to quantum error mitigation. We test this in practice with a proof-of-concept 9-qubit experiment, where we successfully mitigate errors through a simple noise-extrapolation procedure. Our findings offer an interesting alternative for quantum partition function estimation relevant to early-fault quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>First result for testing semiclassical gravity effect with a torsion balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Newton equation, a theoretical framework connecting quantum mechanics with classical gravity, predicts that gravity may induce measurable deviations in low-frequency mechanical systems-an intriguing hypothesis at the frontier of fundamental physics. In this study, we developed and operated an advanced optomechanical platform to investigate these effects. The system integrates an optical cavity with finesse over 350000 and a torsion pendulum with an ultra-low eigenfrequency of 0.6mHz, achieving a high mechanical Q-factor exceeding 50000. We collected data for 3 months and reached a sensitivity of 0.3urad/rtHz at the Schr\"odinger-Newton frequency of 2.5mHz where deviations from the standard quantum mechanics may occur. While no evidence supporting semiclassical gravity was found, we identify key challenges in such tests and propose new experimental approaches to advance this line of inquiry. This work demonstrates the potential of precision optomechanics to probe the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>From quantum enhanced to quantum inspired Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic charging of open quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the adiabatic charging of a three-level QBs, using the adiabatic quantum master equation formalism. We restrict ourselves to the weak-coupling regime with an Ohmic thermal bath and investigate the effects of relaxation and dephasing on the charging process. We analyze the dependence of the stored energy, ergotropy as well as efficiency of QB on the total time of evolution $t_f$. We demonstrate that for very short charging time ($t_f$), where the evolution is highly non-adiabatic, the stored energy and ergotropy are very small. However, with increasing $t_f$ we show that there is an optimal charging time, $t_f^{opt}$, for maximum energy charging such that at low temperatures we could fully charge the battery and effectively extract the whole amount of energy from it. Note that, the optimal charging time could be decreased by adjusting strength of the coupling between system and environment and also appropriate choice of the Hamiltonian parameters which in turn speed up the charging process. On the other hand, we show that for very long charing time $t_f$ the charging energy, ergotropy and efficiency decrease due to thermal excitations. Furthermore to get more insights about the problem we investigate the distance between density matrix of system at optimal charging time $t_f^{opt}$ and the corresponding thermal state using one-norm distance.</description>

      <title>Driving Enhanced Exciton Transfer by Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model and study the processes of excitation, absorption, and transfer in various networks. The model consists of a harmonic oscillator representing a single-mode radiation field, a qubit acting as an antenna, a network through which the excitation propagates, and a qubit at the end serving as a sink. We investigate how off-resonant excitations can be optimally absorbed and transmitted through the network. Three strategies are considered: optimising network energies, adjusting the couplings between the radiation field, the antenna, and the network, or introducing and optimising driving fields at the start and end of the network. These strategies are tested on three different types of network with increasing complexity: nearest-neighbour and star configurations, and one associated with the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The results show that, among the various strategies, the introduction of driving fields is the most effective, leading to a significant increase in the probability of reaching the sink in a given time. This result remains stable across networks of varying dimensionalities and types, and the driving process requires only a few parameters to be effective.</description>

      <title>Kochen-Specker for many qubits and the classical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several arguments demonstrate the incompatibility between Quantum Mechanics and classical Physics. Bell's inequalities and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) arguments apply to specific non-classical states. The Kochen-Specker (KS) one, instead, is especially appealing for it applies to any state. Nevertheless, in spite of the incompatibility, quantum predictions must converge to classical ones as the macroscopic scale is approached. This convergence is known as "classical limit", and is difficult to explain within quantum formalism. In this short paper, the simplified Mermin-Peres form (two qubits) of the KS argument is extended to an arbitrary number of qubits. It is shown that quantum and classical predictions converge as the number of qubits is increases to the macroscopic scale. This way to explain the classical limit concurs with, and improves, a result previously reported for GHZ states. The demonstration for the general case (i.e., for all possible observables) that the classical limit is the consequence of merely increasing the number of particles, is important and seems to be at hand.</description>

      <title>Simulating Vibrational Dynamics on Bosonic Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum devices, which utilize harmonic oscillator modes to encode information, are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional qubit-based quantum devices, especially for the simulation of vibrational dynamics and spectroscopy. We present a framework for digital quantum simulation of vibrational dynamics under anharmonic potentials on these bosonic devices. In our approach the vibrational Hamiltonian is decomposed into solvable fragments that can be used for Hamiltonian simulation on currently available bosonic hardware. Specifically, we extended the Cartan subalgebra approach [T.C. Yen, A.F. Izmaylov, PRX Quantum 2, 040320 (2021)] -- a method for decomposing quantum Hamiltonians into solvable parts -- to bosonic operators, enabling us to construct anharmonic Hamiltonian fragments that can be efficiently diagonalized using Bogoliubov transforms. The approach is tested using a simulation of tunneling dynamics in a model two-dimensional double-well potential and calculations of vibrational eigenenergies for small molecules. Our fragmentation scheme provides a new approach for digital quantum simulations on bosonic quantum hardware for multi-mode anharmonic vibrational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of coherence contributions to a nonequilibrium thermodynamic process in a driven quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work done when a system at thermal equilibrium is externally driven by a unitary control parameter leads to irreversible entropy production. The entropy produced can be thought of as a combination of coherence generation and a population mismatch between the target equilibrium state and the actually achieved final state. We experimentally explored this out-of-equilibrium process in an NMR quantum processor and studied the contribution of coherence to irreversible entropy generation. We verified a generalized Clausius inequality, which affirms that irreversible entropy production is lower-bounded.</description>

      <title>Unextendible and strongly uncompletable product bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2003, DiVincenzo {\it et al}. put forward the question that whether there exists an unextendible product basis (UPB) which is an uncompletable product basis (UCPB) in every bipartition [\href{https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00220-003-0877-6}{DiVincenzo {\it et al}. Commun. Math. Phys. \textbf{238}, 379-410(2003)}]. Recently, Shi {\it et al}. presented a UPB in tripartite systems that is also a strongly uncompletable product basis (SUCPB) in every bipartition [\href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ac9e14}{Shi {\it et al}. New J. Phys. \textbf{24}, 113-025 (2022)}]. However, whether there exist UPBs that are SUCPBs in only one or two bipartitions remains unknown. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence of SUCPBs based on a quasi U-tile structure. We analyze all possible cases about the relationship between UPBs and SUCPBs in tripartite systems. In particular, we construct a UPB with smaller size $d^3-3d^2+1$ in $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$, which is an SUCPB in every bipartition and has a smaller cardinality than the existing one.</description>

      <title>Predicting Water Quality using Quantum Machine Learning: The Case of the Umgeni Catchment (U20A) Study Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a real-world application of QML techniques to study water quality in the U20A region in Durban, South Africa. Specifically, we applied the quantum support vector classifier (QSVC) and quantum neural network (QNN), and we showed that the QSVC is easier to implement and yields a higher accuracy. The QSVC models were applied for three kernels: Linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF), and it was shown that the polynomial and RBF kernels had exactly the same performance. The QNN model was applied using different optimizers, learning rates, noise on the circuit components, and weight initializations were considered, but the QNN persistently ran into the dead neuron problem. Thus, the QNN was compared only by accraucy and loss, and it was shown that with the Adam optimizer, the model has the best performance, however, still less than the QSVC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics is proved to admit no hidden-variable in 1960s, which means the quantum systems are contextual. Revealing the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is a significant task. We develop the approach of partial Boolean algebra to characterize the contextuality theory with local consistency and exclusivity, and then prove that the finite quantum systems are determined by atoms using two graph structure theorems. We also generalize our work to infinite cases. Our conclusions indicate that the quantum mechanics is a graph-structured combination of multiple hidden-variable theories, and provide a precise mathematical framework for quantum contextuality</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we developed an efficient quantum algorithm for the simulation of non-Markovian quantum dynamics, based on the Feynman path integral formulation. The algorithm scales polynomially with the number of native gates and the number of qubits, and has no classical overhead. It demonstrates the quantum advantage by overcoming the exponential cost on classical computers. In addition, the algorithm is efficient regardless of whether the temporal entanglement due to non-Markovianity is low or high, making it a unified framework for simulating non-Markovian dynamics in open quantum system.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit Controlled Teleportation across Distributed Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed work employs n instances of m-qubit GHZ states as the quantum resource to facilitate the teleportation of arbitrary n-qubit states among m participants, enabling the design of a teleportation protocol for distributed nodes across a network. The measurement operations of the sender are modified to ensure all measurements are local, and this modification is generalized to accommodate m participants in a 1-qubit teleportation protocol. Further extensions adapt the protocol to support n-qubit teleportation via m participants. Various configurations of the generalized protocol are explored, and the fidelity of teleportation is assessed through a comparative analysis of the Hinton diagrams of the input and output states.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of bosonic Gaussian thermal states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian thermal states form a fundamental class of states in quantum information science. This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures and Kubo-Mori information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.</description>

      <title>Discrete and parallel frequency-bin entanglement generation from quantum frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons' frequency degree of freedom is promising to realize large-scale quantum information processing. Quantum frequency combs (QFCs) generated in integrated nonlinear microresonators can produce multiple frequency modes with narrow linewidth. Here, we utilize polarization-entangled QFCs to generate discrete frequency-bin entangled states. Fourteen pairs of polarization-entangled photons with different frequencies are simultaneously transformed into frequency-bin entangled states. The characteristic of frequency-bin entanglement is demonstrated by Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, which can be performed with single or multiple frequency pairs in parallel. Our work paves the way for harnessing large-scale frequency-bin entanglement and converting between different degrees of freedom in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions of the open Jaynes-Cummings and quantum Rabi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings and quantum Rabi models are fundamental to cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics, as they describe the simplest form of light-matter interaction, where a single qubit is coupled to a single bosonic mode. A scenario that is commonly encountered in the experimental practice arises when the bosonic mode interacts with an external dissipative thermal bath, making the qubit-boson system open. In this work, we present new analytical solutions of the Lindblad master equations for the open Jaynes-Cummings and quantum Rabi models in the limit of weak qubit-boson coupling $g$, using the holomorphic formalism in Bargmann space. Specifically, we derive the most general solution of the local Lindblad master equation for the open dispersive Jaynes-Cummings model coupled to a thermal bath, with the only assumptions that the initial state of the qubit-boson system is separable. Additionally, we obtain a perturbative analytical solution for the open quantum Rabi model up to second order in $g$. Notably, our findings include a new formula for the qubit's steady state at zeroth order, showing that the stationary populations depend on both qubit and boson frequencies in the quantum Rabi model, but not in the Jaynes-Cummings model. Our results are of general interest to the study of open quantum systems in the context of light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Optimising Iteration Scheduling for Full-State Vector Simulation of Quantum Circuits on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the field of quantum computing grows, novel algorithms which take advantage of quantum phenomena need to be developed. As we are currently in the NISQ (noisy intermediate scale quantum) era, quantum algorithm researchers cannot reliably test their algorithms on real quantum hardware, which is still too limited. Instead, quantum computing simulators on classical computing systems are used. In the quantum circuit model, quantum bits (qubits) are operated on by quantum gates. A quantum circuit is a sequence of such quantum gates operating on some number of qubits. A quantum gate applied to a qubit can be controlled by other qubits in the circuit. This applies the gate only to the states which satisfy the required control qubit state. We particularly target FPGAs as our main simulation platform, as these offer potential energy savings when compared to running simulations on CPUs/GPUs.
  In this work, we present a memory access pattern to optimise the number of iterations that need to be scheduled to execute a quantum gate such that only the iterations which access the required pairs (determined according to the control qubits imposed on the gate) are scheduled. We show that this approach results in a significant reduction in the time required to simulate a gate for each added control qubit. We also show that this approach benefits the simulation time on FPGAs more than CPUs and GPUs and allows to outperform both CPU and GPU platforms in terms of energy efficiency, which is the main factor for scalability of the simulations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quantum Mpemba Effect in Markovian Systems and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) describes the counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system farther from equilibrium reaches steady state faster than one closer to equilibrium. However, ambiguity in defining a suitable distance measure between quantum states has led to varied interpretations across different contexts. Here we propose the intrinsic quantum Mpemba effect (IQME), defined using the trajectory length traced by the quantum state as a more appropriate measure of distance--distinct from previous trajectory-independent metrics. By treating quantum states as points in a Riemannian space defined by statistical distance, the trajectory length emerges as a more natural and accurate characterization of the counterintuitive dynamics, drawing an analogy to the classical Brachistochrone problem. We demonstrate the existence of IQME in Markovian systems and extend its definition to quantum circuits, thereby establishing a unified framework applicable to both open and closed systems. Notably, we observe an IQME in a $U(1)$-symmetric circuit, offering new insights into the rates of quantum thermalization for different initial states. This work deepens our understanding of quantum state evolution and lays the foundation for accurately capturing novel quantum dynamical behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography has become a powerful tool in learning about quantum states prepared on a quantum computer. Recent works have used classical shadows to variationally enforce N-representability conditions on the 2-particle reduced density matrix. In this paper, we build upon previous research by choice of an improved estimator within classical shadow tomography and rephrasing the optimisation constraints, resulting in an overall enhancement in performance under comparable measurement shot budgets. We further explore the specific regimes where these methods outperform the unbiased estimator of the standalone classical shadow protocol and quantify the potential savings in numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Statistical features of quantum chaos using the Krylov operator complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the Krylov operator complexity is proposed to evaluate the operator growth in quantum systems, and the variance of its Lanzcos coefficients is used as an important parameter for chaos. In this paper, we generate samples of random initial operators from given probability distribtions (GOE, GUE and the uniform distribution). For the Sinai billiard model, we study the statistical properties of the variance of Lanzcos coefficients in the associated Krylov space. Depending on whether the system is chaotic or not, the resulting distribution of the variance have different behaviors. In the nonchaotic case, the resulting distributions are almost overlapping together. In the chaotic case, they split into two well-separated groups. Besides, all the resulting distributions of the variance are the normal distribution, as long as the matrix size of the initial operator is large enough. This overlap-to-separation behavior, in the resulting distribution of the variance of Lanczos coefficients, may be a characteristics to distinguish chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum error correction with two-body gates for quantum registers based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers in diamond provide a possible hardware for quantum computation, where the most basic quantum information processing unit are nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, each in contact with adjacent carbon nuclear spins. With specifically tailored dynamical decoupling sequences, it is possible to execute selective, high-fidelity two-body gates between the electron spin of the NV center and a targeted nuclear spin. In this work, we present a method to determine the optimal execution time that balances the trade-off between fidelity and execution speed for gates generated by adaptive XY sequences. With these optimized gates, we use the nuclear spin environment as a code space for quantum error correction within a color center register.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores displaced fermionic Gaussian operators with nonzero linear terms. We first demonstrate equivalence between several characterizations of displaced Gaussian states. We also provide an efficient classical simulation protocol for displaced Gaussian circuits and demonstrate their computational equivalence to circuits composed of nearest-neighbor matchgates augmented by single-qubit gates on the initial line. Finally, we construct a novel Gaussianity-preserving unitary embedding that maps $n$-qubit displaced Gaussian states to $(n+1)$-qubit even Gaussian states. This embedding facilitates the generalization of existing Gaussian testing protocols to displaced Gaussian states and unitaries. Our results provide new tools to analyze fermionic systems beyond the constraints of parity super-selection, extending the theoretical understanding and practical simulation of fermionic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Ground-State Preparation of the Fermi-Hubbard Model on a Quantum Computer with 2D Topology via Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense promise for simulating quantum systems, a critical task for advancing our understanding of complex quantum phenomena. One of the primary goals in this domain is to accurately approximate the ground state of quantum systems. The Fermi-Hubbard model, particularly, is of profound interest due to its implications for high-temperature superconductivity and strongly correlated electron systems. The quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitary matrices (QETU) algorithm offers a novel approach for ground state estimation by utilizing a controlled Hamiltonian time evolution operator, circumventing the resource-intensive block-encoding required by previous methods. In this work, we apply the QETU algorithm to the $2 \times 2$ Fermi-Hubbard model, presenting circuit simplifications tailored to the model and introducing a mapping to a 9-qubit grid-like hardware architecture inspired by fermionic swap networks. We investigate how the selection of a favorable hardware architecture can benefit the circuit construction. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of this method under the influence of noise, focusing on its robustness and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Quantum optical scattering by macroscopic lossy objects: A general approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general approach to describe the scattering of quantum light by a lossy macroscopic object placed in vacuum with no restrictions on both its dispersive optical response and its spatially inhomogeneous composition. Our analysis is based on the modified Langevin noise formalism, a recently introduced version of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics where scattering (s) modes are explicitly separated from electric (e) and magnetic (m) medium excitations; accordingly the formalism involves three kinds of non-interacting boson polaritons such that, in the lossless limit, s-polaritons reduce to standard photons whereas e- and m-polaritons disappear. We analytically derive the input-output unitary relation joining the boson operators of the ingoing and outgoing polaritons, a nontrivial result hinging upon original relations which comprehensively describe the transmission-emission-absorption interplay pertaining the classical radiation scattering, relations we here deduce by resorting to the dyadic Green's function properties. Besides we exploit the input-output relation to connect the output state of the field to the input one, this unveiling the role played by various classical electromagnetic dyadics in quantum optical scattering. We specialize the discussion to the most common situation where the object is initially not electromagnetically excited, with the ingoing electromagnetic state only containing s-polaritons, and we analyze the impact of the classical transmission and absorption dyadics on the transitions from ingoing to outgoing s-polariton and on the creation of outgoing e- and m-polaritons, respectively. Since the scattered radiation is collected in the far-field and the object is usually left unmeasured, we analytically derive the reduced density operator of the outgoing s-polaritons.</description>

      <title>Bit symmetry entails the symmetry of the quantum transition probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is quite common to use the generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) as generic models to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles and to gain a better understanding of the probabilistic or information theoretic foundations of quantum physics and quantum computing. A variety of symmetry postulates was introduced and studied in this framework, including the transitivity of the automorphism group (1) on the pure states, (2) on the pairs of orthogonal pure states [these pairs are called 2-frames] and (3) on any frames of the same size. The second postulate is M\"uller and Ududec's bit symmetry, which they motivate by quantum computational needs. Here we explore these three postulates in the transition probability framework, which is more specific than the GPTs since the existence of the transition probabilities for the quantum logical atoms is presupposed either directly or indirectly via a certain geometric property of the state space. This property for compact convex sets was introduced by the author in a recent paper. We show that bit symmetry implicates the symmetry of the transition probabilities between the atoms. Using a result by Barnum and Hilgert, we can then conclude that the third rather strong symmetry postulate rules out all models but the classical cases and in the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras.</description>

      <title>From the Shastry-Sutherland model to the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalized Shastry-Sutherland model which bridges the Shastry-Sutherland model and the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. By employing large scale Density Matrix Renormalization Group and Fully Augmented Matrix Product State calculations, combined with careful finite-size scaling, we find the phase transition between the plaquette valence bond state (PVBS) and Neel anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phase in the pure Shastry-Sutherland model is a weak first one. This result indicates the existence of an exotic tri-critical point in the PVBS to AFM transition line in the phase diagram, as the transition in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model was previously determined to be continuous. We determine the location of the tri-critical point in the phase diagram at which first-order transition turns to continuous. Our generalized Shastry-Sutherland model provides not only a valuable platform to explore exotic phases and phase transitions but also more realistic description of Shastry-Sutherland materials like SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Constraining symmetron fields with a levitated optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetron, one of the light scalar fields introduced by dark energy theories, is thought to modify the gravitational force when it couples to matter. However, detecting the symmetron field is challenging due to its screening behavior in the high-density environment of traditional measurements. In this paper, we propose a scheme to set constraints on the parameters of the symmetron with a levitated optomechanical system, in which a nanosphere serves as a testing mass coupled to an optical cavity. By measuring the frequency shift of the probe transmission spectrum, we can establish constraints for our scheme by calculating the symmetron-induced influence. These refined constraints improve by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to current force-based detection methods, which offer new opportunities for the dark energy detection.</description>

      <title>Scalable iterative pruning of large language and vision models using block coordinate descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pruning neural networks, which involves removing a fraction of their weights, can often maintain high accuracy while significantly reducing model complexity, at least up to a certain limit. We present a neural network pruning technique that builds upon the Combinatorial Brain Surgeon, but solves an optimization problem over a subset of the network weights in an iterative, block-wise manner using block coordinate descent. The iterative, block-based nature of this pruning technique, which we dub ``iterative Combinatorial Brain Surgeon'' (iCBS) allows for scalability to very large models, including large language models (LLMs), that may not be feasible with a one-shot combinatorial optimization approach. When applied to large models like Mistral and DeiT, iCBS achieves higher performance metrics at the same density levels compared to existing pruning methods such as Wanda. This demonstrates the effectiveness of this iterative, block-wise pruning method in compressing and optimizing the performance of large deep learning models, even while optimizing over only a small fraction of the weights. Moreover, our approach allows for a quality-time (or cost) tradeoff that is not available when using a one-shot pruning technique alone. The block-wise formulation of the optimization problem enables the use of hardware accelerators, potentially offsetting the increased computational costs compared to one-shot pruning methods like Wanda. In particular, the optimization problem solved for each block is quantum-amenable in that it could, in principle, be solved by a quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter have been widely studied for their robustness against impurities and disorder. The broad applicability of topological materials relies on the reliable transition from idealized, mathematically perfect models to finite, real-world implementations. In this paper, we explore the effects of finite size and disorders on topological properties. We propose a new criterion for characterizing finite topological systems based on the bulk conductivity of topological edge modes. We analyze the behavior of bulk conductivity and real space topological invariants both analytically and numerically for the family of SSH models. We show that our approach offers practical insights for topology determination in contemporary intermediate scale experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Spin flip locking by the tunneling and relaxation in a driven double quantum dot with spin-orbit coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled spin evolution and tunneling together with the relaxation and decoherence effects are studied for the double quantum dot formed in a semiconductor nanowire and driven by the periodic electric field. Such system represents a model of the spin and charge qubits interacting via the strong spin-orbit coupling. It is found that at certain regimes the combination of fast relaxation in the coordinate channel with the slower relaxation in the spin channel leads to the promising combination of fast spin manipulation and slow spin relaxation, locking the flipped spin in an excited state in one of the dots for a sufficiently long time. The predicted effect is maintained for a wide range of the relaxation times and the driving amplitude both for the coordinate and the spin channels and is also observed on higher subharmonic which requires lower driving frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) point of the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain is a cornerstone example of a disorder point where short-range correlations become incommensurate, and correlation lengths and momenta are non-analytic. While the presence of singularities appears to be generic for AKLT points, we show that for a family of SU(N) models, the AKLT point is not a disorder point: It occurs entirely within an incommensurate phase yet the wave vector remains singular on both sides of the AKLT point. We conjecture that this new possibility is generic for models where the representation is not self-conjugate and the transfer matrix non-Hermitian, while for self-conjugate representations the AKLT points remain disorder points.</description>

      <title>Integrating Machine Learning and Quantum Circuits for Proton Affinity Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key step in interpreting gas-phase ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry (IM-MS) data for unknown structure prediction involves identifying the most favorable protonated structure. In the gas phase, the site of protonation is determined using proton affinity (PA) measurements. Currently, mass spectrometry and ab initio computation methods are widely used to evaluate PA; however, both methods are resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a critical need for efficient methods to estimate PA, enabling the rapid identification of the most favorable protonation site in complex organic molecules with multiple proton binding sites. In this work, we developed a fast and accurate method for PA prediction by using multiple descriptors in combination with machine learning (ML) models. Using a comprehensive set of 186 descriptors, our model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an R2 of 0.96 and a MAE of 2.47kcal/mol, comparable to experimental uncertainty. Furthermore, we designed quantum circuits as feature encoders for a classical neural network. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid quantum-classical model, we compared its performance with traditional ML models using a reduced feature set derived from the full set. The result showed that this hybrid model achieved consistent performance comparable to traditional ML models with the same reduced feature set on both a noiseless simulator and real quantum hardware, highlighting the potential of quantum machine learning for accurate and efficient PA predictions.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Forces in Photon-Medium Interactions Using Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines dissipative forces in photon-medium interactions through time-independent perturbation theory, with a specific focus on single Helium-4 atoms. Utilizing a Hamiltonian framework, energy corrections induced by dissipative gravitational frictional effects in low-density systems are derived and analyzed as a function of inter-atomic distance. The calculations reveal an energy correction peak at $r_1 = 0.1 nm$, followed by rapid exponential decay, highlighting the dominance of nonlinear dissipative effects at nanoscale separations. These findings emphasize the critical role of short-range interactions, governed by the de-Broglie wavelength of Helium-4, and provide a rigorous theoretical basis for understanding photon-medium interactions at quantum scales. This novel single-particle approach departs from macroscopic mean-field models, offering unique insights into the microscopic mechanisms underlying energy dissipation. The results have potential implications for advancing quantum information processing, nonlinear optics, and the study of dissipative mechanisms in quantum fluids. Experimental validation of the theoretical predictions is proposed using state-of-the-art techniques in optical media, levitated nanoparticle systems, and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation dominated period (RD), and the matter dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the $R^2$ inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, taking into account the violations of slow roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar across both methods, regardless of the potential under consideration. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the RD and MD phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly and internode scatterings in multifold semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our quest to unravel the topological properties of nodal points in three-dimensional semimetals, one hallmark property which warrants our attention is the chiral anomaly. In the Brillouin zone (BZ), the sign of the Berry-curvature field's monopole charge is referred to as the chirality ($\chi$) of the node, leading to the notion of chiral quasiparticles sourcing chiral currents, induced by internode scatterings proportional to the chiral anomaly. Here, we derive the generic form of the chiral conductivity when we have multifold nodes. Since the sum of all the monopole charges in the BZ are constrained to vanish, the nodes appear in pairs of $\chi =\pm 1$. Hence, the presence of band-crossing degeneracies of order higher than two make it possible to have two distinct scenarios -- the pair of conjugate nodes in question comprise bands of the same pseudospin variety or of two distinct pseudospin-representations. Covering these two possibilities, we apply our derived formula to semimetals harbouring triple-point (threefold-degenerate) and Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (fourfold-degenerate) nodes, and show the resulting expressions for the conductivity featuring the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum field theories are a promising tool to study open quantum systems. These theories preserve unitarity if PT-symmetry is respected, and in that case an equivalent Hermitian description exists via the so-called Dyson map. Generically, PT-symmetric non-Hermitian theories can also feature phases where PT-symmetry is broken and unitarity is lost. We review the construction of holographic duals to strongly coupled PT-symmetric quantum field theories and the study of their phase diagram. We next focus on spacetime-dependent non-Hermitian couplings: non-Hermitian quenches and lattices. They violate the null energy condition in the gravity dual. The lattices realize phases supporting an imaginary current that breaks PT-symmetry spontaneously. Remarkably, these non-Hermitian lattices flow to a PT-symmetric fixed point in the IR.</description>

By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhance the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and imposes a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade and quantum information processing in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.</description>

      <title>The Solvay Councils, de Broglie's brothers, and the development of wave-particle duality</title>

Abstract: The meeting patronized by Ernest Solvay in 1911, the first Solvay Council, marked the beginning of what can be called the first quantum revolution. Maurice de Broglie was one of the secretaries of the Council. He participated in the two following conferences and contributed to the third Council with his work. Louis de Broglie collaborated and discussed with his elder brother. Departing from Maurice's achievements, Louis developed his approach to the wave-particle duality of light and extended it to other particles. He presented it at the fifth meeting in 1927. This paper investigates the connection between the two scientists and the Solvay Councils, arguing that this link was essential in developing the first quantum revolution, a process that ended, according to Werner Heisenberg, at the fifth Solvay Physics Council.</description>

      <title>Frequency redistribution and step-size distribution of light scattered by atomic vapor: applications to L\'evy flight random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of light that undergoes multiple-scattering by resonant atomic vapor can be described as a L\'evy flight. L\'evy flight is a random walk with heavy tailed step-size (r) distribution, decaying asymptotically as $P(r)\sim r^{-1-\alpha}$, with $\alpha&lt;2$. The large steps, typical of L\'evy flights, have its origins in frequency redistribution of the light scattered by the vapor. We calculate the frequency redistribution function and the step-size distribution for light diffusion in atomic vapor. From the step-size distribution we extract a L\'evy parameter $\alpha$ that depends on the step's size. We investigate how the frequency redistribution function and step-size distribution are influenced by the finite size of the vapor and the many-level structure typical for alkali vapors. Finite size of the vapor introduces cutoff on the light scattered spectrum and thus in the size of steps. Multi-level structure introduces oscillations in $P(r)$ slope. Both effects might have an impact on measurables related to the L\'evy flight random walk.</description>

      <title>Parallel Token Swapping for Qubit Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a combinatorial reconfiguration problem that involves finding an optimal sequence of swaps to move an initial configuration of tokens that are placed on the vertices of a graph to a final desired one. This problem arises as a crucial step in reducing the depth of a quantum circuit when compiling a quantum algorithm. We provide the first known constant factor approximation algorithms for the parallel token swapping problem on graph topologies that are commonly found in modern quantum computers, including cycle graphs, subdivided star graphs, and grid graphs. We also study the so-called stretch factor of a natural lower bound to the problem, which has been shown to be useful when designing heuristics for the qubit routing problem. Finally, we study the colored version of this reconfiguration problem where some tokens share the same color and are considered indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Approaching ideal visibility in singlet-triplet qubit operations using energy-selective tunneling-based Hamiltonian estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report energy selective tunneling readout-based Hamiltonian parameter estimation of a two-electron spin qubit in a GaAs quantum dot array. Optimization of readout fidelity enables a single-shot measurement time of 16 on average, with adaptive initialization and efficient qubit frequency estimation based on real-time Bayesian inference. For qubit operation in a frequency heralded mode, we observe a 40-fold increase in coherence time without resorting to dynamic nuclear polarization. We also demonstrate active frequency feedback with quantum oscillation visibility, single-shot measurement fidelity, and state initialization fidelity up to 97.7%, 99%, and over 99.7%, respectively. By pushing the sensitivity of the energy selective tunneling-based spin to charge conversion to the limit, the technique is useful for advanced quantum control protocols such as error mitigation schemes, where fast qubit parameter calibration with a large signal-to-noise ratio is crucial.</description>

      <title>Stochastic entropy production associated with quantum measurement in a framework of Markovian quantum state diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reduced density matrix that characterises the state of an open quantum system is a projection from the full density matrix of the quantum system and its environment, and there are many full density matrices consistent with a given reduced version. Without a specification of relevant details of the environment, the evolution of a reduced density matrix is therefore typically unpredictable, even if the dynamics are deterministic. With this in mind, we investigate a two level open quantum system using a framework of quantum state diffusion. We consider the pseudorandom evolution of its reduced density matrix when subjected to an environment-driven process of continuous quantum measurement of a system observable, using dynamics that asymptotically send the system to an eigenstate. The unpredictability is characterised by a stochastic entropy production, the average of which corresponds to an increase in the subjective uncertainty of the quantum state adopted by the system and environment, given the underspecified dynamics. This differs from a change in von Neumann entropy, and can continue indefinitely as the system is guided towards an eigenstate. As one would expect, the simultaneous measurement of two non-commuting observables within the same framework does not send the system to an eigenstate. Instead, the probability density function describing the reduced density matrix of the system becomes stationary over a continuum of pure states, a situation characterised by zero further stochastic entropy production. Transitions between such stationary states, brought about by changes in the relative strengths of the two measurement processes, give rise to finite positive mean stochastic entropy production. The framework investigated can offer useful perspectives on both the dynamics and irreversible thermodynamics of measurement in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient decoding of stabilizer code by single-qubit local operations and classical communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a protocol for extracting distributed one-qubit quantum information encoded in a stabilizer code of multiple qubits, only by single-qubit local operations and classical communication (LOCC) without global operations or entanglement resources. This protocol achieves efficient extraction within a polynomial time in terms of the number of physical qubits. We apply this protocol to a setting of quantum information splitting where a subset of spatially separated parties cooperate by classical communication to extract quantum information shared among all the parties. For this task, our LOCC extraction protocol allows designing hierarchical information access structures among the parties, where the minimum number of parties required to cooperate depends on the location of extracting the shared quantum information. These results provide a fundamental building block of distributed quantum information processing that requires access to distributed quantum information encoded in the stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>Problem-tailored Simulation of Energy Transport on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility to apply quantum machine learning techniques for data analysis, with particular regard to an interesting use-case in high-energy physics. We propose an anomaly detection algorithm based on a parametrized quantum circuit. This algorithm has been trained on a classical computer and tested with simulations as well as on real quantum hardware. Tests on NISQ devices have been performed with IBM quantum computers. For the execution on quantum hardware specific hardware driven adaptations have been devised and implemented. The quantum anomaly detection algorithm is able to detect simple anomalies like different characters in handwritten digits as well as more complex structures like anomalous patterns in the particle detectors produced by the decay products of long-lived particles produced at a collider experiment. For the high-energy physics application, performance is estimated in simulation only, as the quantum circuit is not simple enough to be executed on the available quantum hardware. This work demonstrates that it is possible to perform anomaly detection with quantum algorithms, however, as amplitude encoding of classical data is required for the task, due to the noise level in the available quantum hardware, current implementation cannot outperform classic anomaly detection algorithms based on deep neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Efficient error estimates for the Trotter product formula are central in quantum computing, mathematical physics, and numerical simulations. However, the Trotter error's dependency on the input state and its application to unbounded operators remains unclear. Here, we present a general theory for error estimation, including higher-order product formulas, with explicit input state dependency. Our approach overcomes two limitations of the existing operator-norm estimates in the literature. First, previous bounds are too pessimistic as they quantify the worst-case scenario. Second, previous bounds become trivial for unbounded operators and cannot be applied to a wide class of Trotter scenarios, including atomic and molecular Hamiltonians. Our method enables analytical treatment of Trotter errors in chemistry simulations, illustrated through a case study on the hydrogen atom. Our findings reveal: (i) for states with fat-tailed energy distribution, such as low-angular-momentum states of the hydrogen atom, the Trotter error scales worse than expected (sublinearly) in the number of Trotter steps; (ii) certain states do not admit an advantage in the scaling from higher-order Trotterization, and thus, the higher-order Trotter hierarchy breaks down for these states, including the hydrogen atom's ground state; (iii) the scaling of higher-order Trotter bounds might depend on the order of the Hamiltonians in the Trotter product for states with fat-tailed energy distribution. Physically, the enlarged Trotter error is caused by the atom's ionization due to the Trotter dynamics. Mathematically, we find that certain domain conditions are not satisfied by some states so higher moments of the potential and kinetic energies diverge. Our analytical error analysis agrees with numerical simulations, indicating that we can estimate the state-dependent Trotter error scaling genuinely.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between the algebraic structure (operator algebras) for the quantum observables and the convex structure of the state space has been explored for a long time and most advanced results are due to Alfsen and Shultz. Here we present a more elementary approach with a more generic structure for the observables, which focuses on the transition probability of the quantum logical atoms. The binary case gives rise to the generalized qubit models and was fully developed in a preceding paper. Here we consider any case with finite information capacity (binary means that the information capacity is 2). A novel geometric property that makes any compact convex set a matching state space is presented. Generally, the transition probability is not symmetric; if it is symmetric, we get an inner product and a self-dual cone. The emerging mathematical structure comes close to the Euclidean Jordan algebras and becomes a new mathematical model for a potential extension of quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring continuous time crystals (CTCs) within the symmetric subspace of spin systems has been a subject of intensive research in recent times. Thus far, the stability of the time-crystal phase outside the symmetric subspace in such spin systems has gone largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the effect of including the asymmetric subspaces on the dynamics of CTCs in a driven dissipative spin model. This results in multistability, and the dynamics becomes dependent on the initial state. Remarkably, this multistability leads to exotic synchronization regimes such as chimera states and cluster synchronization in an ensemble of coupled identical CTCs. Interestingly, it leads to other nonlinear phenomena such as oscillation death and signature of chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic security is considered with unreliable entanglement assistance, due to one of two reasons: Interception or loss. We consider two corresponding models. In the first model, Eve may intercept the entanglement resource. In the second model, Eve is passive, and the resource may dissipate to the environment beyond her reach. We derive achievable rates for both models, subject to a maximal error criterion and semantic security. As an example, we consider the amplitude damping channel. Under interception, time division is not necessarily possible, and the boundary of our achievable region is disconnected. In the passive model, our rate region outperforms time division.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a universal logical gate set in error-detecting surface codes on a superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is essential for achieving large-scale practical quantum computation. Implementing arbitrary FTQC requires the execution of a universal gate set on logical qubits, which is highly challenging. Particularly, in the superconducting system, two-qubit gates on surface code logical qubits have not been realized. Here, we experimentally implement a logical CNOT gate along with arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates on distance-2 surface codes using the superconducting quantum processor \textit{Wukong}, thereby demonstrating a universal logical gate set. In the experiment, we demonstrate the transversal CNOT gate on a two-dimensional topological processor based on a tailored encoding circuit, at the cost of removing the ancilla qubits required for stabilizer measurements. Furthermore, we fault-tolerantly prepare logical Bell states and observe a violation of CHSH inequality, confirming the entanglement between logical qubits. Using the logical CNOT gate and an ancilla logical state, arbitrary single-qubit rotation gates are realized through gate teleportation. All logical gates are characterized on a complete state set and their fidelities are evaluated by logical Pauli transfer matrices. The demonstration of a universal logical gate set and the entangled logical states highlights significant aspects of FTQC on superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum machines using $\rm{Cu}_{3}$-like compounds modeled by Heisenberg antiferromagnetic in a triangular ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical study of an antiferromagnetically coupled spin system, specifically $\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{X}$ $(\rm{X=As, Sb})$, characterized by a slightly distorted equilateral triangle configuration is presented. Using the Heisenberg model with exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, g-factors, and an external magnetic field, three quantum machines are investigated using this system as the working substance, assuming reversible processes. For ${\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{X}}$ he magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is significant at low temperatures (around 1K) under a perpendicular magnetic field ($\sim5$T). Although only the $\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{As}$ compound is considered, since the $\rm{Cu}_{3}-\rm{Sb}$ compound behaves quite similarly. How MCE influences the Carnot machine, which operates as a heat engine or refrigerator when varying the external magnetic field is analyzed. In contrast, the Otto and Stirling machines can operate as heat engines, refrigerators, heaters, or thermal accelerators, depending on the magnetic field intensity. The results indicate that enhanced MCE broadens the operating regions for these machines, with the Otto and Stirling machines primarily functioning as refrigerators and accelerators. The corresponding thermal efficiencies are also discussed for all operating modes.</description>

      <title>Managing Classical Processing Requirements for Quantum Error Correction</title>

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction requires decoders to process syndromes generated by the error-correction circuits. These decoders must process syndromes faster than they are being generated to prevent a backlog of undecoded syndromes. This backlog can exponentially increase the time required to execute the program, which has resulted in the development of fast hardware decoders that accelerate decoding. Applications utilizing error-corrected quantum computers will require hundreds to thousands of logical qubits and provisioning a hardware decoder for every logical qubit can be very costly. In this work, we present a framework to reduce the number of hardware decoders and navigate the compute-performace trade-offs without sacrificing the performance or reliability of program execution. Through workload-centric characterizations performed by our framework, we propose efficient decoder scheduling policies that can reduce the number of hardware decoders required to run a program by up to 10X. With the proposed framework, scalability can be achieved via decoder virtualization, and individual decoders can be built to maximize accuracy and performance.</description>

      <title>Barycentric bounds on the error exponents of quantum hypothesis exclusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a nonadaptive strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</description>

Abstract: In the current era of quantum computing, robust and efficient tools are essential to bridge the gap between simulations and quantum hardware execution. In this work, we introduce a machine learning approach to characterize the noise impacting a quantum chip and emulate it during simulations. Our algorithm leverages reinforcement learning, offering increased flexibility in reproducing various noise models compared to conventional techniques such as randomized benchmarking or heuristic noise models. The effectiveness of the RL agent has been validated through simulations and testing on real superconducting qubits. Additionally, we provide practical use-case examples for the study of renowned quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum-Mechanical Evolutions from Probability Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of both time-optimal and time sub-optimal quantum Hamiltonian evolutions connecting arbitrary source and a target states on the Bloch sphere equipped with the Fubini-Study metric. This investigation is performed in a number of steps. First, we describe each unitary Schr\"odinger quantum evolution by means of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient of its corresponding dynamical trajectory linking the source state to the target state. Second, starting from a classical probabilistic setting where the so-called information geometric complexity can be employed to describe the complexity of entropic motion on curved statistical manifolds underlying the physics of systems when only partial knowledge about them is available, we transition into a deterministic quantum setting. In this context, after proposing a definition of the complexity of a quantum evolution, we present a notion of quantum complexity length scale. In particular, we discuss the physical significance of both quantities in terms of the accessed (i.e., partial) and accessible (i.e., total) parametric volumes of the regions on the Bloch sphere that specify the quantum mechanical evolution from the source to the target states. Third, after calculating the complexity measure and the complexity length scale for each one of the two quantum evolutions, we compare the behavior of our measures with that of the path length, the geodesic efficiency, the speed efficiency, and the curvature coefficient. We find that, in general, efficient quantum evolutions are less complex than inefficient evolutions. However, we also observe that complexity is more than length. Indeed, longer paths that are sufficiently bent can exhibit a behavior that is less complex than that of shorter paths with a smaller curvature coefficient.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Density Matrices via Dense Dual Bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient understanding of a quantum system fundamentally relies on the selection of observables. Pauli observables and mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are widely used in practice and are often regarded as theoretically optimal for quantum state tomography (QST). However, Pauli observables require a large number of measurements for full-state tomography and do not permit direct measurement of density matrix elements with a constant number of observables. For MUBs, the existence of complete sets of \(d+1\) bases in all dimensions remains unresolved, highlighting the need for alternative observables. In this work, we introduce Dense Dual Bases (DDB), a novel set of \(2d\) observables specifically designed to enable the complete characterization of any \(d\)-dimensional quantum state. These observables offer two key advantages. First, they enable direct measurement of density matrix elements without auxiliary systems, allowing any element to be extracted using only three selected observables. Second, QST for unknown rank-\(r\) density matrices--excluding only a negligible subset--can be achieved with \(O(r \log d)\) observables, significantly improving measurement efficiency. As for circuit implementation, each observable is iteratively generated and can be efficiently decomposed into \(O(n^4)\) elementary gates for an \(n\)-qubit system. These advances establish DDB as a practical and scalable alternative to traditional methods, offering promising opportunities to advance the efficiency and scalability of quantum system characterization.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory perturbative methods for local quantum spin chain quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss local magnetic field quenches using perturbative methods of finite time path field theory (FTPFT) in the following spin chains: Ising and XY in a transverse magnetic field. Their common characteristics are: (i) they are integrable via mapping to a second quantized noninteracting fermion problem; and (ii) when the ground state is nondegenerate (true for finite chains except in special cases), it can be represented as a vacuum of Bogoliubov fermions. By switching on a local magnetic field perturbation at finite time, the problem becomes nonintegrable and must be approached via numeric or perturbative methods. Using the formalism of FTPFT based on Wigner transforms (WTs) of projected functions, we show how to: (i) calculate the basic ``bubble'' diagram in the Loschmidt echo (LE) of a quenched chain to any order in the perturbation; and (ii) resum the generalized Schwinger--Dyson equation for the fermion two-point retarded functions in the ``bubble'' diagram, hence achieving the resummation of perturbative expansion of LE for a wide range of perturbation strengths under certain analyticity assumptions. Limitations of the assumptions and possible generalizations beyond it and also for other spin chains are further discussed.</description>

      <title>Interplay between external driving, dissipation and collective effects in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the combined influence of external driving and dissipation is crucial for studying nonequilibrium quantum phenomena and advancing technological applications. The present study addresses this issue by investigating open-system behavior in driven optical systems coupled to a bosonic field. Starting from an exact non-Markovian master equation for linear systems, we extend the analysis to an ensemble of quantum emitters and validate the proposed solution. The analytical results unveil a range of intriguing phenomena, including pronounced non-Markovian corrections to the coherent driving and a collective cross-driving effect. These effects are experimentally accessible in platforms such as cavity QED, photonic crystals, and state-dependent optical lattices. In the Markovian limit, comparisons with exact solutions reveal short-time non-Markovian effects that endure well beyond the environmental correlation decay time, alongside memory effects triggered by short laser pulses. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of driven open systems, laying the groundwork for precise quantum state control.</description>

Abstract: The ability to coherently control and read out qubits with long coherence times in a scalable system is a crucial requirement for any quantum processor. Nuclear spins in the solid state have shown great promise as long-lived qubits. Control and readout of individual nuclear spin qubit registers has made major progress in the recent years using individual electron spin ancilla addressed either electrically or optically. Here, we present a new platform for quantum information processing, consisting of $^{183}$W nuclear spin qubits adjacent to an Er$^{3+}$ impurity in a CaWO$_4$ crystal, interfaced via a superconducting resonator and detected using a microwave photon counter at 10mK. We study two nuclear spin qubits with $T_2^*$ of $0.8(2)~$s and $1.2(3)~$s, $T_2$ of $3.4(4)~$s and $4.4(6)~$ s, respectively. We demonstrate single-shot quantum non-demolition readout of each nuclear spin qubit using the Er$^{3+}$ spin as an ancilla. We introduce a new scheme for all-microwave single- and two-qubit gates, based on stimulated Raman driving of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system. We realize single- and two-qubit gates on a timescale of a few milliseconds, and prepare a decoherence-protected Bell state with 88% fidelity and $T_2^*$ of $1.7(2)~$s. Our results are a proof-of-principle demonstrating the potential of solid-state nuclear spin qubits as a promising platform for quantum information processing. With the potential to scale to tens or hundreds of qubits, this platform has prospects for the development of scalable quantum processors with long-lived qubits.</description>

      <title>Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: Optimality with Limitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on $n$-bits in time $\text{poly}(n) 2^{n/2}$. In this work, we investigate whether such general statements can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is \#P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization problem using this approach.</description>

Abstract: The Purcell effect, a common issue in qubit-resonator systems leading to fidelity loss is studied while its suppression is achieved using a novel qubit readout circuit design. Our approach utilizes a unique coupling architecture in which, the qubit first interacts with a filter resonator before linking to the readout resonator. This configuration enables precise control over the Purcell decay rate and ac Stark factor without impacting on measuring time. The mentioned factor is highly sensitive to the coupling strength between the readout resonator and the filter, meaning that the factor adjustment directly impacts the qubit state detection. A major advantage of this design is that tuning the resonator-filter coupling strength is relatively straightforward, offering flexibility in fine-tuning ac Stark factor.</description>

Abstract: We consider the scenario of a fluctuating spacetime due to a deformed commutation relation with a fluctuating deformation parameter, or to a fluctuating metric tensor. By computing the resulting dynamics and averaging over these fluctuations, we find that a system experiences a decoherence in the momentum basis. We studied the predictions of the model for a free particle and an harmonic oscillator. Using experimental data taken from a mechanical oscillator prepared in quantum states of motion, we put a bound on the free parameters of the considered model. In addition, we comment on how these measurements can also provide bounds to other phenomenological quantum gravity models, such as the length scale for nonlocal dynamics.</description>

      <title>An unconditional distribution learning advantage with shallow quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the core challenges of research in quantum computing is concerned with the question whether quantum advantages can be found for near-term quantum circuits that have implications for practical applications. Motivated by this mindset, in this work, we prove an unconditional quantum advantage in the probably approximately correct (PAC) distribution learning framework with shallow quantum circuit hypotheses. We identify a meaningful generative distribution learning problem where constant-depth quantum circuits using one and two qubit gates (QNC^0) are superior compared to constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits (NC^0) as a choice for hypothesis classes. We hence prove a PAC distribution learning separation for shallow quantum circuits over shallow classical circuits. We do so by building on recent results by Bene Watts and Parham on unconditional quantum advantages for sampling tasks with shallow circuits, which we technically uplift to a hyperplane learning problem, identifying non-local correlations as the origin of the quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Enhancing Entanglement for Two-Photon-Driven Rabi Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A control scheme is proposed that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance entanglement by modulating the two-photon-driven amplitude in a Rabi model. The quantum phase diagram versus the amplitude of the two-photon process and the coupling between the cavity field and the atom in the Rabi model, is indicated by the energy spectrum of the hybrid system, the witness of entanglement, second order correlation, and negativity of Wigner function. From a dynamical perspective, the behavior of entanglement can reflect the phase transition and the reinforcement learning agent is employed to produce temporal sequences of control pulses to enhance the entanglement in the presence of dissipation. The entanglement can be enhanced in different parameter regimes and the control scheme exhibits robustness against dissipation. The replaceability of the controlled system and the reinforcement learning module demonstrates the generalization of this scheme. This research paves the way of positively enhancing quantum resources in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness of tripartite entangled states in passive PT-symmetric qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems have attracted significant interest in recent years due to the presence of unique spectral singularities known as exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. The drastic changes in these systems around their EPs have led to unique entanglement dynamics, which remained elusive until quite recently. In this work, we theoretically investigate the robustness of tripartite entanglement induced by EPs of the passive PT-symmetric non-Hermitian superconducting qubits, both in stand-alone configurations and hybrid setups with Hermitian qubits. In particular, we consider the qubits with both all-to-all and nearest-neighbour couplings under uniform and non-uniform coupling strengths. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian qubits with all-to-all coupling generate GHZ states, while those with nearest-neighbour interactions produce W states. These entangled states are resilient to non-uniform couplings and off-resonant driving fields. Moreover, the hybrid configurations combining Hermitian and non-Hermitian qubits suggest the importance of EPs for generating and maintaining genuine tripartite entanglement in our system. Additionally, driving the PT-symmetric qubits with a strong Rabi frequency can help sustain tripartite entanglement over time by countering losses, while strong inter-qubit coupling can benefit these entangled states in the low dissipation regime. These findings suggest that exploiting non-Hermitian systems and their associated EPs can create robust entangled states which are useful for both fundamental studies and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Spin shuttling in a silicon double quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.03598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of quantum information between different nodes of a quantum device is among the challenging functionalities of a quantum processor. In the context of spin qubits, this requirement can be met by coherent electron spin shuttling between semiconductor quantum dots. Here we theoretically study a minimal version of spin shuttling between two quantum dots. To this end, we analyze the dynamics of an electron during a detuning sweep in a silicon double quantum dot (DQD) occupied by one electron. Possibilities and limitations of spin transport are investigated. Spin-orbit interaction and the Zeeman effect in an inhomogeneous magnetic field play an important role for spin shuttling and are included in our model. Interactions that couple the position, spin and valley degrees of freedom open a number of avoided crossings in the spectrum allowing for diabatic transitions and interfering paths. The outcomes of single and repeated spin shuttling protocols are explored by means of numerical simulations and an approximate analytical model based on the solution of the Landau--Zener problem. We find that a spin infidelity as low as $1-F_s\lesssim 0.002$ with a relatively fast level velocity of $\alpha = 600\, {\mu}$eV/ns is feasible for optimal choices of parameters or by making use of constructive interference.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a cavity-induced measurement of the exchange coupling in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.00797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spin qubit arrays the exchange coupling can be harnessed to implement two-qubit gates and to realize intermediate-range qubit connectivity along a spin bus. In this work, we propose a scheme to characterize the exchange coupling between electrons in adjacent quantum dots. We investigate theoretically the transmission of a microwave resonator coupled to a triple quantum dot (TQD) occupied by two electrons. We assume that the right quantum dot (QD) is always occupied by one electron while the second electron can tunnel between the left and center QD. If the two electrons are in adjacent dots they interact via the exchange coupling. By means of analytical calculations we show that the transmission profile of the resonator directly reveals the value of the exchange coupling strength between two electrons. From perturbation theory up to second order we conclude that the exchange can still be identified in the presence of magnetic gradients. A valley splitting comparable to the inter-dot tunnel coupling will lead to further modifications of the cavity transmission dips that also depend on the valley phases.</description>

      <title>Theory of the Simultaneous Transient Dispersive Readout of Multiple Spin Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a paradigm of multiplexed dispersive qubit measurement performed while the qubits dephase. A Laplace transformation of the time-dependent cavity response allows to separate contributions from multiple qubits coupled to the same resonator mode, thus allowing for simultaneous single-shot read out. With realistic parameters for silicon spin qubits we find a competitive readout fidelity, while the measurement time compares favourably to conventional dispersive readout. We extend the multiplexed readout method to quantum non-demolition measurements using auxiliary qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information propagation in the one-dimensional infinite temperature Hubbard model with a dissipative particle sink at the end of a semi-infinite chain is studied. In the strongly interacting limit, the two-site mutual information and the operator entanglement entropy exhibit a rich structure with two propagating information fronts and superimposed interference fringes. A classical reversible cellular automaton model quantitatively captures the transport and the slow, classical part of the correlations, but fails to describe the rapidly propagating information jet. The fast quantum jet resembles coherent free particle propagation, with the accompanying long-ranged interference fringes that are exponentially damped by short-ranged spin correlations in the many-body background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture a relation between the local dimension $d$ of a local nearest-neighbor critical Hamiltonian in one spatial dimension and the maximum central charge, $c_{\text{max}}$, that it can yield. Specifically, we propose that $c_{\text{max}} \leq d-1$, establishing a link between the short-distance lattice realization of a model and its emerging long-distance entanglement properties. This inequality can be viewed as a general form of a $c$-theorem establishing the reduction of effective degrees of freedom between the UV lattice and the IR conformal field theory. We support this conjecture with numerous examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transfer from a twisted light beam to an electron in atomic ionization within the first Born approximation. The characteristics of the ejected electron are studied regardless of the detection scheme. We find that the outgoing electron possesses a definite projection of OAM when a single atom is located on the propagation axis of the photon, whereas the size of the electron wave packet is determined solely by the energy of the photon rather than by its transverse coherence length. Shifting the position of the atom yields a finite dispersion of the electron OAM. We also study a more experimentally feasible scenario - a localized finite-sized atomic target - and develop representative approaches to describing coherent and incoherent regimes of photoionization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on Google's sycamore NISQ platform on the spin transport resulting from a non-unitary periodic boundary drive of an XXZ chain, we study a classical variant thereof by a combination of analytical and numerical means. We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in remarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of the spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane), subdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this phenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit that the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively between the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of ballistic transport in a disordered setting.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent approach to the dynamics of excitation energy transfer in multichromophoric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally tractable and reliable, albeit approximate, methods for studying exciton transport in molecular aggregates immersed in structured bosonic environments have been actively developed. Going beyond the lowest-order (Born) approximation for the memory kernel of the quantum master equation typically results in complicated and possibly divergent expressions. Starting from the memory kernel in the Born approximation, and recognizing the quantum master equation as the Dyson equation of Green's functions theory, we formulate the self-consistent Born approximation to resum the memory-kernel perturbation series in powers of the exciton--environment interaction. Our formulation is in the Liouville space and frequency domain and handles arbitrary exciton--environment spectral densities. In a molecular dimer coupled to an overdamped oscillator environment, we conclude that the self-consistent cycle significantly improves the Born-approximation energy-transfer dynamics. The dynamics in the self-consistent Born approximation agree well with the solutions of hierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters, including the most challenging regimes of strong exciton--environment interactions, slow environments, and low temperatures. This is rationalized by the analytical considerations of coherence-dephasing dynamics in the pure-dephasing model. We find that the self-consistent Born approximation is good (poor) at describing energy transfer modulated by an underdamped vibration resonant (off-resonant) with the exciton energy gap. Nevertheless, it reasonably describes exciton dynamics in the seven-site model of the Fenna--Matthews--Olson complex in a realistic environment comprising both an overdamped continuum and underdamped vibrations.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Quantum Dynamics of Molecules Scattering from Metal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic coupling between electrons and molecular motion at metal surfaces leads to energy dissipation and dynamical steering effects during chemical surface dynamics. We present a theoretical approach to the scattering of molecules from metal surfaces that incorporates all nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects due to the coupling of the molecular degrees of freedom to the electrons in the metal. This is achieved with the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach combined with a matrix product state representation in twin space. The method is applied to the scattering of nitric oxide from Au(111), for which strongly nonadiabatic energy loss during scattering has been experimentally observed, thus presenting a significant theoretical challenge. Since the HEOM approach treats the molecule-surface coupling exactly, it captures the interplay between nonadiabatic and quantum nuclear effects. Finally, the data obtained by the HEOM approach is used as a rigorous benchmark to assess various mixed quantum-classical methods, from which we derive insights into the mechanisms of energy dissipation and the suitable working regimes of each method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use large-$N$ diagrammatic techniques to calculate the relative entropy of symmetric random states drawn from the Wishart ensemble. These methods are specifically designed for symmetric sectors, allowing us to determine the relative entropy for random states exhibiting $U(1)$ symmetry. This calculation serves as a measure of distinguishability within the symmetry sectors of random states. Our findings reveal that the symmetry-resolved relative entropy of random pure states displays universal statistical behavior. Furthermore, we derive the symmetry-resolved Page curve. These results deepen our understanding of the properties of these random states.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>
