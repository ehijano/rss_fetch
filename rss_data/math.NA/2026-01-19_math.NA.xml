      <title>High-Order Lie Derivatives from Taylor Series in the ADTAYL Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order Lie derivatives are essential in nonlinear systems analysis. If done symbolically, their evaluation becomes increasingly expensive as the order increases. We present a compact and efficient numerical approach for computing Lie derivatives of scalar, vector, and covector fields using the MATLAB ADTAYL package. The method exploits a fact noted by R\"obenack: that these derivatives coincide, up to factorial scaling, with the Taylor coefficients of expressions built from a Taylor expansion about a trajectory point and, when required, the associated variational matrix. Computational results for a gantry crane model demonstrate orders of magnitude speedups over symbolic evaluation using the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox.</description>

      <title>Qualitative reconstruction methods for imaging interior Robin interfaces in EIT from Robin-to-Dirichlet data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse shape problem arising in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for nondestructive testing, in which interior defects are modeled through Robin transmission conditions. Unlike classical formulations, we impose Robin boundary conditions on both the exterior measurement surface and the interior interface, and use the Robin-to-Dirichlet (RtD) map as the available data. Within this setting, we develop qualitative (non-iterative) reconstruction methods based on the Linear Sampling Method (LSM) and the Regularized Factorization Method (RFM), and derive new analytical characterizations that enable these methods to identify interior regions. We further propose a numerical implementation that incorporates regularization strategies and demonstrate, through experiments, that the methods reliably reconstruct interior regions of interest.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Scheme for the Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau Model with BCS Gap Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a structure-preserving scheme for a hybrid model that couples the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation of superconducting vortex dynamics and the nonlinear Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) gap equation. This formulation is consistent with the classical TDGL equation in the near-critical temperature, while extending the applicability of the existing TDGL model to regimes beyond the critical temperature. The resulting system poses significant computational challenges due to its nonlinear and coupled structure. To achieve stable and reliable simulations of the vortex dynamics and accompanying morphological transitions, we develop a maximum bound preserving, energy-stable implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme. The structure-preserving properties of the scheme are rigorously established, ensuring long-time stability and physical consistency. Through two- and three-dimensional simulations, the hybrid model successfully captures the temporal and spatial formation and alignment of vortices and the suppression of superconductivity under increasing magnetic fields, demonstrating both the accuracy and robustness of the proposed computational approach.</description>

      <title>A Non-compact Positivity-Preserving Scheme for Parabolic PDE via Conditional Expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-compact, positivity-preserving scheme for linear non-divergence form parabolic equations. Based on the Feynman-Kac formula, the solution is expressed as a conditional expectation of an associated diffusion process. Instead of using compact Markov chain approximations, we employ a wide stencil scheme to approximate the conditional expectation, ensuring consistency and positivity preservation. This method is effective for anisotropic diffusion with mixed derivatives, where classical schemes often fail unless the covariance matrix is diagonally dominated.
  A key feature of our framework is its robust treatment of boundary conditions, which avoids the accuracy loss commonly encountered in BZ and semi-Lagrangian schemes. For Dirichlet boundaries, we introduce (i) a quad-tree non-uniform stopping time scheme with O($\Delta t^{1/2}$) accuracy and (ii) a quad-tree uniform stopping time scheme with O($\Delta t$) accuracy. For Neumann boundaries, we use discrete specular reflection with O($\Delta t^{1/2}$) convergence, while periodic boundaries are treated using modular wrapping, achieving O($\Delta t$) accuracy. All analyses are conducted under the practical scaling $\Delta t \sim h$.
  Except for the uniform stopping time scheme, all schemes are explicit. The schemes are unconditionally stable and positive preserving, thanks to the probabilistic structure. To ensure consistency, a non-compact stencil is involved, which leads to the large time step constraint $\Delta t \sim h$. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted $L^\infty$ convergence rates for all types of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A model order reduction based adaptive parareal method for time-dependent partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a model order reduction based adaptive parareal method for time-dependent partial differential equations. By using the data obtained by the fine propagator in each iteration of the plain parareal method together with some model order reduction technique, we construct the coarse propagator adaptively in each parareal iteration, and then obtain our adaptive parareal method. We apply this new method to solve some 3D time-dependent advection-diffusion equations with the Kolmogorov flow and the ABC flow. Numerical results show the good performance of our method in simulating long-term evolution problems.</description>

      <title>Exact Constraint Enforcement in Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines using Null-Space Projection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed extreme learning machines (PIELMs) typically impose boundary and initial conditions through penalty terms, yielding only approximate satisfaction that is sensitive to user-specified weights and can propagate errors into the interior solution. This work introduces Null-Space Projected PIELM (NP-PIELM), achieving exact constraint enforcement through algebraic projection in coefficient space. The method exploits the geometric structure of the admissible coefficient manifold, recognizing that it admits a decomposition through the null space of the boundary operator. By characterizing this manifold via a translation-invariant representation and projecting onto the kernel component, optimization is restricted to constraint-preserving directions, transforming the constrained problem into unconstrained least-squares where boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at discrete collocation points. This eliminates penalty coefficients, dual variables, and problem-specific constructions while preserving single-shot training efficiency. Numerical experiments on elliptic and parabolic problems including complex geometries and mixed boundary conditions validate the framework.</description>

      <title>B-spline-Based ALE-MFS Framework for Evolving Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a B-spline based arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method of fundamental solutions (ALE-MFS) for curvature-driven motion of two-dimensional evolving domains. Boundary points move with the material to track the geometric flow, while interior points move within an ALE framework via a harmonic extension of the boundary velocity, computed by a meshless MFS with sources on a fixed auxiliary circle, thus avoiding volumetric meshing. Boundary normals and curvature are reconstructed by an adaptive local B-spline scheme that remains robust for strongly nonconvex shapes and large deformations. A posteriori error estimates are obtained from a hatmatrix formulation of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for both square collocation and zero-padded least-squares systems, and are complemented by maximum principle indicators for harmonic problems. Numerical experiments on circular, star-shaped, and amoeba-like domains show that square collocation suffices for moderately complex geometries, while zero-padded least-squares significantly improves interior velocity regularity and pointwise transport accuracy for strongly nonconvex shapes, without altering the source or collocation sets. The ALE-MFS algorithm also generates high-quality moving meshes for ALE-finite element methods, with larger minimum angles and slower mesh ratio growth than classical FEM mesh-motion strategies, suggesting a practical and easily integrable alternative for challenging moving-interface simulations.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Lagrangian B-Spline Framework for Point Cloud Manifold Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our recent curve-evolution framework based on localized B-spline interpolation to present an adaptive Lagrangian framework for the geometric evolution of point-cloud data representing smooth, codimension-one surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The method constructs overlapping, localized tensor-product B-spline patches, enabling direct, meshless surface evolution from discrete samples. Within each patch, the differentiable B-spline representation yields analytic, high-order estimates of intrinsic geometric invariants, supporting curvature-driven and geometry-coupled flows. The organization of control points facilitates coherent updates of both surface samples and spline coefficients under intrinsic velocity fields. A conditioning-aware formulation of the local interpolation system, combined with a Gauss-Seidel refinement of control points, maintains interpolation quality throughout the evolution. Adaptive knot insertion and point redistribution, guided by geometric error indicators and local sampling density, preserve surface resolution and regularity during deformation. Numerical experiments demonstrate efficient and accurate reproduction of surface evolution phenomena, including mean-curvature flow, anisotropic deformations, and coupled surface-field dynamics, establishing localized B-spline methods as precise and versatile tools for dynamic manifold approximation.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector-based acceleration strategies for gradient-type methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several strategies are described and analyzed to speed-up gradient-type methods when applied to the minimization of strictly convex quadratics and strictly convex functions. The proposed techniques focus on relaxing the traditional optimal step length associated with gradient methods, including the steepest descent (SD) and the minimal residual (MR) methods. Such a relaxation avoids the well-known negative zigzag effect and allows the iterates to move in the entire space which in turn implies that every so often the search direction approaches some eigenvector of the underlying Hessian matrix. The proposed speedups then rely on taking advantage of the properties of the Lanczos method once a search direction that approaches an eigenvector has been identified in order to accelerate the convergence towards the global minimizer. After analyzing the proposed strategies, we illustrate them on the global minimization of strictly convex functions.</description>

      <title>An efficient solver based on low-rank approximation and Neumann matrix series for unsteady diffusion-type partial differential equations with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an efficient numerical solver for unsteady diffusion-type partial differential equations with random coefficients. A major computational challenge in such problems lies in repeatedly handling large-scale linear systems arising from spatial and temporal discretizations under uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose a novel generalized low-rank matrix approximation to represent the stochastic stiffness matrices, and approximate their inverses using the Neumann matrix series expansion. This approach transforms high-dimensional matrix inversion into a sequence of low-dimensional matrix multiplications. Therefore, the solver significantly reduces the computational cost and storage requirements while maintaining high numerical accuracy. The error analysis of the proposed solver is also provided. Finally, we apply the method to two classic uncertainty quantification problems: unsteady stochastic diffusion equations and the associated distributed optimal control problems. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solver.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Randomized Extended Bregman-Kaczmarz Method for Combined Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combined optimization problems that couple data-fidelity and regularization terms arise naturally in a wide range of inverse problems. In this paper, we study an adaptive randomized averaging block extended Bregman-Kaczmarz (aRABEBK) method for solving such problems. The proposed method incorporates iteration-wise relaxation parameters that are automatically adjusted using residual information, allowing for more aggressive step sizes without additional manual tuning. We establish a convergence theory for the proposed framework and derive expected linear convergence rate guarantees. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets for sparse and minimum-norm least-squares problems demonstrate that our aRABEBK method achieves faster convergence and improved robustness compared with state-of-the-art extended Kaczmarz and Bregman-Kaczmarz-type algorithms, including its nonadaptive counterpart.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin schemes for multi-dimensional coupled hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel class of Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin schemes for coupled systems of conservation laws in multiple space dimensions that are separated by a fixed sharp interface is introduced. The schemes are derived from a relaxation approach and a local projection and do not require expensive solutions of nonlinear half-Riemann problems. The underlying Jin-Xin relaxation involves a problem specific modification of the coupling condition at the interface, for which a simple construction algorithm is presented. The schemes are endowed with higher order time discretization by means of strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta methods. These are derived from an asymptotic preserving implicit-explicit treatment of the coupled relaxation system taken to the discrete relaxation limit. In a case study the application to a multi-dimensional fluid-structure coupling problem employing the compressible Euler equations and a linear elastic model is discussed.</description>

      <title>A Machine-Learned Near-Well Model in OPM Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in reservoir simulation increasingly utilize hybrid approaches that couple physics-based simulators with machine-learning (ML) components. ML components offer high fidelity to training data and fast inference, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of complex multi-scale or multi-physics phenomena. Modern reservoir simulators rely on automatic differentiation (AD) to support efficient and flexible strategies for nonlinear solvers, inverse problems, and optimization problems. Efficient hybrid modeling therefore requires tight integration of the ML components with the simulator's AD framework.
  We present the first integration of neural networks into the high-performance reservoir simulator OPM Flow. Networks are trained in TensorFlow and imported into OPM, where they are accessed as native AD functions. This presents an efficient framework for hybrid modeling and enables seamless integration in existing simulator workflows.
  As an application, we introduce a novel, data-driven near-well model. Near-well models are essential in reservoir simulation for accurately representing singular pressure gradients around wells. Commonly used are the Peaceman near-well model and its extensions, or local grid refinement around the wells. Peaceman-type models are limited to simplified flow regimes, whereas local grid refinement is computationally expensive. We address these limitations by training a neural network to infer a Peaceman-like well index from fine-scale ensemble simulations of the near-well region. It is then integrated into OPM Flow with the new framework. Tested on relevant examples for CO$_2$ storage, the method offers high fidelity to fine-scale results at low computational cost, demonstrating the potential of the OPM Flow-Neural Network framework for hybrid modeling.</description>

      <title>A Recovery-Based Error Indicator for Finite Difference Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel recovery-based error indicator for high-order Finite Difference Methods, based on post-processing of the Finite Difference values is presented. The values obtained on the Finite Difference grid are interpolated into a suitable polynomial Finite Element space. A recovery-based error indicator, with the polynomial-preserving property, is then applied to estimate the gradient error. The performance and accuracy of the proposed error indicator are demonstrated through several numerical experiments, including the two-dimensional Poisson problem solved using second- and fourth-order finite difference schemes. Additional experiments are conducted on elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients, as well as on the two and three-dimensional wave equation in homogeneous media with second- and fourth-order finite differences, and in heterogeneous media with second-order finite differences.</description>

      <title>Constructing Orthonormal Rational Function Vectors with an application in Rational Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two algorithms for constructing orthonormal bases of rational function vectors with respect to a discrete inner product, and discuss how to use them for a rational approximation problem. Building on the pencil-based formulation of the inverse generalized eigenvalue problem by Van Buggenhout et al.\ (2022), we extend it to rational vectors of arbitrary length $k$, where the recurrence relations are represented by a pair of $k$-Hessenberg matrices, i.e., matrices with possibly $k$ nonzero subdiagonals. An updating algorithm based on similarity transformations using rotations and a Krylov-type algorithm related to the rational Arnoldi method are derived. The performance is demonstrated on the rational approximation of $\sqrt{z}$ on $[0,1]$, where the optimal lightning + polynomial convergence rate of Herremans, Huybrechs, and Trefethen (2023) is successfully recovered. This illustrates the robustness of the proposed methods for handling exponentially clustered poles near singularities.</description>

      <title>Solving the Fisher nonlinear differential equations via Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Retraining Study and Comparative Analysis with the Finite Difference Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a groundbreaking paradigm in scientific computing, seamlessly integrating the robust framework of deep learning with fundamental physical laws. This paper meticulously applies the standard PINN framework to solve the challenging one-dimensional nonlinear Fisher-KPP equation, a critical model in reaction-diffusion dynamics describing phenomena such as population spread and flame propagation. We detail a comprehensive methodology, encompassing the neural network architecture, the physics-informed loss function, and an in-depth investigation into retraining strategies aimed at optimizing model performance. Our approach is rigorously validated through a direct comparison of the PINN solution against both the known analytical solution and a numerical solution derived from the Finite Difference Method (FDM). Through this work, we elucidate the intricate balance between model complexity, training efficiency, and accuracy. Results highlight the PINN's remarkable capability in accurately approximating the solution to this complex PDE, while also shedding light on the critical aspects and challenges of model retraining, particularly concerning the optimizer's state. This study provides a thorough quantitative error analysis, demonstrating the efficacy of PINNs as a viable and competitive alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving nonlinear differential equations, and discusses their broader applications across various scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Tensor field tomography with attenuation and refraction: adjoint operators for the dynamic case and numerical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with tensor field tomography in a fairly general setting, that takes refraction, attenuation and time-dependence of tensor fields into account. The mathematical model is given by attenuated ray transforms of the fields along geodesic curves corresponding to a Riemannian metric that is defined by the index of refraction. The data are given at the boundary tangent bundle of the domain and it is well-known that they can be characterized as boundary data of a transport equation turning tensor field tomography into an inverse source problem. This way the adjoint of the forward mapping can be computed using the integral representation or, equivalently, associated to a dual transport equation. The article offers and proves two different representations for the adjoint mappings both in the dynamic and static case. The numerical implementation is demonstrated and evaluated for static fields using the damped Landweber method with Nesterov acceleration applied to both, the integral and PDE-based formulations. The transport equations are solved using a viscosity approximation. The error analysis reveals that the integral representation significantly outperforms PDE-based methods in terms of computational efficiency while achieving comparable reconstruction accuracy. The impact of noise and deviations from straight-line trajectories are investigated confirming improved accuracy if refraction is taken into account. We conclude that the inclusion of refraction to the forward model pays in spite of increased numerical cost.</description>

      <title>Efficient error estimators for Generalized Nystr\"om</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms in numerical linear algebra have proven to be effective in ameliorating issues of scalability when working with large matrices, efficiently producing accurate low-rank approximations. A key remaining challenge, however, is to efficiently assess the approximation accuracy of randomized methods without additional expensive matrix accesses. Recent work has addressed this issue by deriving fast leave-one-out error estimators for the randomized SVD and Nystr\"om decomposition, enabling accurate error estimation with no additional matrix accesses. In this work, we extend the leave-one-out framework to the generalized Nystr\"om decomposition, an approach that can be applied to general rectangular matrices. We do this by deriving three new leave-one-out error estimators and validating their effectiveness through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>On spectral interference of the short-time Fourier transform and its nonlinear variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral interference, the frequency counterpart of the beating phenomenon in the time domain, can severely distort time-frequency representations (TFRs) in physical applications. We study this phenomenon for the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a Gaussian window and for nonlinear refinements based on the reassignment method, with an emphasis on the synchrosqueezing transform (SST). Working with a two-component harmonic model, we quantify when STFT can (and cannot) resolve two nearby frequencies: a sharp transition occurs at a critical gap that scales inversely to kernel bandwidth and depends explicitly on the amplitude ratio. Below this threshold, the spectrogram ridges undergo bifurcation and form repeating time-frequency bubbles, which we describe asymptotically and, in the balanced-amplitude case, approximate closely by ellipses. We then analyze the STFT phase, showing a canonical winding behavior, and relate the complex-valued SST reassignment map to a holomorphic structure via the Bargmann transform. In the two-component setting the reassignment rule admits an explicit Mobius-geometry description, sending frequency lines to circular arcs in the complex plane. Finally, viewing SST and reassignment through a measure mapping perspective, we derive small-kernel asymptotics that explain when reassignment sharpens energy and when it produces distorted or misleading TFRs; we also introduce a generalized synchrosqueezing framework that isolates the role of STFT weighting and clarifies how alternative choices can mitigate interference in certain regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces specular differentiation, which generalizes G\^ateaux and Fr\'echet differentiation in normed vector spaces. Fundamental theoretical properties of specular differentiation are investigated, including the Quasi-Mean Value Theorem and Quasi-Fermat's Theorem. As an application, three numerical methods using specular differentiation are devised to optimize nonsmooth convex functions in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods are capable of minimizing non-differentiable functions that classical methods fail to minimize.</description>

      <title>Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Networks for model order reduction of parameterized time-dependent PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for nonlinear Model Order Reduction (MOR) of time-dependent parameterized Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

      <title>Walk based Laplacians for Modeling Diffusion on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for modeling diffusion on complex networks by constructing Laplacian-like operators based on walks around a graph. Our approach introduces a parametric family of walk-based Laplacians that naturally incorporate memory effects by excluding or downweighting backtracking trajectories, where walkers immediately revisit nodes. The framework includes: (i) walk-based Laplacians that count all traversals in the network; (ii) nonbacktracking variants that eliminate immediate reversals; and (iii) backtrack-downweighted variants that provide a continuous interpolation between these two regimes. We establish that these operators extend the definition of the standard Laplacian and also preserve some of its properties. We present efficient algorithms using Krylov subspace methods for computing them, ensuring applicability of our proposed framework to large networks. Extensive numerical experiments on real-world networks validate the modeling flexibility of our approach and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms, including GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Inference via Paired Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Unexpected fault activation due to underground gas storage in produced reservoirs. Part I: Mathematical model and mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underground gas storage (UGS) is a critical technology for managing seasonal gas consumption peaks, increasingly important in the face of market uncertainties. However, safety concerns arise when reactivating pre-existing faults in faulted basins, where human activities may trigger seismic events. Typically, faults are reactivated when shear stress exceeds a critical frictional threshold, but unexpected fault reactivations have been observed during cushion gas injection (CGI) and UGS cycles in the Netherlands, even when the stress regime suggests stability. This two-part study introduces a novel simulation framework to better understand the mechanisms behind fault reactivation in complex settings such as the Rotliegend formation in the Netherlands. A 3D mathematical model coupling frictional contact mechanics in faulted porous rocks with fluid flow allows for predictive analysis of fault behavior. The effect of the storage of different fluids for various purposes, such as the long-term sequestration of CO2, the regular injection and extraction cycles of CH4, and the highly irregular cycles of H2, is investigated with respect to fault activation hazard. The ultimate goal is to define a safe operational bandwidth for UGS activities in faulted reservoirs. Part I of this work presents this comprehensive simulation tool where a slip-weakening constitutive law is introduced to model fault behavior. The approach is designed to address the complex geological setting that characterizes the Rotliegend formation, where multiple factors influence the behavior of fault systems. We succeed in explaining and modeling the occurrence of unexpected fault reactivations. The analysis shows that reactivation during primary production (PP) causes stress redistribution, leading to a new deformed equilibrated configuration.</description>

      <title>Unexpected fault activation due to underground gas storage in produced reservoirs. Part II: Definition of safe operational bandwidths</title>

Abstract: Underground gas storage is a versatile tool for managing energy resources and addressing pressing environmental concerns. While natural gas is stored in geological formations since the early 20th century, hydrogen has recently been considered as a potential candidate toward a more flexible and sustainable energy infrastructure. Furthermore, these formations can additionally capture gases that contribute to climate change, such as CO2. When such operations are implemented in faulted basins, however, safety concerns may arise due to the potential reactivation of pre-existing faults, which could trigger (micro)-seismicity events. In the Netherlands, it has been recently noted that fault reactivation can occur "unexpectedly" during the life of an underground gas storage (UGS) site, even when stress conditions are not expected to cause a failure. The present two-part work aims to develop a modeling framework to investigate the physical mechanisms causing such occurrences in previously produced gas reservoirs and define a safe operational bandwidth for pore pressure variation for UGS operations in the faulted reservoirs of the Upper Rotliegend Group, the Netherlands. This paper investigates in detail the mechanisms and crucial factors that result in fault reactivation at various stages of a UGS. The mathematical and numerical model described in Part I is used, also considering how the presence of stored gases may influence the mechanical properties of the reservoir and caprock, in particular the Young modulus. The study investigates the hazard of fault activation caused by the storage of different fluids for various purposes, such as long-term CO2 sequestration, CH4 and H2 injection and extraction cycles, and N2 injection as cushion gas. The results show how geological configuration, geomechanical properties, and reservoir operating conditions may increase the hazard of fault reactivation.</description>

      <title>A Natural Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Adversarial Neural Network Training on Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06278v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scalable preconditioned primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). We multiply the PDE with a dual test function to obtain an inf-sup problem whose loss functional involves lower-order differential operators. The Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm is then leveraged for this saddle point problem. By introducing suitable precondition operators to the proximal steps in the PDHG algorithm, we obtain an alternative natural gradient ascent-descent optimization scheme for updating the neural network parameters. We apply the Krylov subspace method (MINRES) to evaluate the natural gradients efficiently. Such treatment readily handles the inversion of precondition matrices via matrix-vector multiplication. An \textit{a posteriori} convergence analysis is established for the time-continuous version of the proposed algorithm for general linear PDEs. By incorporating appropriate boundary loss terms, we further obtain a refined \textit{a priori} convergence result for elliptic equations in divergence form. The algorithm is tested on various types of PDEs with dimensions ranging from $1$ to $50$, including linear and nonlinear elliptic equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Monge-Amp\`ere equations stemming from the $L^2$ optimal transport problems. We compare the performance of the proposed method with several commonly used deep learning algorithms such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the DeepRitz method and weak adversarial networks (WANs) using either the Adam or the L-BFGS optimizer. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method performs efficiently and robustly and converges more stably with higher accuracy.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, nonstandard multistep methods are considered. It is shown that under some (sufficient and necessary) conditions, these methods attain the same order as their standard counterparts - to prove this statement, a nonstandard version of Taylor's series is constructed. The preservation of some qualitative properties (boundedness, the linear combination of the components, and a property similar to monotonicity) is also proven for all step sizes. The methods are applied to a one-dimensional equation and a system of equations, in which the numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the Intensity-based Inversion Method for Quantitative Quasi-Static Elastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the intensity-based inversion method (IIM) for quantitative material parameter estimation in quasi-static elastography. In particular, we consider the problem of estimating the material parameters of a given sample from two internal measurements, one obtained before and one after applying some form of deformation. These internal measurements can be obtained via any imaging modality of choice, for example ultrasound, optical coherence or photo-acoustic tomography. Compared to two-step approaches to elastography, which first estimate internal displacement fields or strains and then reconstruct the material parameters from them, the IIM is a one-step approach which computes the material parameters directly from the internal measurements. To do so, the IIM combines image registration together with a model-based, regularized parameter reconstruction approach. This combination has the advantage of avoiding some approximations and derivative computations typically found in two-step approaches, and results in the IIM being generally more stable to measurement noise. In the paper, we provide a full convergence analysis of the IIM within the framework of inverse problems, and detail its application to linear elastography. Furthermore, we discuss the numerical implementation of the IIM and provide numerical examples simulating an optical coherence elastography (OCE) experiment.</description>

Abstract: Complex conjugate matrix equations (CCME) are important in computation and antilinear systems. Existing research mainly focuses on the time-invariant version, while studies on the time-variant version and its solution using artificial neural networks are still lacking. This paper introduces zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) to solve the earliest time-variant CCME. Firstly, the vectorization and Kronecker product in the complex field are defined uniformly. Secondly, Con-CZND1 and Con-CZND2 models are proposed, and their convergence and effectiveness are theoretically proved. Thirdly, numerical experiments confirm their effectiveness and highlight their differences. The results show the advantages of ZND in the complex field compared with that in the real field, and further refine the related theory.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo with one categorical variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) estimation of a multivariate integral where one of the variables takes only a finite number of values. This problem arises when the variable of integration is drawn from a mixture distribution as is common in importance sampling and also arises in some recent work on transport maps. We find that when integration error decreases at an RQMC rate that it is then important to oversample the smallest mixture components instead of using a proportional allocation. This can even improve the rate of convergence. The optimal allocations depend on the possibly unknown convergence rate. Designing the sample with an incorrect assumption on the rate still attains that convergence rate, with an inferior implied constant. The penalty for using a pessimistic rate is typically higher than for using an optimistic one. We also find that for the most accurate RQMC sampling methods, it is advantageous to arrange that our $n=2^m$ randomized Sobol' points split into subsample sizes that are also powers of $2$.</description>
