      <title>Localized and delocalized modes on random geometric graphs in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an extensive investigation of the localization properties of the eigenmodes of the Laplace and adjacency matrix for one-dimensional random geometric graphs. We evaluate the density of states, the probability distribution of the participation ratio and its relation to the eigenvalue. By disentangling the influence of system size, graph component size distribution, mean degree of nodes, network motifs, and degeneracy, we provide a comprehensive understanding of this system. We compare our findings to ordered graphs with the same mean degree and to one-dimensional tight-binding models.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.</description>

      <title>The GINN framework: a stochastic QED correspondence for stability and chaos in deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1) symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel, propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in stochastic QED and wide DNNs.</description>

      <title>Numerical Integration of stochastic differential equations: The Heun Algorithm Revisited and It\^o-Stratonovich Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widely used Heun algorithm for the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is critically re-examined. We discuss and evaluate several alternative implementations, motivated by the fact that the standard Heun scheme is constructed from a low-order integrator. The convergence, stability, and equilibrium properties of these alternatives are assessed through extensive numerical simulations. Our results confirm that the standard Heun scheme remains a benchmark integration algorithm for SDEs due to its robust performance. As a byproduct of this analysis, we also disprove a previous claim in the literature regarding the strong convergence of the Heun scheme.</description>

      <title>Saddle Hierarchy in Dense Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</description>

      <title>Microbiomes Through The Looking Glass: Linking species interactions to dysbiosis through a disordered Lotka-Volterra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has significantly enhanced our ability to study microbial communities. The eubiotic composition of these communities is crucial for maintaining ecological functions and host health. Species diversity is only one facet of a healthy community organization; together with abundance distributions and interaction structures, it shapes reproducible macroecological states, i.e., joint statistical fingerprints that summarize whole-community behavior. Despite recent developments, a theoretical framework connecting empirical data with ecosystem modeling is still in its infancy, particularly in the context of disordered systems. Here, we present a novel framework that couples statistical physics tools for disordered systems with metagenomic data, explicitly linking diversity, interactions, and stability to define and compare these macroecological states. By employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions, we reveal two different emergent patterns of species interaction networks and species abundance distributions for healthy and diseased microbiomes. On the one hand, healthy microbiomes have similar community structures across individuals, characterized by strong species interactions and abundance diversity consistent with neutral stochastic fluctuations. On the other hand, diseased microbiomes show greater variability driven by deterministic factors, thus resulting in less ecologically stable and more divergent communities. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered system theory to characterize microbiomes and to capture the role of ecological interactions on stability and functioning.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi complexity in mean-field disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Configurational entropy, or complexity, plays a critical role in characterizing disordered systems such as glasses, yet its measurement often requires significant computational resources. Recently, R\'enyi entropy, a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, has gained attention across various fields of physics due to its simpler functional form, making it more practical for measurements. In this paper, we compute the R\'enyi version of complexity for prototypical mean-field disordered models, including the random energy model, its generalization, referred to as the random free energy model, and the $p$-spin spherical model. We first demonstrate that the R\'enyi complexity with index $m$ is related to the free energy difference for a generalized annealed Franz-Parisi potential with $m$ clones. Detailed calculations show that for models having one-step replica symmetry breaking (RSB), the R\'enyi complexity vanishes at the Kauzmann transition temperature $T_K$, irrespective of $m&gt;1$, while RSB solutions are required even in the liquid phase. This study strengthens the link between R\'enyi entropy and the physics of disordered systems and provides theoretical insights for its practical measurements.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization in a quantum Ising model with the long-range interaction: Accurate determination of the transition point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Localized states, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore its evolution with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system %remains gapped still has a bulk energy gap, topological edge states and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, this energy gap closes, but it is possible that another bulk gap may open. Such a system possesses multiple states localized at various locations of the lattice. We also establish that topological entanglement entropy and anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Competing edge and bulk localisation in non-reciprocal disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional block disordered subwavelength resonator systems subject to non-reciprocal damping, induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation against the non-Hermitian skin effect, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials.</description>
