      <title>Stochastic Gradients under Nuisances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference are discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy Amortized Bayesian Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amortized Bayesian model comparison (BMC) enables fast probabilistic ranking of models via simulation-based training of neural surrogates. However, the reliability of neural surrogates deteriorates when simulation models are misspecified - the very case where model comparison is most needed. Thus, we supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency (SC) loss on unlabeled real data to improve BMC estimates under empirical distribution shifts. Using a numerical experiment and two case studies with real data, we compare amortized evidence estimates with and without SC against analytic or bridge sampling benchmarks. SC improves calibration under model misspecification when having access to analytic likelihoods. However, it offers limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods, making it most practical for trustworthy BMC when likelihoods are exact.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Chaos Expansion for Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator learning (OL) has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific machine learning (SciML) for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces. One of its main applications is learning the solution operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). While much of the progress in this area has been driven by deep neural network-based approaches such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), recent work has begun to explore traditional machine learning methods for OL. In this work, we introduce polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an OL method. PCE has been widely used for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and has recently gained attention in the context of SciML. For OL, we establish a mathematical framework that enables PCE to approximate operators in both purely data-driven and physics-informed settings. The proposed framework reduces the task of learning the operator to solving a system of equations for the PCE coefficients. Moreover, the framework provides UQ by simply post-processing the PCE coefficients, without any additional computational cost. We apply the proposed method to a diverse set of PDE problems to demonstrate its capabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the strong performance of the proposed method in both OL and UQ tasks, achieving excellent numerical accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Classification under Decision Rule Drift with Application to Optimal Individualized Treatment Rule Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the transfer learning classification framework from regression function-based methods to decision rules. We propose a novel methodology for modeling posterior drift through Bayes decision rules. By exploiting the geometric transformation of the Bayes decision boundary, our method reformulates the problem as a low-dimensional empirical risk minimization problem. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the consistency of our estimators and derive the risk bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the broad applicability of our method by adapting it to the estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules. Extensive simulation studies and analyses of real-world data further demonstrate both superior performance and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Discovering equations from data: symbolic regression in dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression have automated this process. As several methods are available in the literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes, including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world phenomena.</description>

      <title>Latent Factor Point Processes for Patient Representation in Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) contain valuable longitudinal patient-level information, yet most statistical methods reduce the irregular timing of EHR codes into simple counts, thereby discarding rich temporal structure. Existing temporal models often impose restrictive parametric assumptions or are tailored to code level rather than patient-level tasks. We propose the latent factor point process model, which represents code occurrences as a high-dimensional point process whose conditional intensity is driven by a low dimensional latent Poisson process. This low-rank structure reflects the clinical reality that thousands of codes are governed by a small number of underlying disease processes, while enabling statistically efficient estimation in high dimensions. Building on this model, we introduce the Fourier-Eigen embedding, a patient representation constructed from the spectral density matrix of the observed process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that these embeddings efficiently capture subgroup-specific temporal patterns for downstream classification and clustering. Simulations and an application to an Alzheimer's disease EHR cohort demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach in uncovering clinically meaningful heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Stochastic Optimization for Gaussian Processes on Finite Dimensional RKHS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes (GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.</description>

      <title>Dimension Agnostic Testing of Survey Data Credibility through the Lens of Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally, this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the improved interpretability of the independent components.</description>

      <title>Provable Benefits of In-Tool Learning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored. In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization) for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones. We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.</description>

      <title>Fast Convergence Rates for Subsampled Natural Gradient Algorithms on Quadratic Model Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting. Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware optimization strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Soft Kernel Interpolation (SoftKI), a method that combines aspects of Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) and variational inducing point methods, to achieve scalable Gaussian Process (GP) regression on high-dimensional datasets. SoftKI approximates a kernel via softmax interpolation from a smaller number of interpolation points learned by optimizing a combination of the SoftKI marginal log-likelihood (MLL), and when needed, an approximate MLL for improved numerical stability. Consequently, it can overcome the dimensionality scaling challenges that SKI faces when interpolating from a dense and static lattice while retaining the flexibility of variational methods to adapt inducing points to the dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SoftKI across various examples and show that it is competitive with other approximated GP methods when the data dimensionality is modest (around 10).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18283v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Random Feature Representation Boosting (RFRBoost), a novel method for constructing deep residual random feature neural networks (RFNNs) using boosting theory. RFRBoost uses random features at each layer to learn the functional gradient of the network representation, enhancing performance while preserving the convex optimization benefits of RFNNs. In the case of MSE loss, we obtain closed-form solutions to greedy layer-wise boosting with random features. For general loss functions, we show that fitting random feature residual blocks reduces to solving a quadratically constrained least squares problem. Through extensive numerical experiments on tabular datasets for both regression and classification, we show that RFRBoost significantly outperforms RFNNs and end-to-end trained MLP ResNets in the small- to medium-scale regime where RFNNs are typically applied. Moreover, RFRBoost offers substantial computational benefits, and theoretical guarantees stemming from boosting theory.</description>

      <title>The Joys of Categorical Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine Learning model. Its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool, though, has remained conceptually opaque: While Conformal Prediction Regions (CPRs) give an ordinal representation of uncertainty (larger regions typically indicate higher uncertainty), they lack the capability to cardinally quantify it (twice as large regions do not imply twice the uncertainty). We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its cardinal UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a CPR is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break the global coverage guarantee.</description>

      <title>Canonical Bayesian Linear System Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard Bayesian approaches for linear time-invariant (LTI) system identification are hindered by parameter non-identifiability; the resulting complex, multi-modal posteriors make inference inefficient and impractical. We solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful, structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms. Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.</description>

      <title>Extreme Learning Machine for the Characterization of Anomalous Diffusion from Single Trajectories (AnDi-ELM)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the dynamics of natural and artificial systems has provided several examples of deviations from Brownian behavior, generally defined as anomalous diffusion. The investigation of these dynamics can provide a better understanding of diffusing objects and their surrounding media, but a quantitative characterization from individual trajectories is often challenging. Efforts devoted to improving anomalous diffusion detection using classical statistics and machine learning have produced several new methods. Recently, the anomalous diffusion challenge (AnDi, www.andi-challenge.org) was launched to objectively assess these approaches on a common dataset, focusing on three aspects of anomalous diffusion: the inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, I describe a simple approach to tackle the tasks of the AnDi challenge by combining extreme learning machine and feature engineering (AnDi-ELM). The method reaches satisfactory performance while offering a straightforward implementation and fast training time with limited computing resources, making it a suitable tool for fast preliminary screening of anomalous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Categorical Data Clustering via Value Order Estimated Distance Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15189v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering is a popular machine learning technique for data mining that can process and analyze datasets to automatically reveal sample distribution patterns. Since the ubiquitous categorical data naturally lack a well-defined metric space such as the Euclidean distance space of numerical data, the distribution of categorical data is usually under-represented, and thus valuable information can be easily twisted in clustering. This paper, therefore, introduces a novel order distance metric learning approach to intuitively represent categorical attribute values by learning their optimal order relationship and quantifying their distance in a line similar to that of the numerical attributes. Since subjectively created qualitative categorical values involve ambiguity and fuzziness, the order distance metric is learned in the context of clustering. Accordingly, a new joint learning paradigm is developed to alternatively perform clustering and order distance metric learning with low time complexity and a guarantee of convergence. Due to the clustering-friendly order learning mechanism and the homogeneous ordinal nature of the order distance and Euclidean distance, the proposed method achieves superior clustering accuracy on categorical and mixed datasets. More importantly, the learned order distance metric greatly reduces the difficulty of understanding and managing the non-intuitive categorical data. Experiments with ablation studies, significance tests, case studies, etc., have validated the efficacy of the proposed method.

      <title>Bounds in Wasserstein Distance for Locally Stationary Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally stationary (LSPs) constitute an essential modeling paradigm for capturing the nuanced dynamics inherent in time series data whose statistical characteristics, including mean and variance, evolve smoothly across time. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional probability distribution estimator specifically tailored for LSPs, employing the Nadaraya-Watson (NW) kernel smoothing methodology. The NW estimator, a prominent local averaging technique, leverages kernel smoothing to approximate the conditional distribution of a response variable given its covariates. We rigorously establish convergence rates for the NW-based conditional probability estimator in the univariate setting under the Wasserstein metric, providing explicit bounds and conditions that guarantee optimal performance. Extending this theoretical framework, we subsequently generalize our analysis to the multivariate scenario using the sliced Wasserstein distance, an approach particularly advantageous in circumventing the computational and analytical challenges typically associated with high-dimensional settings. To corroborate our theoretical contributions, we conduct extensive numerical simulations on synthetic datasets and provide empirical validations using real-world data, highlighting the estimator's practical relevance and effectiveness in capturing intricate temporal dependencies and underscoring its relevance for analyzing complex nonstationary phenomena.</description>

      <title>LASE: Learned Adjacency Spectral Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We put forth a principled design of a neural architecture to learn nodal Adjacency Spectral Embeddings (ASE) from graph inputs. By bringing to bear the gradient descent (GD) method and leveraging the principle of algorithm unrolling, we truncate and re-interpret each GD iteration as a layer in a graph neural network (GNN) that is trained to approximate the ASE. Accordingly, we call the resulting embeddings and our parametric model Learned ASE (LASE), which is interpretable, parameter efficient, robust to inputs with unobserved edges, and offers controllable complexity during inference. LASE layers combine Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and fully-connected Graph Attention Network (GAT) modules, which is intuitively pleasing since GCN-based local aggregations alone are insufficient to express the sought graph eigenvectors. We propose several refinements to the unrolled LASE architecture (such as sparse attention in the GAT module and decoupled layerwise parameters) that offer favorable approximation error versus computation tradeoffs; even outperforming heavily-optimized eigendecomposition routines from scientific computing libraries. Because LASE is a differentiable function with respect to its parameters as well as its graph input, we can seamlessly integrate it as a trainable module within a larger (semi-)supervised graph representation learning pipeline. The resulting end-to-end system effectively learns ``discriminative ASEs'' that exhibit competitive performance in supervised link prediction and node classification tasks, outperforming a GNN even when the latter is endowed with open loop, meaning task-agnostic, precomputed spectral positional encodings.</description>

      <title>A Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm for Sampling Jeffreys Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference and estimation are fundamental in statistics, system identification, and machine learning. When prior knowledge about the system is available, Bayesian analysis provides a natural framework for encoding it through a prior distribution. In practice, such knowledge is often too vague to specify a full prior distribution, motivating the use of default 'uninformative' priors that minimize subjective bias. Jeffreys prior is an appealing uninformative prior because: (i) it is invariant under any re-parameterization of the model, (ii) it encodes the intrinsic geometric structure of the parameter space through the Fisher information matrix, which in turn enhances the diversity of parameter samples. Despite these benefits, drawing samples from Jeffreys prior is challenging. In this paper, we develop a general sampling scheme using the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm that enables sampling of parameter values from Jeffreys prior; the method extends naturally to nonlinear state-space models. The resulting samples can be directly used in sampling-based system identification methods and Bayesian experiment design, providing an objective, information-geometric description of parameter uncertainty. Several numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Balancing Interference and Correlation in Spatial Experimental Designs: A Causal Graph Cut Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the design of spatial experiments to optimize the amount of information derived from the experimental data and enhance the accuracy of the resulting causal effect estimator. We propose a surrogate function for the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimator, which facilitates the use of classical graph cut algorithms to learn the optimal design. Our proposal offers three key advances: (1) it accommodates moderate to large spatial interference effects; (2) it adapts to different spatial covariance functions; (3) it is computationally efficient. Theoretical results and numerical experiments based on synthetic environments and a dispatch simulator that models a city-scale ridesharing market, further validate the effectiveness of our design. A python implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/CausalGraphCut.</description>

      <title>Transformers Meet In-Context Learning: A Universal Approximation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability to perform new tasks at test time using a handful of input-output examples, without parameter updates. We develop a universal approximation theory to elucidate how transformers enable in-context learning. For a general class of functions (each representing a distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any further weight updates, can predict based on a few noisy in-context examples with vanishingly small risk. Unlike prior work that frames transformers as approximators of optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent) for statistical learning tasks, we integrate Barron's universal function approximation theory with the algorithm approximator viewpoint. Our approach yields approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness of the optimization algorithms being mimicked, extending far beyond convex problems like linear regression. The key is to show that (i) any target function can be nearly linearly represented, with small $\ell_1$-norm, over a set of universal features, and (ii) a transformer can be constructed to find the linear representation -- akin to solving Lasso -- at test time.</description>

      <title>Irredundant $k$-Fold Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall computational cost.</description>

      <title>Inferring processes within dynamic forest models using hybrid modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms. Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step. In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and succession trajectories compared to a mechanistic version of FINN. Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible, improved functional form of the growth process, which we extracted from the DNN using explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.</description>

      <title>Distributed optimization: designed for federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML) framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation, our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant statistical heterogeneity across clients.</description>
