      <title>Multi-dimensional piecewise contractions are asymptotically periodic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise contractions (PCs) are piecewise smooth maps that decrease distance between pair of points in the same domain of continuity. The dynamics of a variety of systems is described by PCs. During the last decade, a lot of effort has been devoted to proving that in parametrized families of one-dimensional PCs, the $\omega$-limit set of a typical PC consists of finitely many periodic orbits while there exist atypical PCs with Cantor $\omega$-limit sets. In this article, we extend these results to the multi-dimensional case. More precisely, we provide criteria to show that an arbitrary family $\{f_{\mu}\}_{\mu\in U}$ of locally bi-Lipschitz piecewise contractions $f_\mu:X\to X$ defined on a compact metric space $X$ is asymptotically periodic for Lebesgue almost every parameter $\mu$ running over an open subset $U$ of the $M$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^M$. As a corollary of our results, we prove that piecewise affine contractions of $\mathbb{R}^d$ defined in generic polyhedral partitions are asymptotically periodic.</description>

      <title>A dynamical view of Tijdeman's solution of the chairman assignment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1980, R. Tijdeman provided an on-line algorithm that generates sequences over a finite alphabet  with minimal discrepancy, that is, such that the occurrence of  each letter optimally tracks its frequency. In this article, we define discrete dynamical systems generating these sequences. The dynamical systems are defined as exchanges of polytopal pieces, yielding cut and project schemes, and they code tilings of the line whose sets of vertices form model sets. We prove that these sequences of low discrepancy are natural codings of toral translations with respect to polytopal atoms, and that they generate a minimal and uniquely ergodic subshift with purely discrete spectrum. Finally, we show that the factor complexity of these sequences is of polynomial growth order $n^{d-1}$, where $d$ is the cardinality of the alphabet.</description>

      <title>GS-PINN: Greedy Sampling for Parameter Estimation in Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equation parameter estimation is a mathematical and computational process used to estimate the unknown parameters in a partial differential equation model from observational data. This paper employs a greedy sampling approach based on the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method to identify the most informative samples in a dataset associated with a partial differential equation to estimate its parameters. Greedy samples are used to train a physics-informed neural network architecture which maps the nonlinear relation between spatio-temporal data and the measured values. To prove the impact of greedy samples on the training of the physics-informed neural network for parameter estimation of a partial differential equation, their performance is compared with random samples taken from the given dataset. Our simulation results show that for all considered partial differential equations, greedy samples outperform random samples, i.e., we can estimate parameters with a significantly lower number of samples while simultaneously reducing the relative estimation error. A Python package is also prepared to support different phases of the proposed algorithm, including data prepossessing, greedy sampling, neural network training, and comparison.</description>

      <title>Horocycle flows on abelian covers of surfaces of negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the unit speed parametrization of the horocycle flow on infinite Abelian covers of compact surfaces of negative curvature. We prove an asymptotic result for the ergodic integrals of sufficiently regular functions. In the case of constant curvature, where the unit speed and the uniformly contracting parametrizations of horocycles coincide, we recover a result by Ledrappier and Sarig. Our method, which does not use symbolic dynamics, is based on a general Fourier decomposition for Abelian covers and on the study of spectral theory of weighted (and twisted) transfer operators for the geodesic flow acting on appropriate anisotropic Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>GN-SINDy: Greedy Sampling Neural Network in Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) is a data-driven technique employed for uncovering and representing the fundamental dynamics of intricate systems based on observational data. However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm. In the implementation phase, to show the effectiveness of GN-SINDy, we compare its results with DeePyMoD by using a Python package that is prepared for this purpose on numerous PDE discovery</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Integral Delay Equations by solving Fredholm equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a stabilizing state-feedback control law for a system represented by a general class of integral delay equations subject to a pointwise and distributed input delay. The proposed controller is defined in terms of integrals of the state and input history over a fixed-length time window. We show that the closed-loop stability is guaranteed, provided the controller integral kernels are solutions to a set of Fredholm equations. The existence of solutions is guaranteed under an appropriate spectral controllability assumption, resulting in an implementable stabilizing control law. The proposed methodology appears simpler and more general compared to existing results in the literature. In particular, under additional regularity assumptions, the proposed approach can be expanded to address the degenerate case where only a distributed control term is present.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of second order singular homogeneous differential equations called the Lane-Emden-type with time singularity in the drift coefficient. Lane-Emden equations are singular initial value problems that model phenomena in astrophysics such as stellar structure and are governed by polytropics with applications in isothermal gas spheres. A hybrid method is proposed to approximate the solution of this type of dynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective SINDy for parameterized model discovery from single transient trajectory data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective technique to produce interpretable models of dynamical systems from time-resolved state data via sparse regression. However, to model parameterized systems, SINDy requires data from transient trajectories for various parameter values over the range of interest, which are typically difficult to acquire experimentally. In this work, we extend SINDy to be able to leverage data on fixed points and/or limit cycles to reduce the number of transient trajectories needed for successful system identification. To achieve this, we incorporate the data on these attractors at various parameter values as constraints in the optimization problem. First, we show that enforcing these as hard constraints leads to an ill-conditioned regression problem due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we implement soft constraints by modifying the cost function to be minimized. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective sparse regression problem where we simultaneously seek to minimize the error of the fit to the transients trajectories and to the data on attractors, while penalizing the number of terms in the model. Our extension, demonstrated on several numerical examples, is more robust to noisy measurements and requires substantially less training data than the original SINDy method to correctly identify a parameterized dynamical system.</description>

      <title>On the basin of attraction of a critical three-cycle of a model for the secant map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the secant method $S_p$ applied to a real polynomial $p$ of degree $d+1$ as a discrete dynamical system on $\mathbb R^2$. If the polynomial $p$ has a local extremum at a point $\alpha$ then the discrete dynamical system generated by the iterates of the secant map exhibits a critical periodic orbit of period 3 or three-cycle at the point $(\alpha,\alpha)$. We propose a simple model map $T_{a,d}$ having a unique fixed point at the origin which encodes the dynamical behaviour of $S_p^3$ at the critical three-cycle. The main goal of the paper is to describe the geometry and topology of the basin of attraction of the origin of $T_{a,d}$ as well as its boundary. Our results concern global, rather than local, dynamical behaviour. They include that the boundary of the basin of attraction is the stable manifold of a fixed point or contains the stable manifold of a two-cycle, depending on the values of the parameters of $d$ (even or odd) and $a\in \mathbb R$ (positive or negative).</description>

      <title>Slow-growing counterexamples to the strong Eremenko Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f\colon\mathbb{C} \to\mathbb{C}$ be a transcendental entire function. In 1989, Eremenko asked the following question concerning the set $I(f)$ of points that tend to infinity under iteration: can every point of $I(f)$ be joined to $\infty$ by a curve in $I(f)$? This is known as the strong Eremenko conjecture and was disproved in 2011 by Rottenfu{\ss}er, R\"uckert, Rempe and Schleicher. The function has relatively small infinite order: it can be chosen such that $\log \log \,\lvert f(z)\rvert = (\log \lvert z\rvert)^{1+o(1)}$ as $f(z)\to \infty$. Moreover, $f$ belongs to the \emph{Eremenko--Lyubich class $\mathcal{B}$}. Rottenfu{\ss}er et al also show that the strong Eremenko conjecture does hold for any $f\in\mathcal{B}$ of finite order. We consider how slow a counterexample $f\in\mathcal{B}$ can grow. Suppose that $\Theta\colon [t_0,\infty)\to [0,\infty)$ satisfies $\Theta(t) \to 0$ and \[ (\log t)^{-\beta \Theta(\log t)}/\Theta(t) \to 0 \quad\text{ as $t\to \infty$} \] for some $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$, along with a certain regularity assumption. Then there exists a counterexample $f\in\mathcal{B}$ as above such that \[ \log \log \vert f(z)\vert = O ( (\log \vert z \vert)^{1 + \Theta( \log \vert z \vert )}) \] as $\vert f(z)\vert \to\infty$. The hypotheses are satisfied, in particular, for $\Theta(t) = 1/(\log \log t)^{\alpha}$, for any $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give analytic proofs of the existence of transversal homoclinic points for a family of non-globally smooth diffeomorphisms having the origin as a fixed point which come out as a truncated map governing the local dynamics near a critical period three cycle associated to the Secant map. Using Moser's version of Birkhoff-Smale's Theorem, we prove that the boundary of the basin of attraction of the origin contains a Cantor-like invariant subset such that the restricted dynamics to it is conjugate to the full shift of $N$-symbols for any integer $N\ge 2$ or infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-cycling fermentation is an automated process used for culturing microorganisms. We consider a model of $n$ distinct species competing for a single non-reproducing nutrient in a self-cycling fermentor in which the nutrient level is used as the decanting condition. The model is formulated in terms of impulsive ordinary differential equations. We prove that two species are able to coexist in the fermentor under certain conditions. We also provide numerical simulations that suggest coexistence of three species is possible and that competitor-mediated coexistence can occur in this case. These results are in contrast to the chemostat, the continuous analogue, where multiple species cannot coexist on a single nonreproducing nutrient.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrable Systems arising from Separation of Variables on S3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the family of quantum integrable systems that arise from separating the Schr\"odinger equation in all 6 separable orthogonal coordinates on the 3 sphere: ellipsoidal, prolate, oblate, Lam\'{e}, spherical and cylindrical. On the one hand each separating coordinate system gives rise to a quantum integrable system on S2 x S2, on the other hand it also leads to families of harmonic polynomials in R4. We show that separation in ellipsoidal coordinates yields a generalised Lam\'{e} equation - a Fuchsian ODE with 5 regular singular points. We seek polynomial solutions so that the eigenfunctions are analytic at all finite singularities. We classify eigenfunctions by their discrete symmetry and compute the joint spectrum for each symmetry class. The latter 5 separable coordinate systems are all degenerations of the ellipsoidal coordinates. We perform similar analyses on these systems and show how the ODEs degenerate in a fashion akin to their respective coordinates. For the prolate system we show that there exists a defect in the joint spectrum which prohibits a global assignment of quantum numbers: the system has quantum monodromy. This is a companion paper to our previous work where the respective classical systems were studied.</description>

      <title>Stability and Diversity in Collective Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0408039</link>
      <description>arXiv:nlin/0408039v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We derive a class of macroscopic differential equations that describe collective adaptation, starting from a discrete-time stochastic microscopic model. The behavior of each agent is a dynamic balance between adaptation that locally achieves the best action and memory loss that leads to randomized behavior. We show that, although individual agents interact with their environment and other agents in a purely self-interested way, macroscopic behavior can be interpreted as game dynamics. Application to several familiar, explicit game interactions shows that the adaptation dynamics exhibits a diversity of collective behaviors. The simplicity of the assumptions underlying the macroscopic equations suggests that these behaviors should be expected broadly in collective adaptation. We also analyze the adaptation dynamics from an information-theoretic viewpoint and discuss self-organization induced by information flux between agents, giving a novel view of collective adaptation.</description>

Abstract: We establish an abstract, effective, exponential large deviations type estimate for Markov systems satisfying a weaker form of mixing. We employ this result to derive such estimates, as well as a central limit theorem, for the skew product encoding a random torus translation, a model we call a mixed random-quasiperiodic dynamical system. This abstract scheme is applicable to many other types of skew product dynamics, including systems for which the spectral gap property for the transition or the transfer operator does not hold.</description>

      <title>The measure transfer for subshifts induced by a morphism of free monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every non-erasing monoid morphism $\sigma: {\cal A}^* \to {\cal B}^*$ induces a measure transfer map $\sigma_X^{\cal M}: {\cal M}(X) \to {\cal M}(\sigma(X))$ between the measure cones ${\cal M}(X)$ and ${\cal M}(\sigma(X))$, associated to any subshift $X \subseteq {\cal A}^\mathbb Z$ and its image subshift $\sigma(X) \subseteq {\cal B}^\mathbb Z$ respectively. We define and study this map in detail and show that it is continuous, linear and functorial. It also turns out to be surjective. Furthermore, an efficient technique to compute the value of the transferred measure $\sigma_X^{\cal M}(\mu)$ on any cylinder $[w]$ (for $w \in {\cal B}^\mathbb Z$) is presented.
  Theorem: If a non-erasing morphism $\sigma: {\cal A}^* \to {\cal B}^*$ is injective on the shift-orbits of some subshift $X \subseteq {\cal A}^\mathbb Z$, then $\sigma^{\cal M}_X$ is bijective.
  The assumption on $\sigma$ that it is "injective on the shift-orbits of $X$" is strictly weaker than "recognizable in $X$", and strictly stronger than "recognizable for aperiodic points in $X$". The last assumption does in general not suffice to obtain the injectivity of the measure transfer map $\sigma_X^{\cal M}$.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the period map for the equation $-\varphi''+\varphi-\varphi^{k}=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07561v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the monotonicity of the period map in terms of the energy levels for certain periodic solutions of the equation $-\varphi''+\varphi-\varphi^{k}=0$, where $k&gt;1$ is a real number. We present a new approach to demonstrate this property, utilizing spectral information of the corresponding linearized operator around the periodic solution and tools related to Floquet theory.</description>

      <title>A new canonical reduction of three-vortex motion and its application to vortex-dipole scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new reduction of the motion of three point vortices in a two-dimensional ideal fluid. This proceeds in two stages: a change of variables to Jacobi coordinates and then a Nambu reduction. The new coordinates demonstrate that the dynamics evolve on a two-dimensional manifold whose topology depends on the sign of a parameter $\kappa_2$ that arises in the reduction. For $\kappa_2&gt;0$, the phase space is spherical, while for $\kappa_2&lt;0$, the dynamics are confined to the upper sheet of a two-sheeted hyperboloid. We contrast this reduction with earlier reduced systems derived by Gr\"obli, Aref, and others in which the dynamics are determined from the pairwise distances between the vortices. The new coordinate system overcomes two related shortcomings of Gr\"obli's reduction that have made understanding the dynamics difficult: their lack of a standard phase plane and their singularity at all configurations in which the vortices are collinear. We apply this to two canonical problems. We first discuss the dynamics of three identical vortices and then consider the scattering of a propagating dipole by a stationary vortex. We show that the points dividing direct and exchange scattering solutions correspond to the locations of the invariant manifolds of equilibria of the reduced equations and relate changes in the scattering diagram as the circulation of one vortex is varied to bifurcations of these equilibria.</description>

      <title>The Riemann hypothesis and dynamics of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new variant of Newton's method -- named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN) -- was recently introduced by the second author. This method has good convergence guarantees, specially concerning finding roots of meromorphic functions. This paper explores using BNQN for the Riemann xi function. We show in particular that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that all attractors of BNQN lie on the critical line. We also explain how an apparent relation between the basins of attraction of BNQN and Voronoi's diagram can be helpful for verifying the Riemann hypothesis or finding a counterexample to it. Some illustrating experimental results are included, which convey some interesting phenomena. The experiments show that BNQN works very stably with highly transcendental functions like the Riemann xi function and its derivatives. Based on insights from the experiments, we discuss some concrete steps on using BNQN towards the Riemann hypothesis. Ideas and results from this paper can be extended to other zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of skew-products over typical IETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove ergodicity of a class of infinite measure preserving systems, called skew-products. More precisely, we consider systems of the form \[ {T_f}:{[0, 1) \times \mathbb{R}}\to{[0, 1) \times \mathbb{R}},\quad {T_f(x, t)}:={(T(x), t+f(x))}, \] where $T$ is an interval exchange transformation and $f$ is a piece-wise constant function with a finite number of discontinuities. We show that such system is ergodic with respect to ${Leb}_{[0,1)\times \mathbb{R}}$ for a typical choice of parameters of $T$ and $f$.</description>

      <title>Global solution and blow-up for the SKT model in Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06045v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the global solution to the reaction diffusion system SKT with homogeneous Newmann boundary conditions. We use the lower and upper solution method and its associated monotone iterations where the reaction functions are locally Lipschitz .We study the blowing-up property of the solution, we give a sufficient condition on the reaction parameters of the model to ensure the blow-up of the solution continuous functions spaces.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>
