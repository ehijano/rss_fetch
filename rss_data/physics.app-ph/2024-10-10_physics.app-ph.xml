      <title>Crystallinity in Niobium oxides: A pathway to mitigate Two-Level System Defects in Niobium 3D Resonator for quantum applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials imperfections in Nniobium based superconducting quantum circuits, in particular, two-level-system (TLS) defects, are a major source of decoherence, ultimately limiting the performance of quantum computation and sensing. Thus, identifying and understanding the microscopic origin of possible TLS defects in these devices and developing strategies to eliminate them is key to superconducting qubit performance improvement. In this paper, we demonstrate the reduction of two-level system losses in three-dimensional superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium resonators by a 10-hour high vacuum (HV) heat treatment at 650{\deg}C, even after exposure to air and high pressure rinsing (HPR). By probing the effect of this annealing on niobium samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we witness an alteration of the native oxide composition re-grown after air exposure and HPR and the creation of nano-scale crystalline oxide regions, which correlates with the measured tenfold quality factor enhancement at low fields of the 1.3 GHz niobium resonator.</description>

      <title>Sub-Millimeter-Scale Measurement of Local Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient Exceeding 100 W/(m^2-K) Using an Optical Pump-Probe Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional methods for measuring the local convective heat transfer coefficient (h_c) often rely on simplifying assumptions that can compromise accuracy. Pump-probe methods like time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) avoid these assumptions but are limited to h_c values larger than 30 kW/(m^2-K) due to modulation frequency constraints. This study introduces an optical-based Square-Pulsed Source (SPS) method, expanding the frequency range from 10 MHz to 1 Hz, enabling measurements of h_c values above 100 W/(m^2-K) with uncertainties under 10%. The efficacy of the SPS method is demonstrated through measurements of local h_c in an impingement heat transfer process with a single round gas jet. The local Nusselt number distribution is compared with existing literature correlations, offering insights into convective heat transfer phenomena. This study presents a novel tool for measuring local intrinsic convective heat transfer coefficients, enhancing the understanding of local convective heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Homogenized Models of Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of mechanical metamaterials are prohibitively expensive due to the separation of scales between the lattice and the macrostructural size. Hence, multiscale continuum analysis plays a pivotal role in the computational modeling of metastructures at macroscopic scales. In the present work, we assess the continuum limit of mechanical metamaterials via homogenized models derived rigorously from variational methods. It is shown through multiple examples that micropolar-type effective energies, derived naturally from analysis, properly capture the kinematics of discrete lattices in two and three dimensions. Moreover, the convergence of the discrete energy to the continuum limit is shown numerically. We provide open-source computational implementations for all examples, including both discrete and homogenized models.</description>

      <title>Dilated space-and-wavelength selective crosspoint optical switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated switches that are both space and wavelength selective are a highly promising technology for data-intensive applications as they benefit from multi-dimensional manipulation of optical signals. However, scaling these switches normally poses stringent challenges such as increased fabrication complexity and control difficulties, due to the growing number of switching elements. In this work, we propose a novel dilated crosspoint topology, which efficiently handles both space and wavelength selective switching, while reducing the required switching element count by an order of magnitude compared to reported designs. To the best of our knowledge, our design requires the fewest switching elements for an equivalent routing paths number and it fully cancels the first-order in-band crosstalk. We demonstrate such an ultra-compact space-and-wavelength-selective switch (SWSS) at a scale of 4{\times}4{\times}4{\lambda} on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Experimental results reveal that the switch achieves an insertion loss ranging from 2.3 dB to 8.6 dB and crosstalk levels in between -35.3 dB and -59.7 dB. The add-drop microring-resonators (MRRs) are equipped with micro-heaters, exhibiting a rise and fall time of 46 {\mu}s and 0.33 {\mu}s, respectively. These performance characteristics highlight the switch's ultra-low element count and crosstalk with low insertion loss, making it a promising candidate for advanced data center applications.</description>

      <title>Infrared Bolometers Based on 40-nm-Thick Nano-Thermoelectric Silicon Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of the-art infrared photodetectors operating in the mid- and long-wavelength infrared (MWIR and LWIR) are largely dominated by cryogenically cooled quantum sensors when the target is the highest sensitivity and detection speeds. Nano-thermoelectrics provide a route towards competitive uncooled infrared bolometer technology that can obtain high speed and sensitivity, low-power operation, and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers with fast and high-sensitivity response to LWIR around 10 $\mu$m. These devices are based on ultra-thin silicon membranes that utilize the dimensional scaling of silicon nanomembranes in thermoelectric elements and are combined with metallic nanomembranes with subwavelength absorber structures. The fast device performance stems from a low heat capacity design where the thermoelectric beams act both as mechanical supports and transducer elements. Furthermore, by scaling down the thickness of the thermoelectric beams the thermal conductivity is reduced owing to enhanced phonon boundary scattering, resulting in increased sensitivity. The nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers are based on 40-nm-thick n- and p-type silicon membranes with LWIR (voltage) responsivities up to 1636 V/W and 1350 V/W and time constants in the range of 300-600 $\mu$s, resulting in specific detectivities up to $1.56\times10^8$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W. We also investigate the use of a heavily doped N++ substrate to increase optical cavity back reflection, resulting in an increased Si substrate reflectance from 30% to 70%-75% for wavelengths between 8-10 $\mu$m, resulting in an increase in device responsivity by approximately 20%.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian Dirac cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic quasiparticle excitations arising from band degeneracies in crystals not only offer exciting chances to test hypotheses in particle physics but also play crucial roles in the transport and topological properties of materials and metamaterials. Quasiparticles are commonly described by low-energy Hamiltonians that are Hermitian, while non-Hermiticity is usually considered detrimental to quasiparticle physics. In this work, we show that such an assumption of Hermiticity can be lifted to bring quasiparticles into non-Hermitian systems. We propose a concrete lattice model containing two non-Hermitian Dirac cones, with one hosting amplifying Dirac quasiparticles and the other hosting decaying ones. The lifetime contrast between the Dirac cones at the two valleys imposes an ultra-strong valley selection rule not seen in any Hermitian systems: only one valley can survive in the long time limit regardless of the excitation, lattice shape and other details. This property leads to an effective parity anomaly with a single Dirac cone and offers a simple way to generate vortex states in the massive case. The non-Hermitian feature of the bulk Dirac cones can also be generalized to the boundary, giving rise to valley kink states with valley-locked lifetimes. This makes the kink states effectively unidirectional and more resistant against inter-valley scattering. All these phenomena are experimentally demonstrated in a non-Hermitian electric circuit lattice.</description>

      <title>Electrodeposition of amorphous molybdenum sulfo-selenide as a low-cost catalyst</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overall, the MoSx system has shown greater catalytic activity over the traditional MoS2 based systems due to the absence of discrete basal plane, and differing structural arrangements. This increases the overall catalytic site density alongside adequate electronic conductivity from short-range atomic arrangements that allow for use in electrochemical processes. Here we translate prior efforts to improve electrocatalysis via Se incorporation within the crystalline system to the polymeric system, as several of the active sites in the a-MoSx have similar motifs and bonding environments as those found in MoS2. We use a single-electrolyte electrodeposition synthesis technique in order to provide a scalable, low-cost material. We demonstrate the influence of the electrolyte conditions on the films physical, chemical, electronic, and catalytic properties as a function of selenium content through a comprehensive study via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods. Together, these results highlight selenium's role in the Se-MoSx system in promoting the catalytic efficacy of these catalysts.</description>

      <title>Praseodymium doping effect on the superconducting properties of FeSe0.5Te0.5 bulks under ambient and high-pressure growth conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 (Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5; x = 0 to 0.3) bulks are prepared by conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas pressure and high temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) methods. These bulks are well characterized by structural and microstructural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, transport, and magnetic measurements. The HP-HTS process of the parent bulks has enhanced the onset transition temperature (Tconset) by 1.5 K and the critical current density (Jc) by two orders of magnitude compared to the CSP method. Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 up to 10% doping content prepared, either CSP or HP-HTS, slightly increases the unit cell volume, and high-pressure growth produces an almost pure superconducting phase, which confirms the successful Pr-doping at Fe sites. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations suggest the substitution of Pr-atoms in the interlayer spacing of Fe(Se,Te) lattice. High-pressure growth of Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5 also makes the sample less dense compared to the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Transport and magnetic measurements depict that Tconset is almost unaffected by Pr doping, whereas Jc of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 is enhanced by one order of magnitude relative to the parent sample developed by CSP but lower than that of the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Hence, Pr doping at Fe sites preserves Tconset and improves Jc of FeSe0.5Te0.5 regardless of the doping contents and growth conditions. These results are promising for the practical application of iron-based superconductors to improve Jc properties without affecting Tconset through CSP process and congruent with discoveries from other superconductors, like cuprates and MgB2.</description>

      <title>Broken intrinsic symmetry induced magnon-magnon coupling in synthetic ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets offer rich magnon energy spectra in which optical and acoustic magnon branches can hybridize. Here, we demonstrate a broken intrinsic symmetry induced coupling of acoustic and optical magnons in a synthetic ferrimagnet consisting of two dissimilar antiferromagnetically interacting ferromagnetic metals. Two distinct magnon modes hybridize at degeneracy points, as indicated by an avoided level-crossing. The avoided level-crossing gap depends on the interlayer exchange interaction between the magnetic layers, which can be controlled by adjusting the non-magnetic interlayer thickness. An exceptionally large avoided level crossing gap of 6 GHz is revealed, exceeding the coupling strength that is typically found in other magnonic hybrid systems based on a coupling of magnons with photons or magnons and phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic control over the properties of low-dimensional materials with nanoscale precision is a long-sought goal. Mastering this capability has a transformative impact on the design of multifunctional electrical and optical devices. Here, we present an ion-assisted synthetic technique that enables precise control over the material composition and energy landscape of two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals. Our method transforms binary transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), like MoSe$_2$, into ternary MoS$_{2\alpha}$Se$_{2(1-{\alpha}})$ alloys with systematically adjustable compositions, ${\alpha}$. By piecewise assembly of the lateral, compositionally modulated MoS$_{2\alpha}$Se$_{2(1-{\alpha})}$ segments within 2D atomic layers, we present a synthetic pathway towards the realization of multi-compositional designer materials. Our technique enables the fabrication of complex structures with arbitrary boundaries, dimensions as small as 30 nm, and fully customizable energy landscapes. Our optical characterizations further showcase the potential for implementing tailored optoelectronics in these engineered 2D crystals.</description>

      <title>Observation of polaronic state assisted sub-bandgap saturable absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polaronic effects involving stabilization of localized charge character by structural deformations and polarizations have attracted considerable investigations in soft lattice lead halide perovskites. However, the concept of polaron assisted nonlinear photonics remains largely unexplored, which has a wide range of applications from optoelectronics to telecommunications and quantum technologies. Here, we report the first observation of the polaronic state assisted saturable absorption through subbandgap excitation with a redshift exceeding 60 meV. By combining photoluminescence, transient absorption measurements and density functional theory calculations, we explicate that the anomalous nonlinear saturable absorption is caused by the transient picosecond timescale polaronic state formed by strong carrier exciton phonon coupling effect. The bandgap fluctuation can be further tuned through exciton phonon coupling of perovskites with different Young's modulus. This suggests that we can design targeted soft lattice lead halide perovskite with a specific structure to effectively manipulate exciton phonon coupling and exciton polaron formation. These findings profoundly expand our understanding of exciton polaronic nonlinear optics physics and provide an ideal platform for developing actively tunable nonlinear photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Thermal Conductivity of 3D Printed Graphene Enhanced Thermoplastic Polyurethanes Structure toward Photothermal Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar photothermal conversion is one of the most straightforward methods to utilize solar energy. In this manuscript, a novel double-layer structure constructed of graphene enhanced thermoplastic polyurethanes (G-TPU) and neat thermoplastic polyurethanes (N-TPU) was developed via fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing process. The developed G-TPU-N-TPU double-layer structure exhibited anisotropic thermal conductivity that simultaneously satisfied high in-plane (IP) thermal conductivity and low through-plane (TP) thermal conductivity. The top G-TPU layer essentially offered a high IP thermal conductivity of 4.54 W(mK) that lead to overall structure anisotropic thermal conductivity ratio (TCIP-TCTP) of 8. And the low thermal conductivity in the TP direction led to the heat retention effects for thermal storage. Nonetheless, the exceptional photothermal conversion effect of graphene flakes guaranteed the superior photothermal performance that was promising in the photothermal de-icing and infrared labels applications. Finally, the graphene flake enhancement in the mechanical properties of the G-TPU-N-TPU double layer structure was also evaluated that contributed to excellent impact resistance with a puncture energy reaching 12.86 J, and extraordinary wear resistance with a small friction coefficient of 0.1 over 1000 cycles, which ensured the structure suitable for applications at harsh environment.</description>

      <title>Analytic model of stable shock-like structures in laser interaction with underdense plasma for identifying of phase and polarization dependent regime of laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical model describing a stable shock-like structure that is formed when an ultra-intense laser propagates through an underdense plasma. It is shown that such structures exist in a wide range of laser-plasma parameters, with a unique sub-luminal shock front velocity for each parameter. Numerical methods to accurately describe such shock-front is developed. The formalism is applied to describe the parameter space in which the Carrier-Envelope-Phase (CEP) effect under which phase and polarization dependent super-ponderomotive effects becomes significant. The developed formalism will enable quick identification of regimes in which CEP effects become significant, expediting designing of Laser Wakefield Accelerators operating in the superponderomotive regime.</description>

      <title>Order in disorder: oxygen vacancy driven electronic phase separation of LaNiO3-x epitaxial thin film surface investigated by scanning probe microscopy</title>

Abstract: Oxygen vacancies in nickelates are known to introduce a variety of emergent phenomena and are considered to significantly affect conductivity. Few studies have examined real-space evidence for oxygen vacancies on the surface, particularly using scanning probe microscopy. Understanding the surface composition, both structurally and chemically, is crucial for the application of nickelates, such as in electrochemical water splitting reactions as catalysts. In this study, we investigate a 20 nm epitaxial LaNiO3-x(LNO) film grown on SrTiO3 (STO) via pulsed laser deposition. We examine the surface of this film using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and reveal a complex surface morphology composed of densely packed crystalline nanometer-sized circular features with radius ranging from 10 to 20 nm. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed an electronic inhomogeneity, or phase separation, in nanoscale islands of semi-conductive nature embedded within a metallic matrix. This change in the electronic density of the states was associated with increased concentration of oxygen vacancies. Further evidence for significant oxygen vacancies at the surface was inferred by examining scanning tunneling tip-induced surface degradation. The strong electric field between the tip and sample likely facilitates oxygen removal in a vacuum environment, increasing the formation of vacancies, which can lead to the breakdown of the crystal structure. This provides insight into the possible origin of the chemical surface transformation during the electrochemical water splitting reaction of this nickelate.</description>

      <title>Laser polarization as a critical factor on the SERS-based molecular sensing performance of nano-gapped Au nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, Au dimer-based nanostructures are exhaustively studied due to their outstanding potential as plasmonic nanoantennas for future applications in high-sensitivity molecular sensing by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). In this work, we analyze nano-gapped Au nanowires (NWs) or Au-NWs dimers for designing efficient nanoantennas, reporting an exhaustive study about dimer length and laser polarization orientation effects on their SERS-based molecular sensing performance. Arrays of nanoantennas with gaps about 22 (+/-)4 [nm], nominal square cross-sections of 60 [nm] x 60 [nm], and different lengths from 300 [nm] up to 1200 [nm] were fabricated by Au evaporation and subsequent e-beam lithography. SERS performance was studied by confocal Raman microscopy using a linearly-polarized 633 [nm] laser. A critical impact of the polarization alignment on the spectral resolution of the studied Raman marker imprint was observed. Results show that the Raman signal is maximized by aligning the polarization orientation with the nanowire long axis, it is reduced by increasing the relative angle, and it is abruptly minimized when both are perpendicular. These observations were consistent with numerical simulations carried out by the FDTD method, which predict a similar dependence between the orientation of linearly-polarized light and electric-near field amplification in the nano-gap zone. Our results provide an interesting paradigm and relevant insights in determining the role of laser polarization on the Raman signal enhancement in nano-gapped Au nanowires, showing the key role of this measurement condition on the SERS-based molecular sensing efficiency of this kind of nanostructure.</description>

      <title>Oxide Membranes from Bulk Micro-Machining of SrTiO3 substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspended micro-structures based on complex oxides relies on surface micro-machining processes such as those based on sacrificial layers. These processes prevent to physically access the microstructures from both sides, as substantial part of the substrate is not removed. In this work, we develop a bulk micromachining protocol of a commonly used substrate employed in oxide thin film deposition. We realize suspended oxide thin film devices by fabricating pass-through holes across SrTiO3(100) or SrTiO3(110) substrates. Careful calibration of anisotropic etching rates allows controlling the final geometry of the aperture in the substrate in a predictable way. As demonstrators of possible device geometries, we present clamped membranes and trampolines of (La,Sr)MnO3, a conductive magnetic oxide, and a suspended trampoline resonator carved from the SrTiO3 substrate itself. Reported protocols can be readily extended to a broad variety of other complex oxides so to extend the application of membranes technology beyond those of commercially-available silicon compounds.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Blackbody Absorption: Transcending Causality Limits through Instability-Induced Softness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By coupling unstable components, we demonstrate a novel approach that reduces static modulus to zero, eliminating causality-imposed absorption limitations in acoustics. Our heuristic model simulations achieve ultra-broadband absorption over 99% for wavelengths greater than 132 times the absorber thickness. Theoretical analysis further proves this strategy can approach ideal blackbody behavior with infinitesimal thickness. These findings suggest fundamental physical laws no longer prevent true blackbody absorption realization; the only remaining obstacle is the material limitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequency Combs with Path Identity for Quantum Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensing promises to revolutionize sensing applications by employing quantum states of light or matter as sensing probes. Photons are the clear choice as quantum probes for remote sensing because they can travel to and interact with a distant target. Existing schemes are mainly based on the quantum illumination framework, which requires a quantum memory to store a single photon of an initially entangled pair until its twin reflects off a target and returns for final correlation measurements. Existing demonstrations are limited to tabletop experiments, and expanding the sensing range faces various roadblocks, including long-time quantum storage and photon loss and noise when transmitting quantum signals over long distances. We propose a novel quantum sensing framework that addresses these challenges using quantum frequency combs with path identity for remote sensing of signatures (``qCOMBPASS"). The combination of one key quantum phenomenon and two quantum resources, namely quantum induced coherence by path identity, quantum frequency combs, and two-mode squeezed light, allows for quantum remote sensing without requiring a quantum memory. The proposed scheme is akin to a quantum radar based on entangled frequency comb pairs that uses path identity to detect/range/sense a remote target of interest by measuring pulses of one comb in the pair that never flew to target, but that contains target information ``teleported" by quantum-induced coherence from the other comb in the pair that did fly to target but is not detected.</description>

      <title>Stress-induced Artificial neuron spiking in Diffusive memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusive memristors owing to their ability to produce current spiking when a constant or slowly changing voltage is applied are competitive candidates for the development of artificial electronic neurons. These artificial neurons can be integrated into various prospective autonomous and robotic systems as sensors, e.g. ones implementing object grasping and classification. We report here Ag nanoparticle-based diffusive memristor prepared on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate in which the electric spiking behaviour was induced by the electric voltage under an additional stimulus of external mechanical impact. By changing the magnitude and frequency of the mechanical impact, we are able to manipulate the spiking response of our artificial neuron. This functionality to control the spiking characterstics paves a pathway for the development of touch-perception sensors that can convert local pressure into electrical spikes for further processing in neural networks. We have proposed a mathematical model which captures the operation principle of the fabricated memristive sensors and qualitatively describes the measured spiking behaviour.</description>

      <title>Transient current responses of organic electrochemical transistors: Evaluating ion diffusion, chemical capacitance, and series elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the successful implementation of organic electrochemical transistors in neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and real-time sensing applications it is essential to understand the factors that influence device switching times. Here we describe a physical-electrochemical model of the transient response to a step of the gate voltage. The model incorporates (1) ion diffusion inside the channel that governs the electronic conductivity, (2) horizontal electron transport, and (3) the external elements (capacitance, ionic resistance) of the ion dynamics in the electrolyte. We find a general expression of two different time constants that determine the vertical insertion process in terms of the kinetic parameters, in addition to the electronic transit time. We highlight the central role of the chemical capacitance in determining the modulation of the lateral conductivity. The different types of response of the drain current are classified, and we discuss the significance for synaptic operation in neuromorphic circuits. The model is confirmed by detailed simulations that enable to visualize the different ions distributions and dynamics.</description>

      <title>120 GOPS Photonic Tensor Core in Thin-film Lithium Niobate for Inference and in-situ Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonics offers a transformative approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and neuromorphic computing by enabling low-latency, high-speed, and energy-efficient computations. However, conventional photonic tensor cores face significant challenges in constructing large-scale photonic neuromorphic networks. Here, we propose a fully integrated photonic tensor core, consisting of only two thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, a III-V laser, and a charge-integration photoreceiver. Despite its simple architecture, it is capable of implementing an entire layer of a neural network with a computational speed of 120 GOPS, while also allowing flexible adjustment of the number of inputs (fan-in) and outputs (fan-out). Our tensor core supports rapid in-situ training with a weight update speed of 60 GHz. Furthermore, it successfully classifies (supervised learning) and clusters (unsupervised learning) 112 * 112-pixel images through in-situ training. To enable in-situ training for clustering AI tasks, we offer a solution for performing multiplications between two negative numbers.</description>

      <title>Versatile Optical Frequency Division with Kerr-induced Synchronization at Tunable Microcomb Synthetic Dispersive Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) provides a new key tool for the control and stabilization of the repetition rate of a cavity soliton frequency comb. It enables direct external control of a given comb tooth of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) thanks to its capture by an injected reference laser. Efficient KIS requires its coupling energy to be sufficiently large, and hence both the comb tooth and intracavity reference power must be optimized, which can be achieved through higher-order dispersion that enables phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), where comb teeth are on resonance. However, such a design is highly restrictive, preventing arbitrary use of reference wavelengths away from the DW(s). In particular, for large spectral separations from the main pump the cavity dispersion yields large detuning between comb teeth and their respective cavity resonances, thereby decreasing the coupling energy and rendering KIS to be highly inefficient or practically impossible. Here, we demonstrate an alternative KIS method where efficient synchronization can be tailored at arbitrary modes as needed. Using a multi-color DKS created from multi-pumping a microresonator, a synthetic DW at the second-color wavepacket can be selectively created where otherwise dispersion is far too large for KIS to be experimentally feasible. Since a unique group velocity for both colors exists thanks to cross-phase modulation, the repetition rate disciplining of the secondary color wavepacket through its KIS automatically translates into the DKS microcomb control. We first investigate this color-KIS phenomenon theoretically, and then experimentally demonstrate its control and tuning of the soliton microcomb repetition rate. As a consequence, we demonstrate optical frequency division that is uncoupled from the main pump that generates the DKS.</description>

      <title>The impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a &gt;10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Algebra Made Simple for Thermoelectric Generator Module Performance Prediction under Constant Seebeck-Coefficient Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While thermoelectric material performances can be estimated using the ZT, predicting the performance of thermoelectric generator modules (TGMs) is complex due to the non-linearity and non-locality of the thermoelectric differential equations. Here, we present a simplified thermoelectric algebra framework for predicting TGM performance within the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA). First, we revisit the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Model (CSM) to transform the differential equations into exact algebraic equations for thermoelectric heat flux and conversion efficiency in terms of the load resistance ratio and relative Fourier heat flux. Next, we introduce the CSA, where the Thomson term is neglected, and the device parameters are assumed to be fixed. We define average thermoelectric properties and device parameters at the zero-current condition using a simple temperature integral. Finally, we derive approximate thermoelectric algebraic equations for voltage, resistance, heat flux, and conversion efficiency as functions of current. We numerically validate that the CSA formalism is superior to other single-parameter theories, such as peak-ZT, integral-ZT, and the generic engineering-ZT, in predicting efficiency. The relative standard error in optimal efficiency is less than 11% for average ZT values not exceeding 2. By combining CSM and CSA, TGM performance can be easily estimated without the need for calculus or solving differential equations.</description>
