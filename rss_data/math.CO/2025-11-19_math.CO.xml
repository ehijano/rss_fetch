      <title>Chow polynomials of rank-uniform labeled posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop the theory of UMEL-shellable posets. These are posets equipped with an edge-lexicographical labeling satisfying certain uniformity and monotonicity properties. This framework encompasses classical families of combinatorial geometries, including uniform matroids, projective and affine geometries, braid matroids of type A and B, and all Dowling geometries. It also comprises all rank-uniform supersolvable lattices, and therefore also all rank-uniform distributive lattices. Our main result establishes real-rootedness phenomena for the Chow polynomials, the augmented Chow polynomials, and the chain polynomials associated with those posets, thus making simultaneous progress towards conjectures by Ferroni--Schr\"oter, Huh--Stevens, and Athanasiadis--Kalampogia-Evangelinou. In the special case of lattices of flats of matroids, the (augmented) Chow polynomials coincide with the Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of the Chow ring associated to the smooth and generally noncompact toric varieties of the (augmented) Bergman fan of the matroid, whereas the chain polynomial encodes the Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of the Stanley--Reisner ring of the Bergman complex of the matroid. Therefore, these real-rootedness results are tightly linked to the study of these algebro-geometric structures in matroid theory.</description>

      <title>Signed permutations and degree-one dot action representations for types B and C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spline is an assignment of polynomials to the vertices of a graph, where the difference of two polynomials along an edge must belong to the ideal labeling that edge. We consider a ring of splines $\mathcal{M}_{H}$ constructed on a graph whose vertices are the Weyl group $\mathfrak{W}_n$ of signed permutations, and whose edges and edge-ideals are defined using an order ideal $H$ of positive roots. These splines are a module over the polynomial ring in two ways, and a $\mathfrak{W}_n$-module by the dot action. These structures on $\mathcal{M}_{H}$ give rise to the graded left and right dot action representations of $\mathfrak{W}_n$. The left representation is the type B/C generalization of the type A dot action for regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties (and thus, chromatic quasisymmetric functions), and the right representation is the same for corresponding manifolds of isospectral matrices (and thus, unicellular LLT polynomials). This paper gives explicit module generators for the degree-one graded piece of $\mathcal{M}_{H}$ and computes the degree-one piece of the both dot action representations for all $H$ using the combinatorial data of $H$.</description>

      <title>Switching Rook Polynomials of Collections of Cells: Palindromicity and Domino-Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rook polynomial is a generating function that enumerates the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a collection of cells, interpreted as a pruned chessboard. A central variant is the switching rook polynomial, which counts equivalence classes of $k$ non-attacking rook placements under switching operations. It is conjectured that this polynomial coincides with the $h$-polynomial of the associated $K$-algebra. In this context, palindromicity plays a crucial role, as it reflects the algebraic property of Gorensteinness. In this paper, we introduce a new combinatorial property, called domino-stability, and we characterize all collections of cells whose switching rook polynomial is palindromic in terms of this property. Finally, we present an application of our combinatorial result to commutative and computational algebra, offering new insight into the characterization of Gorenstein $K$-algebras arising from collections of cells.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal graphs for $F_6$-free graphs with even size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_l$ be the fan graph obtained by joining a vertex with a path on $l-1$ vertices. Yu, Li and Peng [Discrete Math. 346 (2023)] conjectured that if the number of edges of $G$ is $m$ and the spectral radius $\lambda(G)&gt;\frac{k-1+\sqrt{4m-k^2+1}}{2}$, then $G$ contains a $F_{2k+1}$ and $F_{2k+2}$, unless $G=K_{k}\vee (\frac{m}{k}-\frac{k-1}{2})K_1$. The case $k\geq 3$ of the above conjecture has been confirmed by Li, Zhao and Zou [J. Graph theory 110 (2025)]. Zhang and Wang [Discrete Math. 347 (2024)], Yu, Li and Peng [Discrete Math. 348 (2025)], Gao and Li [Discrete Math. 349 (2026)] confirmed the case $k=2$. However, the extremal graphs for the case $k=2$ only exist when $m$ is odd. The case with $m$ even has not been determined. In this paper, we characterize the extremal graph for $F_6$ and even $m\ge 3000$.</description>

      <title>On the number of small edge-weighted subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgraph counting is a fundamental task that underpins several network analysis methodologies, including community detection and graph two-sample tests. Counting subgraphs is a computationally intensive problem. Substantial research has focused on developing efficient algorithms and strategies to make it feasible for larger unweighted graphs. Implementing those algorithms can be a significant hurdle for data professionals or researchers with limited expertise in algorithmic principles and programming. Furthermore, many real-world networks are weighted. Computing the number of weighted subgraphs in weighted networks presents a computational challenge, as no efficient algorithm exists for the worst-case scenario. In this paper, we derive explicit formulas for counting small edge-weighted subgraphs using the weighted adjacency matrix. These formulas are applicable to unweighted networks, offering a simple and highly practical analytical tool for researchers across various scientific domains. In addition, we introduce a generalized methodology for calculating arbitrary weighted subgraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of $2$-designs with $\lambda\ge (r,\lambda)^2$ admitting a flag-transitive automorphism group $G$. The group $G$ has been shown to be point-primitive of either almost simple or affine type. In this paper, we classify the $2$-designs with $\lambda \geq (r,\lambda)^2&gt;1$ admitting a flag-transitive almost simple automorphism group with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_n(q)$ or $\mathrm{PSU}_n(q)$ for $n \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>On an extension problem on the moment curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for $2\le d\le 4$, every finite geometric simplicial complex $\Delta$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with vertices on the moment curve can be extended to a triangulation $T$ of the cyclic polytope $C$ where $\Delta, T$ and $C$ all have the same vertex set. Further, for $d\ge 5$ we construct for every $n\ge d+3$ complexes $\Delta$ on $n$ vertices for which no such triangulations $T$ exist.
  Our result for $d=4$ has the following novel algebraic application, due to a correspondence by Oppermann and Thomas (JEMS, 2012): every maximal rigid object in $\mathcal{O}_{A_n^{2}}$ is cluster tilting, where $\mathcal{O}_{A_n^{\delta}}$ denotes a higher dimensional cluster category introduced by Oppermann and Thomas for $A_n^\delta$, where $A_n^\delta$ denotes a higher Auslander algebra of linearly oriented type $A$.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Tur\'an problems for forbidden subposets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{G}$ of sets is a copy of a poset $(P,\leqslant)$ if $(\mathcal{G},\subseteq)$ is isomorphic to $(P,\leqslant)$. The forbidden subposet problem asks for determining $La^*(n,P)$, the maximum size of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ that does not contain any copy of $P$. We study the rainbow version of this problem: what is the maximum size $La_R^*(n,P)$ of a family $\mathcal{F}=\cup_{i=1}^mA^i$ such that all $A^i$ are antichains and there is no copy of $P$ with all sets coming from distinct $A^i$ or equivalently $\mathcal{F}$ admits a proper coloring (sets $F\subset F'$ must receive different colors) with no rainbow copy of $P$.
  A poset $(Q,\leqslant')$ rainbow forces $(P,\leqslant)$ if any proper coloring $c$ of $Q$ ($q\leqslant' q'$ or $q'\leqslant' q$ implies $c(q)\neq c(q')$) admits a rainbow copy of $P$. We establish connection between the $La^*$ and the $La^*_R$ functions via poset rainbow forcing, determine the asymptotics of $La_R^*(n,T)$ for all tree posets and obtain further exact or asymptotic results for antichains and complete bipartite posets.</description>

      <title>Bounding signed bipartite partial t-trees and application to edge-coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a signed bipartite graph $(B, \pi)$ of negative girth $2k$, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for it to have the following property: each signed bipartite graph $(G, \sigma)$ whose negative girth is at least $2k$ and whose underlying graph has treewidth at most $t$ admits a homomorphism to $(B, \pi)$.
  Applying the result on the signed projective cube $SPC(2k-1)$, we conclude that every signed bipartite graph of negative girth at least $2k$ whose underlying graph is a partial 3-tree admits a homomorphism to $SPC(2k-1)$. For planar partial 3-trees, applying duality we conclude that if $G$ is a planar $2k$-regular multigraph whose dual has treewidth at most 3 and such that every edge-cut $(X, V\backslash X)$, where $|X|$ is odd, has size at least $2k$, then $G$ is $2k$-edge-colorable. This supports a conjecture of Seymour which, in full generality, largely extends Tait's reformulation of the four-color theorem, claiming that the fractional edge-chromatic number of a planar multigraph determines its edge-chromatic number.
  Finally, noting the contrast between fractional isomorphism and quantum isomorphism, where the former admits a polynomial time algorithm while the latter is proved to be undecidable, and observing the similarities of these notions to the subject of our study, we ask if there is an algorithm to decide if an input signed graph $\widehat{B}$ has the following property: if a signed planar graph $\widehat{G}$ does not map to $\widehat{B}$, it would be because a cycle in $\widehat{G}$ does not map to $\widehat{B}$. In other words, minimal planar graphs that do not map to $\widehat{B}$ are signed cycles.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Approach to Depoissonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate depoissonization, the problem of recovering asymptotics of sequence coefficients from their exponential generating function. Classical approaches rely on complex-analytic growth conditions, but here we develop real-variable methods that avoid such assumptions. We also address the inverse problem, deriving asymptotic expansions of the generating function itself in terms of its coefficients, thereby extending Ramanujan's original expansion. Taken together, these results offer a unified and elementary framework for depoissonization and its reverse, with applications to analytic combinatorics and probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider $\mathcal{L}\mathcal{R}$-ending partisan rulesets as a branch of combinatorial game theory. In these rulesets, the sets of options of both players are the same. However, there are two kinds of terminal positions. If the game ends in one of the terminal positions, then a player wins and if the game ends in the other terminal position, the other player wins. We introduce notations for positions in $\mathcal{L}\mathcal{R}$-ending partisan rulesets and show their algebraic structures. We also introduce some examples of $\mathcal{L}\mathcal{R}$-partisan rulesets and show how our results can be used for analyzing the rulesets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-strongly regular graphs form a significant generalization of strongly regular graphs. We study the eigenvalues of a family of such graphs, $\Gamma_H(G)$, constructed from a finite group $G$ and a subgroup $H$. Our main results include a sufficient condition for $\Gamma_H(G)$ to be integral and an explicit computation of its entire spectrum when $H$ is normal, revealing that the spectrum in this case depends only on $|G|$ and the index $[G:H]$.</description>

      <title>Optimal chromatic bound for ($P_2\cup P_4$, HVN)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HVN is a graph formed by removing two edges incident to the same vertex from the complete graph $K_5$. In this paper, we prove that every ($P_2\cup P_4$, HVN)-free graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G)\leq\lceil\frac{4}{3}\omega(G)\rceil$ when $\omega(G)\ge4$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$, respectively. Furthermore, this bound is optimal for every $\omega(G)\ge4$. Constructions demonstrating the optimality of the bound are provided. Our work unifies several previously known results on $\chi$-binding functions for several graph classes.</description>

      <title>Graph Irregularity via Edge Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pursue the study of edge-irregulators of graphs, which were recently introduced in [Fioravantes et al. Parametrised Distance to Local Irregularity. IPEC, 2024]. That is, we are interested in the parameter Ie(G), which, for a given graph G, denotes the smallest k &gt;= 0 such that G can be made locally irregular (i.e., with no two adjacent vertices having the same degree) by deleting k edges. We exhibit notable properties of interest of the parameter Ie, in general and for particular classes of graphs, together with parameterized algorithms for several natural graph parameters.
  Despite the computational hardness previously exhibited by this problem (NP-hard, W[1]-hard w.r.t. feedback vertex number, W[1]-hard w.r.t. solution size), we present two FPT algorithms, the first w.r.t. the solution size plus Delta and the second w.r.t. the vertex cover number of the input graph.
  Finally, we take important steps towards better understanding the behaviour of this problem in dense graphs. This is crucial when considering some of the parameters whose behaviour is still uncharted in regards to this problem (e.g., neighbourhood diversity, distance to clique). In particular, we identify a subfamily of complete graphs for which we are able to provide the exact value of Ie(G). These investigations lead us to propose a conjecture that Ie(G) should always be at most m/3 + c, where $m$ is the number of edges of the graph $G$ and $c$ is some constant. This conjecture is verified for various families of graphs, including trees.</description>

      <title>A note on embracing exchange sequences in oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open problem in convex geometry asks whether two simplices $A,B\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, both containing the origin in their convex hulls, admit a polynomial-length sequence of vertex exchanges transforming $A$ into $B$ while maintaining the origin in the convex hull throughout. We propose a matroidal generalization of the problem to oriented matroids, concerning exchange sequences between bases under sign constraints on elements appearing in certain fundamental circuits. We formulate a conjecture on the minimum length of such a sequence, and prove it for oriented graphic matroids of directed graphs. We also study connections between our conjecture and several long-standing open problems on exchange sequences between pairs of bases in unoriented matroids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_k(n)$ denote the set of $k$-distinct partitions of $n$, and let $B_k(n)$ be the set of $k$-regular partitions of $n$. Glaisher showed that $\# A_k(n) = \# B_k(n)$. For $k=2$, this equality yields the celebrated Euler's partition theorem. In this paper, we present a new partition set $E_k(n)$, which is equinumerous to $B_k(n)$.</description>

      <title>Balanced Stick Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an infinite sequence $(x_k)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ on the unit circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. We may interpret the first $n$ elements $(x_k)_{k=1}^{n}$ as places where the `circular stick' $\mathbb{S}^1$ is broken into a total of $n+1$ pieces. It is clear that they cannot all be the same length all the time. de Bruijn and Erd\H{o}s (1949) show that the ratio of the largest to the smallest has to be arbitrarily close to 2 infinitely many times which is sharp. They also consider the problem of balancing the length of $r$ consecutive intervals and prove $$ \frac{\max \mbox{length of}~r~\mbox{consecutive intervals}}{\min \mbox{length of}~r~\mbox{consecutive intervals}} \geq 1 + \frac{1}{r}.$$ We prove that this ratio can be as small as $1 + c \log{r}/ r$. This is done by means of refined discrepancy estimates for the van der Corput sequence over very short intervals and proves a conjecture of Brethouwer.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study approximate Hadamard matrices, that is, well-conditioned $n\times n$ matrices with all entries in $\{\pm1\}$. We show that the smallest-possible condition number goes to $1$ as $n\to\infty$, and we identify some explicit infinite families of approximate Hadamard matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof of the sufficiency of Rado's condition for the partition regularity of linear Diophantine equations that avoids any use of van der Waerden's theorem. The proof is based on fundamental properties that are common knowledge in combinatorics of numbers and is entirely elementary, with the sole exception of a standard application of the compactness principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rank-2 cluster scattering diagrams through moduli spaces of quiver representations and a recently developed combinatorial framework of tight gradings. Combining quiver-theoretic and combinatorial methods, we prove and extend a collection of conjectures posed by Elgin--Reading--Stella concerning the structural and enumerative properties of the wall-function coefficients. The tight grading perspective also provides a new proof of the Weyl group symmetry of the scattering diagram.</description>

      <title>Different Forms of Imbalance in Strongly Playable Discrete Games II: Multi-Player RPS Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classic Rock-Paper-Scissors, RPS, has seen many variants and generalizations in the past several years. In the previous paper, we defined playability and balance for games. We used these definitions to show that different forms of imbalance agree on the most balanced and least balanced form of playable two-player n-object RPS games, referred to as (2,n)-RPS. We reintroduce these definitions here and show that, given a conjecture, the generalization of this game for m&lt;50 players is a strongly playable RPS game. We also show that this game maximizes these forms of imbalance in the limit as the number of players goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study variants of weight enumerators of linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We generalize the concept of average complete joint weight enumerators of two linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also give its MacWilliams type identities. Then we establish a monomial analogue of Yoshida's theorem for this average complete joint weight enumerators. Finally, we present the generalized representation for average of $g$-fold complete joint weight enumerators for $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear codes and establish a monomial matrix analogue of Yoshida's theorem for average $g$-fold complete joint weight enumerators.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we give group-theoretical conditions on the maximal parabolic subgroups of a coset geometry for it to be a chiral hypertope, bypassing the need to construct the incidence graph of the coset geometry to determine whether or not it is a chiral hypertope. This result permits to study much larger coset geometries with computers and gives hope on proving theoretical results about coset geometries that are chiral hypertopes.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the number of integer pairs summing to powers of 2 via graph labeling and solving restricted systems of linear (in)equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of finding sets of integers of a given size with a maximum number of pairs summing to powers of $2$. By fixing particular pairs, this problem reduces to finding a labeling of the vertices of a given graph with pairwise distinct integers such that the endpoint labels for each edge sum up to a power of $2$. We propose an efficient algorithm for this problem, which at its core relies on another algorithm that, given two sets of linear homogeneous polynomials with integer coefficients, computes all variable assignments to powers of $2$ that nullify polynomials from the first set but not from the second. With the proposed algorithms, we determine the maximum size of graphs of order $n$ that admit such a labeling for all $n\leq 21$, and construct the maximum admissible graphs for $n\leq 20$. We also identify the minimal forbidden subgraphs of order $\leq 11$, whose presence prevents the graphs from having such a labeling.</description>

      <title>Unbounded matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matroid base polytope is a polytope in which each vertex has 0,1 coordinates and each edge is parallel to a difference of two coordinate vectors. Matroid base polytopes are described combinatorially by integral submodular functions on a boolean lattice, satisfying the unit increase property. We define a more general class of unbounded matroids, or U-matroids, by replacing the boolean lattice with an arbitrary distributive lattice. U-matroids thus serve as a combinatorial model for polyhedra that satisfy the vertex and edge conditions of matroid base polytopes, but may be unbounded. Like polymatroids, U-matroids generalize matroids and arise as a special case of submodular systems. We prove that every U-matroid admits a canonical largest extension to a matroid, which we call the generous extension; the analogous geometric statement is that every U-matroid base polyhedron contains a unique largest matroid base polytope. We show that the supports of vertices of a U-matroid base polyhedron span a shellable simplicial complex, and we characterize U-matroid basis systems in terms of shelling orders, generalizing Bj\"orner's and Gale's criteria for a simplicial complex to be a matroid independence complex. Finally, we present an application of our theory to subspace arrangements and show that the generous extension has a natural geometric interpretation in this setting.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there is a function $f$ such that every graph with no $K$-fat $K_4$ minor is $f(K)$-quasi-isometric to a graph with no $K_4$ minor. This solves the $K_4$-case of a general conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu. Our proof technique also yields a new short proof of the respective $K_4^-$-case, which was first established by Fujiwara and Papasoglu.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees of claw-free graphs with few leaves and branch vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tree. A vertex of degree one is a \emph{leaf} of $T$ and a vertex of degree at least three is a \emph{branch vertex} of $T$. A graph is said to be claw-free if it does not contain $K_{1,3}$ as an induced subgraph. In this paper, we study the spanning trees with a bounded number of leaves and branch vertices of claw-free graphs. Applying the main results, we also give some improvements of previous results on the spanning trees with few branch vertices for the case of claw-free graphs.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Reiner--Saliola--Welker's well-known but mysterious family of *$k$-random-to-random shuffles* from Markov chains on symmetric groups to Markov chains on the Type-$A$ Iwahori--Hecke algebras. We prove that the family of operators pairwise commutes and has eigenvalues that are polynomials in $q$ with non-negative integer coefficients. Our work generalizes work of Reiner--Saliola--Welker and Lafreni\`ere for the symmetric group, and simplifies all known proofs in this case.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron Conjecture in the $\ell_2$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Tetrahedron Conjecture of Tur\'an from the 1940s asserts that the number of edges in an $n$-vertex $3$-graph without the tetrahedron, the complete $3$-graph on four vertices, cannot exceed that of the balanced complete cyclic $3$-partite $3$-graph, whose edges are of types $V_1 V_2 V_3$, $V_1 V_1 V_2$, $V_2 V_2 V_3$, and $V_3 V_3 V_1$. A recent surprising result of Balogh-Clemen-Lidick\'y [J. Lond. Math. Soc. (2) 106 (2022)] shows that this conjecture is asymptotically true in the $\ell_2$-norm, where the number of edges is replaced by the sum of squared codegrees. They further conjectured that, in this $\ell_2$-norm setting, the $3$-partite construction is uniquely extremal for large $n$. We confirm this conjecture.
  Two key ingredients in our proofs include establishing a Mantel theorem for vertex-colored graphs that forbid certain types of triangles, and introducing a novel procedure integrated into Simonovits' stability method, which essentially reduces the task to verifying that the $\ell_2$-norm of certain near-extremal constructions increases under suitable local modifications. The strategy in the latter may be of independent interest and potentially applicable to other extremal problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a non-negative integer $d$ let $\alpha_d(G)$ be the order of a largest induced $d$-degenerate subgraph of $G$. We prove that for any pair of non-negative integers $k&gt;d$, if $G$ is a $k$-degenerate graph, then $\alpha_d(G) \geq \max\{ \frac{(d+1)n}{k+d+1}, n - \alpha_{k-d-1}(G)\}$. For $k$-degenerate graphs this improves a more general lower bound of Alon, Kahn, and Seymour. By modifying our argument we obtain improved lower bound on $\alpha_d(G)$ for graphs of bounded genus. This extends earlier work on degenerate subgraphs of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Finest positroid subdivisions from maximal weakly separated collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adopt a formal and algebraic approach of Early \cite{E2} to study the positive tropical Grassmannian $\operatorname{Trop}^+ Gr_{k,n}$. Specifically, we deal with positroid subdivision of hypersimplex induced by translated blades from any maximal weakly separated collection. One of our main results gives a necessary and sufficient condition on a maximal weakly separated collection to form a positroid subdivision of a hypersimplex corresponding to a simplicial cone in $\rm Trop^+Gr_{k,n}$. For k = 2 our condition says that any weakly separated collection of two-elements sets gives such a simplicial cone, and all cones are of such a form. We also show that the maximality of any weakly separated collection is preserved under the boundary map, which armatively answers a question by Early in \cite{E1}. Plabic graphs, invented by Postnikov \cite{P}, are of use in proving this result. As a corollary, we get that all those positroid subdivisions are the finest. Thus, the flip of two maximal weakly separatedcollections corresponds to a pair of adjacent maximal cones in positive tropical Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>The random $k$-SAT Gibbs uniqueness threshold revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any $k\geq3$ for clause/variable ratios up to the Gibbs uniqueness threshold of the corresponding Galton-Watson tree, the number of satisfying assignments of random $k$-SAT formulas is given by the `replica symmetric solution' predicted by physics methods [Monasson, Zecchina: Phys. Rev. Lett. (1996)]. Furthermore, while the Gibbs uniqueness threshold is still not known precisely for any $k\geq3$, we derive new lower bounds on this threshold that improve over prior work [Montanari and Shah: SODA (2007)].The improvement is significant particularly for small $k$.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Ramanujan's formula for sums of half-integer powers of consecutive integers via formal Bernoulli series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Faulhaber's formula expresses the sum of the first $n$ positive integers, each raised to an integer power $p\geq 0$, as a polynomial in $n$ of degree $p+1$. Ramanujan expressed this sum for $p\in\{\frac12,\frac32,\frac52,\frac72\}$ as the sum of a polynomial in $\sqrt{n}$ and a certain infinite series. In the present work, we explore the connection to Bernoulli polynomials, and by generalizing those to formal series, we extend the Ramanujan result to all positive half-integers $p$.</description>

      <title>A strengthened bound on the number of states required to characterize maximum parsimony distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the distance $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ between two unrooted binary phylogenetic trees $T_1, T_2$ on the same set of taxa can be defined by a character that is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$ and which has at most $2k$ states. This significantly improves upon the previous bound of $7k-5$ states. We also show that for every $k \geq 1$ there exist two trees $T_1, T_2$ with $d_{\mathrm{MP}}(T_1,T_2) = k$ such that at least $k+1$ states are necessary in any character that achieves this distance and which is convex on one of $T_1, T_2$. We augment these lower and upper bounds with an empirical analysis which shows that in practice significantly fewer than $k+1$ states are usually required.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Tree Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an $n$-point metric space $(X,d_X)$, a tree cover $\mathcal{T}$ is a set of $|\mathcal{T}|=k$ trees on $X$ such that every pair of vertices in $X$ has a low-distortion path in one of the trees in $\mathcal{T}$. Tree covers have been playing a crucial role in graph algorithms for decades, and the research focus is the construction of tree covers with small size $k$ and distortion.
  When $k=1$, the best distortion is known to be $\Theta(n)$. For a constant $k\ge 2$, the best distortion upper bound is $\tilde O(n^{\frac 1 k})$ and the strongest lower bound is $\Omega(\log_k n)$, leaving a gap to be closed. In this paper, we improve the lower bound to $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}})$.
  Our proof is a novel analysis on a structurally simple grid-like graph, which utilizes some combinatorial fixed-point theorems. We believe that they will prove useful for analyzing other tree-like data structures as well.</description>

      <title>Balanced Fibonacci word rectangles, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25994v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton. We also generalize the result to every Sturmian characteristic word corresponding to a quadratic irrational. Finally, we also examine the analogous question for the Tribonacci word and the Thue-Morse word.</description>

      <title>Ergodic averages for sparse corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the study of the limiting behavior of multiple ergodic averages with commuting transformations when all iterates are given by the same sparse sequence; this enables us to partially resolve several longstanding problems. First, we address a special case of the joint intersectivity question of Bergelson, Leibman, and Lesigne by giving necessary and sufficient conditions under which the multidimensional polynomial Szemer\'edi theorem holds for length-three patterns. Second, we show that for two commuting transformations, the Furstenberg averages remain unchanged when the iterates are taken along sparse sequences such as $[n^c]$ for a positive noninteger $c$, advancing a conjecture of the first author. Third, we extend a result of Chu on popular common differences in linear corners to polynomial and Hardy corners. Lastly, we answer open problems of Le, Moreira, and Richter concerning decomposition results for double correlation sequences. Our toolbox includes recent degree lowering and seminorm smoothing techniques, the machinery of magic extensions of Host, and novel structured extensions motivated by works of Tao and Leng. Combined, these techniques reduce the analysis to settings where the Host-Kra theory of characteristic factors and equidistribution on nilmanifolds yield a family of striking identities from which our main results follow.</description>

      <title>Tropicalization and cluster asymptotic phenomenon of generalized Markov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>$t$-Young complexes and squarefree powers of $t$-path ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of simplicial complexes, called \emph{$t$-Young complexes}, arising from a Young diagram and a positive integer~$t$. We show that every $t$-Young complex is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. A complete characterization of their vertex-decomposability is provided, and in several cases, we establish explicit formulas for their homotopy types. Interestingly, $t$-Young complexes naturally appear as the Alexander dual complexes of squarefree powers of $t$-path ideals of path graphs, as well as of certain ideals generated by subsets of their minimal generators. As an application, we derive formulas for the projective dimension and Krull dimension of these squarefree powers.</description>
