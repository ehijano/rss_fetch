      <title>Progress in Decompositional Electromagnetic Analysis of Digital Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of PCB and packaging interconnect design, electromagnetic analysis tools have transitioned from optional to essential over the last two decades, as data rates soared beyond 6 Gbps. Today, with standard data rates eclipsing 6 Gbps and reaching thresholds of 224 Gbps, these tools are indispensable for designing reliable interconnects. The goals of the interconnect analysis are simple: identify interconnects that may fail at the target data rate and allow troubleshooting and fixing the problem. The most efficient approach to such pass-fail analysis is the Decompositional Electromagnetic Analysis (DEA). It allows separation of the signal degradation factors for faster analysis and troubleshooting. This paper outlines the basic elements of DEA, discusses conditions for its accuracy and underscores its significance in the future of interconnect design.</description>

      <title>Charge management system based on disturbance observer sliding mode control for space inertial sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision space inertial sensors are imperative for Earth geodesy missions, gravitational wave observations, and fundamental physics experiments in space. In these missions, free-falling test masses(TMs) are susceptible to parasitic electrostatic forces and torques, with significant contributions from the interaction between stray electric fields and TM charge. These effects can make up a sizable fraction of the noise budget. Thus, a charge management system(CMS) is essential in high-precise space-based missions. However, the operating environment for space charge control is full of uncertainties and disturbances. TM charge tracking precision is negatively affected by many physical parameters such as external charging rate, quantum yield, UV light power, etc. Those parameters are rarely measured and supposed to vary because of changes in solar activity, temperature, aging of electronic components and so on. The unpredictability and variability of these parameters affects the CMS performance in long-term space missions and must be evaluated or eliminated. This paper presents a simple physics-based model of the discharging process with high charging/discharging rate based on the geometry of inertial sensors. After that, a disturbance observer sliding mode control (DOSMC) is proposed for the CMS with parametric uncertainties and unknown disturbance to maintain the TM charge below a certain level and improve its robustness. The simulation results show that the DOSMC is able to force the system trajectory coincides with the sliding line, which depends neither on the parameters or disturbances. In this way, the DOSMC can effectively ignore the parameter perturbation and external disturbances. The control precision can reach 0.1 mV, which is superior to that of a classic proportional-integral-derivative controller and conventional sliding mode control.</description>

      <title>Low two-level-system noise in hydrogenated amorphous silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At sub-Kelvin temperatures, two-level systems (TLS) present in amorphous dielectrics source a permittivity noise, degrading the performance of a wide range of devices using superconductive resonators such as qubits or kinetic inductance detectors. We report here on measurements of TLS noise in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) in superconductive lumped-element resonators using parallel-plate capacitors (PPCs). The TLS noise results presented in this article for two recipes of a-Si:H improve on the best achieved in the literature by a factor &gt;5 for a-Si:H and other amorphous dielectrics and are comparable to those observed for resonators deposited on crystalline dielectrics.</description>

      <title>PCB Transducer Coil Design for a Low-Noise Magnetic Measurement System in Space Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here a minimum power dissipation coil transducer has been designed to allow in-flight noise characterization of a low-frequency magnetic measurement system. The coil was produced using PCB technology to provide mechanical stability and easy integration close to the magnetic sensors. The transducer design strategy relies on an inverse boundary element method, which has been efficiently adapted to produce optimal multilayer PCB coils subjected to different geometrical and performance constraints. The resulting coil transducer was simulated and experimentally validated under realistic conditions where the payload is magnetically shielded from low-frequency fluctuations by using a three-layer cylindrical mu-metal enclosure. The results show that the specific transducer coil proposed efficiently produces stable magnetic conditions for adequate validation of the magnetic diagnostic system while providing reduced power dissipation and optimal mechanical stability.</description>

      <title>Beam test results of a fully 3D-printed plastic scintillator particle detector prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic scintillators are widely used for the detection of elementary particles, and 3D reconstruction of particle tracks is achieved by segmenting the detector into 3D granular structures. In this study, we present a novel prototype fabricated by additive manufacturing, consisting of a 5 x 5 x 5 array of 1 cm3 plastic scintillator cubes, each optically isolated. This innovative approach eliminates the need to construct complex monolithic geometries in a single operation and gets rid of the traditional time-consuming manufacturing and assembling processes. The prototype underwent performance characterization during a beam test at CERN's Proton-Synchrotron facility. Light yield, optical crosstalk, and light response uniformity, were evaluated. The prototype demonstrated a consistent light yield of approximately 27 photoelectrons (p.e.) per channel, similar to traditional cast scintillator detectors. Crosstalk between adjacent cubes averaged 4-5%, and light yield uniformity within individual cubes exhibited about 7% variation, indicating stability and reproducibility. These results underscore the potential of the novel additive manufacturing technique, for efficient and reliable production of high-granularity scintillator detectors.</description>

      <title>Physics Instrument Design with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a case for the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the design of physics instrument as an alternative to gradient-based instrument-optimization methods. It's applicability is demonstrated using two empirical studies. One is longitudinal segmentation of calorimeters and the second is both transverse segmentation as well longitudinal placement of trackers in a spectrometer. Based on these experiments, we propose an alternative approach that offers unique advantages over differentiable programming and surrogate-based differentiable design optimization methods. First, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms possess inherent exploratory capabilities, which help mitigate the risk of convergence to local optima. Second, this approach eliminates the necessity of constraining the design to a predefined detector model with fixed parameters. Instead, it allows for the flexible placement of a variable number of detector components and facilitates discrete decision-making. We then discuss the road map of how this idea can be extended into designing very complex instruments. The presented study sets the stage for a novel framework in physics instrument design, offering a scalable and efficient framework that can be pivotal for future projects such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC), where most optimized detectors are essential for exploring physics at unprecedented energy scales.</description>

      <title>A Composite Target of a Radium Salt and a Soft Metal Matrix for Production of Ac-225 with a Proton or Electron Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of 225Ac using either a proton or electron accelerator requires a target of 226Ra. Radium metal is difficult to work with and so a radium salt, such as radium carbonate, is preferred as a target material. Normally available as a powder, the average density of the powder is low and the thermal conductivity is poor, thus limiting the beam power that can be dissipated in the target. This work proposes the creation of a solid mixture of a radium salt powder with a metal matrix. Although aluminum powder has been used in similar applications, we suggest that indium powder is good choice for the metal matrix in the case of radioactive radium salts. The target can be formed with low die pressure without any need for heating, thus simplifying the hot-cell equipment needed for target preparation. We describe how the solid mixture can be formed, measure its thermal conductivity and compare the value to model estimates. We calculate the yield of 225Ac under different scenarios. Calculations show that the radioactive isotopes of indium produced during the irradiation should not produce significant handling challenges post-irradiation. For the proposed target geometry and beam parameters, thermal modelling indicates that the target temperature will be below the melting point of indium and the heat flux from the surfaces will be manageable. Thermal resistance at the target interfaces is shown to have a large effect on the target temperature. Using indium powder to form the mixture, occupying about 40 % of the target volume, we find that the yield of 225Ac is 80 GBq (2 Ci) for a 10-day irradiation with a 24 MeV, 3 kW proton beam and approximately the same for three milkings of 225Ra after a 10-day irradiation with a 25 MeV, 20 kW electron beam.</description>

      <title>Large-format photodetecting system pCam6060 with a GSENSE6060BSI CMOS detector, developed at SAO RAS and optimized for photometric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pCam6060 photodetecting system was developed at SAO RAS and is based on the GSENSE6060BSI photodetector manufactured by GPixel (China) with a frame format of 6144x6144 active pixels and a pixel size of 10 mkm. The readout speed reached 11 fps. The back-illuminated detector has a wide spectral range of 200-1040 nm with a minimum quantum efficiency (QE) of 10% and maximum sensitivity of 95% at 580 nm. The quantum efficiency in the near-infrared range was 58% at 850 nm. The pCam6060 system controller implements a mode of simultaneous image readout via two 12-bit video channels with different gain and their subsequent combination in the controller into a single frame with an extended 16-bit dynamic range. This method simultaneously achieves a low readout noise level (about 3 e-) in the high-gain channel and a large dynamic range (full well capacity of about 100000 e-) in the low-gain channel. Back-illuminated CMOS detectors, unlike front-illuminated devices, do not have the effect of long-term preserving the residual charge from previous exposures, which makes them suitable for recording faint objects in photometric long-exposure observation methods. Communication between the host computer and the camera was carried out via a fiber optic line at distances of up to 50 m. Video data are recorded on the computer hard drive in real-time. The pCam6060 photodetecting system is designed for astronomical applications and has a moisture-proof design.</description>

      <title>Signal and Power transmission over Fiber in the DUNE Far Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the far detectors of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be instrumented with a Vertical Drift Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (VD LArTPC). It will also be equipped with a Photo-Detection System (PDS), which determines the time of interaction of non-beam events, as well as contributing to the energy reconstruction. The characteristics of this new type of LArTPC required an innovative approach to the placement of the photo-detectors. In order to achieve a high light yield and uniform coverage of the detector, the PDS detectors in the VD LArTPC will be placed not only on the membrane walls of the cryostat, but also on the high voltage surface of the TPC's cathode. Such placement enhances the coverage of the PDS but presents an important technical challenge, since the powering and signal readout of the detectors must be done using non-conducting materials. To this end the Power-over-Fiber and Signal-over-Fiber transmission technologies were developed within the DUNE collaboration, opening a door to further enhance the coverage of future PD systems. This document will describe the technical solutions developed to this end, as well as presenting the final performance results from laboratory characterization of the devices and the prototype testing campaigns carried out at the CERN Neutrino Platform.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High Energy Physics (HEP) data acquisition systems are often built from high-end FPGAs. As such systems scale in the HL-LHC era, severe under-utilization of FPGA transceivers can occur because front-end links prioritize radiation hardness and power consumption over raw data bandwidth. This work evaluates recently introduced low-power, low-cost FPGA devices as an alternative building block for future readout architectures. This study presents the implementation of a readout back-End on FPGA where the front-end protocol is based on the Low-Power GigaBit Transceiver (lpGBT) and the readout protocol is based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet, using the LHCb Run 4 RICH detector as a practical case study.</description>

      <title>OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded, Refined, and Overhauled Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.</description>

      <title>Identification of highly-forbidden optical transitions in highly charged ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical clocks represent the most precise experimental devices, finding application in fields spanning from frequency metrology to fundamental physics. Recently, the first highly charged ions (HCI) based optical clock was demonstrated using Ar$^{13+}$, opening up a plethora of novel systems with advantageous atomic properties for high accuracy clocks. While numerous candidate systems have been explored theoretically, the considerable uncertainty of the clock transition frequency for most species poses experimental challenges. Here, we close this gap by exploring quantum logic-inspired experimental search techniques for sub-Hertz clock transitions in HCI confined to a linear Paul trap. These techniques encompass Rabi excitation, an optical dipole force (ODF) approach, and linear continuous sweeping (LCS) and their applicability for different types of HCI. Through our investigation, we provide tools to pave the way for the development of exceptionally precise HCI-based optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>

Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Modification on thermal motion in Geant4 for neutron capture simulation in Gadolinium loaded water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron tagging is a fundamental technique for electron anti-neutrino detection via the inverse beta decay channel. A reported discrepancy in neutron detection efficiency between observational data and simulation predictions prompted an investigation into neutron capture modeling in Geant4. The study revealed that an overestimation of the thermal motion of hydrogen atoms in Geant4 impacts the fraction of captured nuclei. By manually modifying the Geant4 implementation, the simulation results align with calculations based on evaluated nuclear data and show good agreement with observables derived from the SK-Gd data.</description>

      <title>Molten salt ion source using glass capillaries as emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a proof of concept of an ion source using a molten salt mixture to produce a beam of desired alkali ions like Cs$^+$ when polarized positively or oxygen complexes like NO$_3^-$ when polarized negatively. Similar to liquid metal ion sources, the ions of the salt are emitted by field evaporation from a Taylor cone formed under the influence of an intense electric field, but unlike liquid metal sources, the meniscus of the Taylor cone is not anchored on the tip of a tungsten needle but rather on the tip of a conical glass capillary containing the molten salt. We succeeded in producing a stable ion beam emission of several $\mu$A for about 50 min. We also discuss the behavior of the molten salt mixture in vacuum conditions, as to our knowledge, molten salts in vacuum conditions are not well documented in the literature, while their properties are essential to the design of the presented ion source.</description>
