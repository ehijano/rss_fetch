      <title>Droplet at the Corner of a V-Shaped Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in the physics of droplet--fiber interactions is: What is the maximum droplet volume a fiber can retain? While this problem has been studied for horizontal fibers and at the apex $\Lambda$-shaped bent fibers, it remains less explored for V-shaped bent fibers, despite their demonstrated advantages in engineering applications such as fog harvesting. This work investigates the capability of V-shaped fibers in retaining droplets against gravity. An analytical model to predict the maximum droplet volume on V-shaped fibers is developed based on free energy analysis, and validated against experimental data from five liquid--fiber pairs. The dependence of the maximum droplet volume on $\alpha$ can be reasonably captured by the function $\cos\beta/\cos\left(\beta-\alpha/2\right)$, where $\beta$ denotes the droplet's off-axis angle. As $\alpha$ increases from $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$, the maximum droplet volume slightly decreases before entering a broad transition region around $\alpha \approx 40^\circ$--$100^\circ$, and then increases at larger $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization for trailing-edge noise reduction using large-eddy simulation and ensemble-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the trailing-edge shape of an airfoil is optimized to reduce the acoustic noise based on large-eddy simulation (LES). It is achieved by the ensemble Kalman method, which can enhance the optimization efficiency by using the gradient of cost function approximated with sample covariances. Moreover, the update scheme is reformulated to impose smoothness regularization and enable simultaneous reduction in the trailing edge noise and the drag-to-lift ratio. The trailing edge is optimized with a reduced bevel angle based on the ensemble Kalman method. The flow field near the optimal trailing edge shows that the flow separation and vortex shedding are suppressed compared to the baseline shape, indicating a significant decrease in the drag-to-lift ratio and noise generation. Also, the spectral proper orthogonal decomposition method is used to analyze the flow structure around the trailing edge, identifying that the optimal shape achieves acoustic noise reduction by disrupting large-scale flow structures. Further, the spectrum of Lighthill stress reveals that the optimal trailing edge suppresses the high-frequency noise through the nonlinear interaction of reduced low-frequency velocity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Surfing on chemical waves: a simple yet dynamically rich two-sphere responsive gel swimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-oscillating gels are chemically-responsive hydrogels coupled to an oscillating chemical reaction of a stimulus solute. In response to the oscillating solute concentration field, responsive gels periodically swell and deswell, expelling their adsorbed water as they transition to a drier state, and reswelling once they return to a hydrophilic state. This volume phase transition occurs when the local stimulus concentration crosses a critical value, about which the hydrophilicity of the polymer chains changes abruptly. These gels have been used to make surface crawlers or other pulsatile machines, but here we show that a very simple system comprising two oscillating gel spheres linked by a rigid rod can also swim in the inertialess Stokes regime - albeit rather slowly. Developing a full continuum-mechanical model for a gel that employs a reaction described by the Brusselator model to generate oscillating chemical concentrations that couple to gel and fluid dynamics, we quantify the rate of shrinkage and swelling and associated flows as the gels pump out or draw in water. Herein, we derive analytical results for the swimming velocity of these swimmers, and upon placing them in a solute bath, identify two modes of behaviour upon encountering propagating reaction-diffusion waves: 'bobbing' and 'surfing'. Though somewhat slower than flagellated swimmers, the relative simplicity of the system, with no hinges or moving components, lends itself well to large scale production.</description>

      <title>Entropy-patch choked-nozzle interaction: quasi-steady and inertial modeling regimes mapped and limits of linearization established</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of entropy-patch shape, size, and strength on the upstream acoustic response generated by entropy-patch choked-nozzle interactions are investigated. Numerical-simulation-based investigations, using a two-dimensional planar Euler code, reveal the existence of two distinct modeling regimes: the quasi-steady (matching-condition) regime and the inertial regime, respectively. The ratio of the entropy-patch streamwise length scale to the nozzle throat height was found to be an order parameter, which allows one to determine which of the two modeling regimes applies. Indeed, for entropy patches with a streamwise length scale smaller or equal to the nozzle throat height, the inertial model provides a satisfactory prediction of the upstream acoustic response. For entropy patches with a streamwise length scale larger than the nozzle throat height, the matching condition model has superior predictive accuracy. The entropy patch's shape was judged to have only a slight impact on the applicable modeling regime. Additionally, the study examined entropy-patch strength using the ratio of area-specific perturbation energy to area-specific upstream energy as an order parameter, establishing that both above-mentioned linear models are only valid for weak entropy patches. These findings provide a framework for selecting appropriate models for entropy-patch choked-nozzle interaction scenarios, furthering the fundamental understanding of indirect noise-driven combustion instability.</description>

      <title>Flow-driven hysteresis in the transition boiling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition boiling is an intermediate regime occurring between nucleate boiling, where bubbles at the surface efficiently carry heat away, and film boiling, where a layer of vapor formed over the surface insulates the system reducing heat transfer. This regime is inherently unstable and typically occurs near the boiling crisis, where the system approaches the maximum heat flux. Transition boiling hysteresis remains a central open problem in phase-change heat transfer, with critical implications for industrial cooling systems and nuclear reactor safety, since entering this regime sharply reduces heat removal potentially leading to overheating or component damage. We investigate the mechanisms driving hysteresis in the transition boiling regime through large-scale three-dimensional numerical simulations, providing clearcut evidence that hysteresis occurs even under idealized conditions of pool boiling on flat surfaces at constant temperature. This demonstrates that hysteresis arises purely from the flow dynamics of the liquid-vapor system, rather than from surface properties or defects. Moreover, we disclose strong asymmetries in the transition dynamics between nucleate and film boiling. During heating, the transition is abrupt and memory-less, whereas, upon decreasing the surface temperature, it is more complex, with the emergence of metastable coexisting states that can delay the transition.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric counterflow turbulence in open geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report preliminary results on spherical thermal counterflow generated by a small central heater in an open geometry, an open bath of superfluid He~II, as closed-cell experiments could have introduced artifacts such as overheating and boundary-induced flows. In order to eliminate them, we measure second sound attenuation in a plane-parallel resonator. Our results are at variance with the previous experiments in closed spherical cavity that showed plateau in the steady-state vortex line density and its inverse time decay, neither of which is observed presently. We find that in open geometry the vortex line density $L$ increases steadily with counterflow velocity $v_\mathrm{ns}$, displaying a crossover between $L \propto v_\mathrm{ns}^2$ typical for counterflow and $L \propto v_\mathrm{ns}^{3/2}$, characteristic for the quasi-classical scaling.</description>

      <title>A proposal for automated turbulence modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) closed with an eddy viscosity computed through a turbulence model is still the leading approach for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations. Unfortunately, universal models with good predictive capabilities over a wide range of flows are not available.
  In this work, we propose the use of machine learning to improve existing RANS models. The approach does not require high-fidelity training data. A convolutional neural network is used to identify and segment at runtime the flow field into different zones, each resembling one item of a predefined list of elementary flows. The turbulence model applied in each zone is taken from an equally predefined set of classic models, each specifically tuned to work best for one elementary flow, free from the requirement of universality.
  The idea is first presented in general terms, and then demonstrated via a preliminary implementation, where only three elementary flows are considered, and three turbulence models are used. Test cases show that, already in this oversimplified form, automated zonal modelling outperforms the baseline RANS models without computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Pathways to Elastic Turbulence in Giant Micelles Through Curvature Ratios in Taylor-Couette Flow</title>

Abstract: In the past fifteen years, flow instabilities reminiscent of the Taylor-like instabilities driven by hoop stresses, have been observed in wormlike micelles based on surfactant molecules. In particular, purely elastic instabilities and turbulence have been shown to develop on top of shear banding, a type of flow specific to the semi-dilute and concentrated regimes. These instabilities have been identified as the origin of the large body of data showing complex spatio-temporal fluctuations, collected in shear-banded systems using multiple experimental techniques. Different categories of banding have been suggested depending on their stability, which involve intrinsic properties of the system and streamline curvature. It has been shown qualitatively that instabilities are promoted by an increase of the surfactant concentration or of the curvature of the flow geometry, while an increase in temperature stabilizes the flow. Here, using benchmark shear banding micellar systems, we quantify, for the first time, the effect of the streamline curvature on these flow instabilities, focusing more specifically on the transition towards purely elastic turbulence. Using various optical visualizations, we identify two transitional pathways to elastic turbulence. We construct a generic state diagram in a parameter space based on the curvature ratio and the Weissenberg number. The nature -- supercritical \textit{vs} subcritical -- of the transition to elastic turbulence is discussed. The stress evolution is in favor of a change of nature from subcritical to supercritical transition as the curvature ratio increases. However we show that finite size effects cannot be neglected and may smooth artificially the stress response. Furthermore, each domain of this diagram is characterized using velocimetry measurements. Finally a scaling for the onset of elastic turbulence is determined.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Unstable Singularities</title>

Abstract: Whether singularities can form in fluids remains a foundational unanswered question in mathematics. This phenomenon occurs when solutions to governing equations, such as the 3D Euler equations, develop infinite gradients from smooth initial conditions. Historically, numerical approaches have primarily identified stable singularities. However, these are not expected to exist for key open problems, such as the boundary-free Euler and Navier-Stokes cases, where unstable singularities are hypothesized to play a crucial role. Here, we present the first systematic discovery of new families of unstable singularities. A stable singularity is a robust outcome, forming even if the initial state is slightly perturbed. In contrast, unstable singularities are exceptionally elusive; they require initial conditions tuned with infinite precision, being in a state of instability whereby infinitesimal perturbations immediately divert the solution from its blow-up trajectory. In particular, we present multiple new, unstable self-similar solutions for the incompressible porous media equation and the 3D Euler equation with boundary, revealing a simple empirical asymptotic formula relating the blow-up rate to the order of instability. Our approach combines curated machine learning architectures and training schemes with a high-precision Gauss-Newton optimizer, achieving accuracies that significantly surpass previous work across all discovered solutions. For specific solutions, we reach near double-float machine precision, attaining a level of accuracy constrained only by the round-off errors of the GPU hardware. This level of precision meets the requirements for rigorous mathematical validation via computer-assisted proofs. This work provides a new playbook for exploring the complex landscape of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) and tackling long-standing challenges in mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic solutions for self-similarly expanding fault slip induced by fluid injection at constant rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the circular, self-similar expansion of frictional rupture due to fluid injected at a constant rate. Fluid migrates within a thin permeable layer parallel to and containing the fault plane. When the Poisson ratio $\nu=0$, self-similarity of the fluid pressure implies fault slip also evolves in an axisymmetric, self-similar manner, reducing the three-dimensional problem for the evolution of fault slip to a single self-similar dimension. The rupture radius grows as $\lambda \sqrt{4\alpha_{hy} t}$, where $t$ is time since the start of injection and $\alpha_{hy}$ is the hydraulic diffusivity of the pore fluid pressure. The prefactor $\lambda$ is determined by a single parameter, $T$, which depends on the pre-injection stress state and injection conditions. The prefactor has the range $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\infty$, the lower and upper limits of which correspond to marginal pressurization of the fault and critically stressed conditions, in which the fault-resolved shear stress is close to the pre-injection fault strength. In both limits, we derive solutions for slip by perturbation expansion, to arbitrary order. In the marginally pressurized limit ($\lambda\rightarrow 0$), the perturbation is regular and the series expansion is convergent. For the critically stressed limit ($\lambda\rightarrow \infty$), the perturbation is singular, contains a boundary layer and an outer solution, and the series is divergent. In this case, we provide a composite solution with uniform convergence over the entire rupture using a matched asymptotic expansion. We provide error estimates of the asymptotic expansions in both limits, and demonstrate optimal truncation of the singular perturbation in the critically stressed limit.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed, boundary-constrained Gaussian process regression for the reconstruction of fluid flow fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression techniques have been used in fluid mechanics for the reconstruction of flow fields from a reduction-of-dimension perspective. A main ingredient in this setting is the construction of adapted covariance functions, or kernels, to obtain such estimates. In this paper, we present a general method for constraining a prescribed Gaussian process on an arbitrary compact set. The kernel of the pre-defined process must be at least continuous and may include other information about the studied phenomenon. This general boundary-constraining framework can be implemented with high flexibility for a broad range of engineering applications. From this, we derive physics-informed kernels for simulating two-dimensional velocity fields of an incompressible (divergence-free) flow around aerodynamic profiles. These kernels allow to define Gaussian process priors satisfying the incompressibility condition and the prescribed boundary conditions along the profile in a continuous manner. We describe an adapted numerical method for the boundary-constraining procedure parameterized by a measure on the compact set. The relevance of the methodology and performances are illustrated by numerical simulations of flows around a cylinder and a NACA 0412 airfoil profile, for which no observation at the boundary is needed at all.</description>

      <title>Chemomechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the self-organized chemomechanical coupling resulting from the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemomechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures.</description>
