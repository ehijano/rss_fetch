      <title>Differentially Private Multi-objective Selection: Pareto and Aggregation Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially private selection mechanisms are fundamental building blocks for privacy-preserving data analysis. While numerous mechanisms exist for single-objective selection, many real-world applications require optimizing multiple competing objectives simultaneously. We present two novel mechanisms for differentially private multi-objective selection: PrivPareto and PrivAgg. PrivPareto uses a novel Pareto score to identify solutions near the Pareto frontier, while PrivAgg enables privacy-preserving weighted aggregation of multiple objectives. Both mechanisms support global and local sensitivity approaches, with comprehensive theoretical analysis showing how to compose sensitivities of multiple utility functions. We demonstrate the practical applicability through two real-world applications: cost-sensitive decision tree construction and multi-objective influential node selection in social networks. The experimental results showed that our local sensitivity-based approaches achieve significantly better utility compared to global sensitivity approaches across both applications and both Pareto and Aggregation approaches. Moreover, the local sensitivity-based approaches are able to perform well with typical privacy budget values $\epsilon \in [0.01, 1]$ in most experiments.</description>

      <title>Nemesis: Noise-randomized Encryption with Modular Efficiency and Secure Integration in Machine Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems that guarantee security and privacy often rely on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as a cornerstone technique, enabling computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. However, a critical limitation of FHE is its computational inefficiency, making it impractical for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose \textit{Nemesis}, a framework that accelerates FHE-based systems without compromising accuracy or security. The design of Nemesis is inspired by Rache (SIGMOD'23), which introduced a caching mechanism for encrypted integers and scalars. Nemesis extends this idea with more advanced caching techniques and mathematical tools, enabling efficient operations over multi-slot FHE schemes and overcoming Rache's limitations to support general plaintext structures. We formally prove the security of Nemesis under standard cryptographic assumptions and evaluate its performance extensively on widely used datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that Nemesis significantly reduces the computational overhead of FHE-based ML systems, paving the way for broader adoption of privacy-preserving technologies.</description>

      <title>Towards Provable Security in Industrial Control Systems Via Dynamic Protocol Attestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial control systems (ICSs) increasingly rely on digital technologies vulnerable to cyber attacks. Cyber attackers can infiltrate ICSs and execute malicious actions. Individually, each action seems innocuous. But taken together, they cause the system to enter an unsafe state. These attacks have resulted in dramatic consequences such as physical damage, economic loss, and environmental catastrophes. This paper introduces a methodology that restricts actions using protocols. These protocols only allow safe actions to execute. Protocols are written in a domain specific language we have embedded in an interactive theorem prover (ITP). The ITP enables formal, machine-checked proofs to ensure protocols maintain safety properties. We use dynamic attestation to ensure ICSs conform to their protocol even if an adversary compromises a component. Since protocol conformance prevents unsafe actions, the previously mentioned cyber attacks become impossible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology using an example from the Fischertechnik Industry 4.0 platform. We measure dynamic attestation's impact on latency and throughput. Our approach is a starting point for studying how to combine formal methods and protocol design to thwart attacks intended to cripple ICSs.</description>

      <title>MAIDS: Malicious Agent Identification-based Data Security Model for Cloud Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the vigorous development of cloud computing, most organizations have shifted their data and applications to the cloud environment for storage, computation, and sharing purposes. During storage and data sharing across the participating entities, a malicious agent may gain access to outsourced data from the cloud environment. A malicious agent is an entity that deliberately breaches the data. This information accessed might be misused or revealed to unauthorized parties. Therefore, data protection and prediction of malicious agents have become a demanding task that needs to be addressed appropriately. To deal with this crucial and challenging issue, this paper presents a Malicious Agent Identification-based Data Security (MAIDS) Model which utilizes XGBoost machine learning classification algorithm for securing data allocation and communication among different participating entities in the cloud system. The proposed model explores and computes intended multiple security parameters associated with online data communication or transactions. Correspondingly, a security-focused knowledge database is produced for developing the XGBoost Classifier-based Malicious Agent Prediction (XC-MAP) unit. Unlike the existing approaches, which only identify malicious agents after data leaks, MAIDS proactively identifies malicious agents by examining their eligibility for respective data access. In this way, the model provides a comprehensive solution to safeguard crucial data from both intentional and non-intentional breaches, by granting data to authorized agents only by evaluating the agents behavior and predicting the malicious agent before granting data.</description>

      <title>FedMUP: Federated Learning driven Malicious User Prediction Model for Secure Data Distribution in Cloud Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud computing is flourishing at a rapid pace. Significant consequences related to data security appear as a malicious user may get unauthorized access to sensitive data which may be misused, further. This raises an alarm-ringing situation to tackle the crucial issue related to data security and proactive malicious user prediction. This article proposes a Federated learning driven Malicious User Prediction Model for Secure Data Distribution in Cloud Environments (FedMUP). This approach firstly analyses user behavior to acquire multiple security risk parameters. Afterward, it employs the federated learning-driven malicious user prediction approach to reveal doubtful users, proactively. FedMUP trains the local model on their local dataset and transfers computed values rather than actual raw data to obtain an updated global model based on averaging various local versions. This updated model is shared repeatedly at regular intervals with the user for retraining to acquire a better, and more efficient model capable of predicting malicious users more precisely. Extensive experimental work and comparison of the proposed model with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed work. Significant improvement is observed in the key performance indicators such as malicious user prediction accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score up to 14.32%, 17.88%, 14.32%, and 18.35%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Guided Diffusion Model for Sensor Data Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices carries detailed information about individuals in their vicinity. Sharing this data with a semi-trusted service provider may compromise the individuals' privacy, as sensitive information can be extracted by powerful machine learning models. Data obfuscation empowered by generative models is a promising approach to generate synthetic sensor data such that the useful information contained in the original data is preserved and the sensitive information is obscured. This newly generated data will then be shared with the service provider instead of the original sensor data. In this work, we propose PrivDiffuser, a novel data obfuscation technique based on a denoising diffusion model that attains a superior trade-off between data utility and privacy through effective guidance techniques. Specifically, we extract latent representations that contain information about public and private attributes from sensor data to guide the diffusion model, and impose mutual information-based regularization when learning the latent representations to alleviate the entanglement of public and private attributes, thereby increasing the effectiveness of guidance. Evaluation on three real-world datasets containing different sensing modalities reveals that PrivDiffuser yields a better privacy-utility trade-off than the state-of-the-art obfuscation model, decreasing the utility loss by up to $1.81\%$ and the privacy loss by up to $3.42\%$. Moreover, we showed that users with diverse privacy needs can use PrivDiffuser to protect their privacy without having to retrain the model.</description>

      <title>AIArena: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized AI Training Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI has underscored critical challenges in its development and implementation, largely due to centralized control by a few major corporations. This concentration of power intensifies biases within AI models, resulting from inadequate governance and oversight mechanisms. Additionally, it limits public involvement and heightens concerns about the integrity of model generation. Such monopolistic control over data and AI outputs threatens both innovation and fair data usage, as users inadvertently contribute data that primarily benefits these corporations. In this work, we propose AIArena, a blockchain-based decentralized AI training platform designed to democratize AI development and alignment through on-chain incentive mechanisms. AIArena fosters an open and collaborative environment where participants can contribute models and computing resources. Its on-chain consensus mechanism ensures fair rewards for participants based on their contributions. We instantiate and implement AIArena on the public Base blockchain Sepolia testnet, and the evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of AIArena in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Shapley Value Estimation Speedup for Efficient Explainable Quantum AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on developing efficient post-hoc explanations for quantum AI algorithms. In classical contexts, the cooperative game theory concept of the Shapley value adapts naturally to post-hoc explanations, where it can be used to identify which factors are important in an AI's decision-making process. An interesting question is how to translate Shapley values to the quantum setting and whether quantum effects could be used to accelerate their calculation. We propose quantum algorithms that can extract Shapley values within some confidence interval. Our method is capable of quadratically outperforming classical Monte Carlo approaches to approximating Shapley values up to polylogarithmic factors in various circumstances. We demonstrate the validity of our approach empirically with specific voting games and provide rigorous proofs of performance for general cooperative games.</description>

      <title>Simplicity over Complexity: An ARN-Based Intrusion Detection Method for Industrial Control Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial control network (ICN) is characterized by real-time responsiveness and reliability, which plays a key role in increasing production speed, rational and efficient processing, and managing the production process. Despite tremendous advantages, ICN inevitably struggles with some challenges, such as malicious user intrusion and hacker attack. To detect malicious intrusions in ICN, intrusion detection systems have been deployed. However, in ICN, network traffic data is equipped with characteristics of large scale, irregularity, multiple features, temporal correlation and high dimensionality, which greatly affect the efficiency and performance. To properly solve the above problems, we design a new intrusion detection method for ICN. Specifically, we first design a novel neural network model called associative recurrent network (ARN), which can properly handle the relationship between past moment hidden state and current moment information. Then, we adopt ARN to design a new intrusion detection method that can efficiently and accurately detect malicious intrusions in ICN. Subsequently, we demonstrate the high efficiency of our proposed method through theoretical computational complexity analysis. Finally, we develop a prototype implementation to evaluate the accuracy. The experimental results prove that our proposed method has sate-of-the-art performance on both the ICN dataset SWaT and the conventional network traffic dataset UNSW-NB15. The accuracies on the SWaT dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset reach 95.48% and 97.61%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive and Unconstrained Keystroke Inference in VR Platforms via Infrared Side Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are increasingly employed in numerous applications across various areas. Therefore, it is essential to ensure the security of interactions between users and VR devices. In this paper, we disclose a new side-channel leakage in the constellation tracking system of mainstream VR platforms, where the infrared (IR) signals emitted from the VR controllers for controller-headset interactions can be maliciously exploited to reconstruct unconstrained input keystrokes on the virtual keyboard non-intrusively. We propose a novel keystroke inference attack named VRecKey to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of this novel infrared side channel. Specifically, VRecKey leverages a customized 2D IR sensor array to intercept ambient IR signals emitted from VR controllers and subsequently infers (i) character-level key presses on the virtual keyboard and (ii) word-level keystrokes along with their typing trajectories. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of VRecKey with two commercial VR devices, and the results indicate that it can achieve over 94.2% and 90.5% top-3 accuracy in inferring character-level and word-level keystrokes with varying lengths, respectively. In addition, empirical results show that VRecKey is resilient to several practical impact factors and presents effectiveness in various real-world scenarios, which provides a complementary and orthogonal attack surface for the exploration of keystroke inference attacks in VR platforms.</description>

      <title>Federated Heavy Hitter Analytics with Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated heavy hitter analytics enables service providers to better understand the preferences of cross-party users by analyzing the most frequent items. As with federated learning, it faces challenges of privacy concerns, statistical heterogeneity, and expensive communication. Local differential privacy (LDP), as the \textit{de facto} standard for privacy-preserving data collection, solves the privacy challenge by letting each user perturb her data locally and report the sanitized version. However, in federated settings, applying LDP complicates the other two challenges, due to the deteriorated utility by the injected LDP noise or increasing communication/computation costs by perturbation mechanism. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel target-aligning prefix tree mechanism satisfying $\epsilon$-LDP, for federated heavy hitter analytics. In particular, we propose an adaptive extension strategy to address the inconsistencies between covering necessary prefixes and estimating heavy hitters within a party to enhance the utility. We also present a consensus-based pruning strategy that utilizes noisy prior knowledge from other parties to further align the inconsistency between finding heavy hitters in each party and providing reasonable frequency information to identify the global ones. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first solution to the federated heavy hitter analytics in a cross-party setting while satisfying the stringent $\epsilon$-LDP. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.</description>

      <title>Position: A taxonomy for reporting and describing AI security incidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI systems are vulnerable to attacks, and corresponding AI security incidents have been described. Although a collection of safety incidents around AI will become a regulatory requirement, there is no proposal to collect AI security incidents. In this position paper, we argue that a proposal should be made, taking into account the interests and needs of different stakeholders: industry, providers, users, and researchers. We thus attempt to close this gap and propose a taxonomy alongside its requirements like machine readability and link-ability with existing databases. We aim to spark discussions and enable discussion of which information is feasible, necessary, and possible to report and share within and outside organizations using AI.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the Dynamics of Buy and Sale of Social Media Accounts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a rise in online platforms facilitating the buying and selling of social media accounts. While the trade of social media profiles is not inherently illegal, social media platforms view such transactions as violations of their policies. They often take action against accounts involved in the misuse of platforms for financial gain. This research conducts a comprehensive analysis of marketplaces that enable the buying and selling of social media accounts.
  We investigate the economic scale of account trading across five major platforms: X, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. From February to June 2024, we identified 38,253 accounts advertising account sales across 11 online marketplaces, covering 211 distinct categories. The total value of marketed social media accounts exceeded \$64 million, with a median price of \$157 per account. Additionally, we analyzed the profiles of 11,457 visible advertised accounts, collecting their metadata and over 200,000 profile posts. By examining their engagement patterns and account creation methods, we evaluated the fraudulent activities commonly associated with these sold accounts. Our research reveals these marketplaces foster fraudulent activities such as bot farming, harvesting accounts for future fraud, and fraudulent engagement. Such practices pose significant risks to social media users, who are often targeted by fraudulent accounts resembling legitimate profiles and employing social engineering tactics. We highlight social media platform weaknesses in the ability to detect and mitigate such fraudulent accounts, thereby endangering users. Alongside this, we conducted thorough disclosures with the respective platforms and proposed actionable recommendations, including indicators to identify and track these accounts. These measures aim to enhance proactive detection and safeguard users from potential threats.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and Code Security: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</description>

      <title>ScamChatBot: An End-to-End Analysis of Fake Account Recovery on Social Media via Chatbots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become the hubs for various user interactions covering a wide range of needs, including technical support and services related to brands, products, or user accounts. Unfortunately, there has been a recent surge in scammers impersonating official services and providing fake technical support to users through these platforms. In this study, we focus on scammers engaging in such fake technical support to target users who are having problems recovering their accounts. More specifically, we focus on users encountering access problems with social media profiles (e.g., on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Gmail, and X) and cryptocurrency wallets. The main contribution of our work is the development of an automated system that interacts with scammers via a chatbot that mimics different personas. By initiating decoy interactions (e.g., through deceptive tweets), we have enticed scammers to interact with our system so that we can analyze their modus operandi. Our results show that scammers employ many social media profiles asking users to contact them via a few communication channels. Using a large language model (LLM), our chatbot had conversations with 450 scammers and provided valuable insights into their tactics and, most importantly, their payment profiles. This automated approach highlights how scammers use a variety of strategies, including role-playing, to trick victims into disclosing personal or financial information. With this study, we lay the foundation for using automated chat-based interactions with scammers to detect and study fraudulent activities at scale in an automated way.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ranking, Order Statistics, and Sorting under CKKS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables operations on encrypted data, making it extremely useful for privacy-preserving applications, especially in cloud computing environments. In such contexts, operations like ranking, order statistics, and sorting are fundamental functionalities often required for database queries or as building blocks of larger protocols. However, the high computational overhead and limited native operations of FHE pose significant challenges for an efficient implementation of these tasks. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that all these functionalities are based on comparing elements, which is a severely expensive operation under encryption.
  Previous solutions have typically based their designs on swap-based techniques, where two elements are conditionally swapped based on the results of their comparison. These methods aim to reduce the primary computational bottleneck: the comparison depth, which is the number of non-parallelizable homomorphic comparisons. The current state of the art solution for sorting by Lu et al. (IEEE S&amp;P'21), for instance, achieves a comparison depth of O(log^2(N)).
  In this paper, we address the challenge of reducing the comparison depth by shifting away from the swap-based paradigm. We present solutions for ranking, order statistics, and sorting, that all achieve a comparison depth of O(1), making our approach highly parallelizable. Leveraging the SIMD capabilities of the CKKS FHE scheme, our approach re-encodes the input vector under encryption to allow for simultaneous comparisons of all elements with each other. The homomorphic re-encoding incurs a minimal computational overhead of O(log(N)) rotations. Experimental results show that our approach ranks a 128-element vector in approximately 2.64s, computes its argmin/argmax in 14.18s, and sorts it in 21.10s.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap: A User Study on the Real-world Usefulness of AI-powered Vulnerability Detection &amp; Repair in the IDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical study of a vulnerability detection and fix tool with professional software developers on real projects that they own. We implemented DeepVulGuard, an IDE-integrated tool based on state-of-the-art detection and fix models, and show that it has promising performance on benchmarks of historic vulnerability data. DeepVulGuard scans code for vulnerabilities (including identifying the vulnerability type and vulnerable region of code), suggests fixes, provides natural-language explanations for alerts and fixes, leveraging chat interfaces. We recruited 17 professional software developers at Microsoft, observed their usage of the tool on their code, and conducted interviews to assess the tool's usefulness, speed, trust, relevance, and workflow integration. We also gathered detailed qualitative feedback on users' perceptions and their desired features. Study participants scanned a total of 24 projects, 6.9k files, and over 1.7 million lines of source code, and generated 170 alerts and 50 fix suggestions. We find that although state-of-the-art AI-powered detection and fix tools show promise, they are not yet practical for real-world use due to a high rate of false positives and non-applicable fixes. User feedback reveals several actionable pain points, ranging from incomplete context to lack of customization for the user's codebase. Additionally, we explore how AI features, including confidence scores, explanations, and chat interaction, can apply to vulnerability detection and fixing. Based on these insights, we offer practical recommendations for evaluating and deploying AI detection and fix models. Our code and data are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26367139.</description>

      <title>Fingerprinting Codes Meet Geometry: Improved Lower Bounds for Private Query Release and Adaptive Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fingerprinting codes are a crucial tool for proving lower bounds in differential privacy. They have been used to prove tight lower bounds for several fundamental questions, especially in the ``low accuracy'' regime. Unlike reconstruction/discrepancy approaches however, they are more suited for query sets that arise naturally from the fingerprinting codes construction. In this work, we propose a general framework for proving fingerprinting type lower bounds, that allows us to tailor the technique to the geometry of the query set. Our approach allows us to prove several new results, including the following.
  First, we show that any (sample- and population-)accurate algorithm for answering $Q$ arbitrary adaptive counting queries over a universe $\mathcal{X}$ to accuracy $\alpha$ needs $\Omega(\frac{\sqrt{\log |\mathcal{X}|}\cdot \log Q}{\alpha^3})$ samples, matching known upper bounds. This shows that the approaches based on differential privacy are optimal for this question, and improves significantly on the previously known lower bounds of $\frac{\log Q}{\alpha^2}$ and $\min(\sqrt{Q}, \sqrt{\log |\mathcal{X}|})/\alpha^2$.
  Second, we show that any $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm for answering $Q$ counting queries to accuracy $\alpha$ needs $\Omega(\frac{\sqrt{ \log|\mathcal{X}| \log(1/\delta)} \log Q}{\varepsilon\alpha^2})$ samples, matching known upper bounds up to constants. Our framework allows for proving this bound via a direct correlation analysis and improves the prior bound of [BUV'14] by $\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}$.
  Third, we characterize the sample complexity of answering a set of random $0$-$1$ queries under approximate differential privacy. We give new upper and lower bounds in different regimes. By combining them with known results, we can complete the whole picture.</description>

      <title>FRIDAY: Mitigating Unintentional Facial Identity in Deepfake Detectors Guided by Facial Recognizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous Deepfake detection methods perform well within their training domains, but their effectiveness diminishes significantly with new synthesis techniques. Recent studies have revealed that detection models often create decision boundaries based on facial identity rather than synthetic artifacts, resulting in poor performance on cross-domain datasets. To address this limitation, we propose Facial Recognition Identity Attenuation (FRIDAY), a novel training method that mitigates facial identity influence using a face recognizer. Specifically, we first train a face recognizer using the same backbone as the Deepfake detector. The recognizer is then frozen and employed during the detector's training to reduce facial identity information. This is achieved by feeding input images into both the recognizer and the detector, and minimizing the similarity of their feature embeddings through our Facial Identity Attenuating loss. This process encourages the detector to generate embeddings distinct from the recognizer, effectively reducing the impact of facial identity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances detection performance on both in-domain and cross-domain datasets.</description>

      <title>From Programming Bugs to Multimillion-Dollar Scams: An Analysis of Trapdoor Tokens on Uniswap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate in this work a recently emerged type of scam ERC-20 token called Trapdoor, which has cost investors billions of US dollars on Uniswap, the largest decentralised exchange on Ethereum, from 2020 to 2023. In essence, Trapdoor tokens allow users to buy but preventing them from selling by embedding logical bugs and/or owner-only features in their smart contracts. By manually inspecting a number of Trapdoor samples, we established the first systematic classification of Trapdoor tokens and a comprehensive list of techniques that scammers used to embed and conceal malicious codes, accompanied by a detailed analysis of representative scam contracts. In particular, we developed TrapdoorAnalyser, a fine-grained detection tool that generates and crosschecks the error-log of a buy-and-sell test and the list of embedded Trapdoor indicators from a contract-semantic check to reliably identify a Trapdoor token. TrapdoorAnalyser not only outperforms the state-of-the-art commercial tool GoPlus in accuracy, but also provides traces of malicious code with a full explanation, which most of the existing tools lack. Using TrapdoorAnalyser, we constructed the very first dataset of about 30,000 Trapdoor and non-Trapdoor tokens on UniswapV2, which allows us to train several machine learning algorithms that can detect with very high accuracy even Trapdoor tokens with no available Solidity source codes.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Consumer IoT Traffic from Security and Privacy Perspectives: a Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT), a notable segment within the IoT domain, involves the integration of IoT technology into consumer electronics and devices, such as smart homes and smart wearables. Compared to traditional IoT fields, CIoT differs notably in target users, product types, and design approaches. While offering convenience to users, it also raises new security and privacy concerns. Network traffic analysis, a widely used technique in the security community, has been extensively applied to investigate these concerns about CIoT. Compared to network traffic analysis in other fields such as mobile apps and websites, CIoT presents unique characteristics, introducing new challenges and research opportunities. Researchers have made significant contributions in this area. To aid researchers in understanding the application of traffic analysis tools for studying CIoT security and privacy risks, this survey reviews 303 publications on traffic analysis within the CIoT security and privacy domain from January 2018 to June 2024, focusing on three research questions. Our work: 1) outlines the CIoT traffic analysis process and highlights its differences from general network traffic analysis. 2) summarizes and classifies existing research into four categories according to its application objectives: device fingerprinting, user activity inference, malicious traffic detection, and measurement. 3) explores emerging challenges and potential future research directions based on each step of the CIoT traffic analysis process. This will provide new insights to the community and guide the industry towards safer product designs.</description>

      <title>SLIFER: Investigating Performance and Robustness of Malware Detection Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a result of decades of research, Windows malware detection is approached through a plethora of techniques. However, there is an ongoing mismatch between academia -- which pursues an optimal performances in terms of detection rate and low false alarms -- and the requirements of real-world scenarios. In particular, academia focuses on combining static and dynamic analysis within a single or ensemble of models, falling into several pitfalls like (i) firing dynamic analysis without considering the computational burden it requires; (ii) discarding impossible-to-analyze samples; and (iii) analyzing robustness against adversarial attacks without considering that malware detectors are complemented with more non-machine-learning components. Thus, in this paper we bridge these gaps, by investigating the properties of malware detectors built with multiple and different types of analysis. To do so, we develop SLIFER, a Windows malware detection pipeline sequentially leveraging both static and dynamic analysis, interrupting computations as soon as one module triggers an alarm, requiring dynamic analysis only when needed. Contrary to the state of the art, we investigate how to deal with samples that impede analyzes, showing how much they impact performances, concluding that it is better to flag them as legitimate to not drastically increase false alarms. Lastly, we perform a robustness evaluation of SLIFER. Counter-intuitively, the injection of new content is either blocked more by signatures than dynamic analysis, due to byte artifacts created by the attack, or it is able to avoid detection from signatures, as they rely on constraints on file size disrupted by attacks. As far as we know, we are the first to investigate the properties of sequential malware detectors, shedding light on their behavior in real production environment.</description>

      <title>SafeAligner: Safety Alignment against Jailbreak Attacks via Response Disparity Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the development of large language models (LLMs) rapidly advances, securing these models effectively without compromising their utility has become a pivotal area of research. However, current defense strategies against jailbreak attacks (i.e., efforts to bypass security protocols) often suffer from limited adaptability, restricted general capability, and high cost. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeAligner, a methodology implemented at the decoding stage to fortify defenses against jailbreak attacks. We begin by developing two specialized models: the Sentinel Model, which is trained to foster safety, and the Intruder Model, designed to generate riskier responses. SafeAligner leverages the disparity in security levels between the responses from these models to differentiate between harmful and beneficial tokens, effectively guiding the safety alignment by altering the output token distribution of the target model. Extensive experiments show that SafeAligner can increase the likelihood of beneficial tokens, while reducing the occurrence of harmful ones, thereby ensuring secure alignment with minimal loss to generality.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Unseen: Harnessing Benign Datasets for Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant ongoing efforts in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA 3 remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that can induce harmful behaviors, including through the use of adversarial suffixes. Building on prior research, we hypothesize that these adversarial suffixes are not mere bugs but may represent features that can dominate the LLM's behavior. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conduct several experiments. First, we demonstrate that benign features can be effectively made to function as adversarial suffixes, i.e., we develop a feature extraction method to extract sample-agnostic features from benign dataset in the form of suffixes and show that these suffixes may effectively compromise safety alignment. Second, we show that adversarial suffixes generated from jailbreak attacks may contain meaningful features, i.e., appending the same suffix to different prompts results in responses exhibiting specific characteristics. Third, we show that such benign-yet-safety-compromising features can be easily introduced through fine-tuning using only benign datasets. As a result, we are able to completely eliminate GPT's safety alignment in a blackbox setting through finetuning with only benign data. Our code and data is available at \url{https://github.com/suffix-maybe-feature/adver-suffix-maybe-features}.</description>

      <title>SoK: Watermarking for AI-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in addressing the broader implications of GenAI.</description>

      <title>PEFT-as-an-Attack! Jailbreaking Language Models during Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving and efficient adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in Federated Learning (FL) settings. It preserves data privacy by keeping the data decentralized and training the model on local devices, ensuring that raw data never leaves the user's device. Moreover, the integration of PEFT methods such as LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to fine-tuning the entire model, thereby minimizing communication costs and computational overhead. Despite its potential, the security implications of FedPEFT remain underexplored. This paper introduces a novel security threat to FedPEFT, termed PEFT-as-an-Attack (PaaA), which exposes how PEFT can be exploited as an attack vector to circumvent PLMs' safety alignment and generate harmful content in response to malicious prompts. Our evaluation of PaaA reveals that with less than 1% of the model's parameters set as trainable, and a small subset of clients acting maliciously, the attack achieves an approximate 80% attack success rate using representative PEFT methods such as LoRA. To mitigate this threat, we further investigate potential defense strategies, including Robust Aggregation Schemes (RASs) and Post-PEFT Safety Alignment (PPSA). However, our empirical analysis highlights the limitations of these defenses, i.e., even the most advanced RASs, such as DnC and ClippedClustering, struggle to defend against PaaA in scenarios with highly heterogeneous data distributions. Similarly, while PPSA can reduce attack success rates to below 10%, it severely degrades the model's accuracy on the target task. Our results underscore the urgent need for more effective defense mechanisms that simultaneously ensure security and maintain the performance of the FedPEFT paradigm.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Limits as a Barrier to Biometric System Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biometric systems are widely used for identity verification and identification, including authentication (i.e., one-to-one matching to verify a claimed identity) and identification (i.e., one-to-many matching to find a subject in a database). The matching process relies on measuring similarities or dissimilarities between a fresh biometric template and enrolled templates. The False Match Rate FMR is a key metric for assessing the accuracy and reliability of such systems. This paper analyzes biometric systems based on their FMR, with two main contributions. First, we explore untargeted attacks, where an adversary aims to impersonate any user within a database. We determine the number of trials required for an attacker to successfully impersonate a user and derive the critical population size (i.e., the maximum number of users in the database) required to maintain a given level of security. Furthermore, we compute the critical FMR value needed to ensure resistance against untargeted attacks as the database size increases. Second, we revisit the biometric birthday problem to evaluate the approximate and exact probabilities that two users in a database collide (i.e., can impersonate each other). Based on this analysis, we derive both the approximate critical population size and the critical FMR value needed to bound the likelihood of such collisions occurring with a given probability. These thresholds offer insights for designing systems that mitigate the risk of impersonation and collisions, particularly in large-scale biometric databases. Our findings indicate that current biometric systems fail to deliver sufficient accuracy to achieve an adequate security level against untargeted attacks, even in small-scale databases. Moreover, state-of-the-art systems face significant challenges in addressing the biometric birthday problem, especially as database sizes grow.</description>

      <title>Towards an identity management solution on Arweave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional identity management systems, often centralized, face challenges around privacy, data security, and user control, leaving users vulnerable to data breaches and misuse. This paper explores the potential of using the Arweave network to develop an identity management solution. By harnessing Arweave's permanent storage, our solution offers the users a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework, that uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to allow individuals and other entities to create, own, and manage their digital identities. Further, the solution integrates privacy-preserving technologies, including zero-knowledge proofs and the BBS(+) signature scheme, enabling selective disclosure. This approach ultimately enhances user privacy and supports compliance with European Union legislation and regulatory standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by design.</description>

      <title>UOR: Universal Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoors implanted in pre-trained language models (PLMs) can be transferred to various downstream tasks, which exposes a severe security threat. However, most existing backdoor attacks against PLMs are un-targeted and task-specific. Few targeted and task-agnostic methods use manually pre-defined triggers and output representations, which prevent the attacks from being more effective and general. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements that a more threatening backdoor attack against PLMs should satisfy, and then propose a new backdoor attack method called UOR, which breaks the bottleneck of the previous approach by turning manual selection into automatic optimization. Specifically, we define poisoned supervised contrastive learning which can automatically learn the more uniform and universal output representations of triggers for various PLMs. Moreover, we use gradient search to select appropriate trigger words which can be adaptive to different PLMs and vocabularies. Experiments show that our method can achieve better attack performance on various text classification tasks compared to manual methods. Further, we tested our method on PLMs with different architectures, different usage paradigms, and more difficult tasks, which demonstrated the universality of our method.</description>

      <title>Do Parameters Reveal More than Loss for Membership Inference?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11544v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks are used as a key tool for disclosure auditing. They aim to infer whether an individual record was used to train a model. While such evaluations are useful to demonstrate risk, they are computationally expensive and often make strong assumptions about potential adversaries' access to models and training environments, and thus do not provide tight bounds on leakage from potential attacks. We show how prior claims around black-box access being sufficient for optimal membership inference do not hold for stochastic gradient descent, and that optimal membership inference indeed requires white-box access. Our theoretical results lead to a new white-box inference attack, IHA (Inverse Hessian Attack), that explicitly uses model parameters by taking advantage of computing inverse-Hessian vector products. Our results show that both auditors and adversaries may be able to benefit from access to model parameters, and we advocate for further research into white-box methods for membership inference.</description>

      <title>CKGFuzzer: LLM-Based Fuzz Driver Generation Enhanced By Code Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the programming capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention. Fuzz testing, a highly effective technique, plays a key role in enhancing software reliability and detecting vulnerabilities. However, traditional fuzz testing tools rely on manually crafted fuzz drivers, which can limit both testing efficiency and effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose an automated fuzz testing method driven by a code knowledge graph and powered by an LLM-based intelligent agent system, referred to as CKGFuzzer. We approach fuzz driver creation as a code generation task, leveraging the knowledge graph of the code repository to automate the generation process within the fuzzing loop, while continuously refining both the fuzz driver and input seeds. The code knowledge graph is constructed through interprocedural program analysis, where each node in the graph represents a code entity, such as a function or a file. The knowledge graph-enhanced CKGFuzzer not only effectively resolves compilation errors in fuzz drivers and generates input seeds tailored to specific API usage scenarios, but also analyzes fuzz driver crash reports, assisting developers in improving code quality. By querying the knowledge graph of the code repository and learning from API usage scenarios, we can better identify testing targets and understand the specific purpose of each fuzz driver. We evaluated our approach using eight open-source software projects. The experimental results indicate that CKGFuzzer achieved an average improvement of 8.73% in code coverage compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, CKGFuzzer reduced the manual review workload in crash case analysis by 84.4% and successfully detected 11 real bugs (including nine previously unreported bugs) across the tested libraries.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Universal Adversarial Perturbations: Deceiving Vision-Language Models Across Both Images and Text with a Single Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multimodal tasks by integrating vision encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Among such attacks, Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are especially powerful, as a single optimized perturbation can mislead the model across various input images. In this work, we introduce a novel UAP specifically designed for VLMs: the Doubly-Universal Adversarial Perturbation (Doubly-UAP), capable of universally deceiving VLMs across both image and text inputs. To successfully disrupt the vision encoder's fundamental process, we analyze the core components of the attention mechanism. After identifying value vectors in the middle-to-late layers as the most vulnerable, we optimize Doubly-UAP in a label-free manner with a frozen model. Despite being developed as a black-box to the LLM, Doubly-UAP achieves high attack success rates on VLMs, consistently outperforming baseline methods across vision-language tasks. Extensive ablation studies and analyses further demonstrate the robustness of Doubly-UAP and provide insights into how it influences internal attention mechanisms.</description>
