      <title>QUEST\#4X: an extension of QUEST\#4 for benchmarking multireference wavefunction methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a number of datasets for evaluating the performance of single reference methods for the low-lying excited states of closed-shell molecules, a comprehensive dataset for assessing the performance of multireference methods for the low-lying excited states of open-shell systems is still lacking. For this reason, we propose an extension (QUEST\#4X) of the radial subset of QUEST\#4 [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16, 3720] to cover 110 doublet and 39 quartet excited states. Near-exact results obtained by iCIPT2 (iterative configuration interaction with selection and second-order perturbation correction) are taken as benchmark to calibrate SDSCI (static-dynamic-static configuration interaction) and SDSPT2 (static-dynamic-static second-order perturbation theory), which are minimal MRCI and CI-like perturbation theory, respectively. It is found that SDSCI is very close in accuracy to ic-MRCISD (internally contracted multireference configuration interaction with singles and doubles), although its computational cost is just that of one iteration of the latter. Unlike most variants of MRPT2, SDSPT2 treats single and multiple states in the same way, and performs similarly as MS-NEVPT2 (multi-state n-electron valence second-order perturbation theory). These findings put the SDS family of methods (SDSPT2, SDSCI, and iCIPT2, etc.) on a firm basis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Density Mechanics: Accurate, purely density-based \textit{ab initio} implementation of many-electron quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives and demonstrates a new, purely density-based ab initio approach for calculation of the energies and properties of many-electron systems. It is based upon the discovery of relationships that govern the "mechanics" of the electron density -- i.e., relations that connect its behaviors at different points in space. Unlike wave mechanics or prior electron-density-based implementations, such as DFT, this density-mechanical implementation of quantum mechanics involves no many-electron or one-electron wave functions (i.e., orbitals). Thus, there is no need to calculate exchange energies, because there are no orbitals to permute or "exchange" within two-electron integrals used to calculate electron-electron repulsion energies. In practice, exchange does not exist within quantum density mechanics. In fact, no two-electron integrals need be calculated at all, beyond a single coulomb integral for the 2-electron system. Instead, a "radius expansion method" is introduced that permits determination of the two-electron interaction for an N-electron system from one with (N-1)-electrons. Also, the method does not rely upon a Schrodinger-like equation or the variational method for determination of accurate energies and densities. Rather, the above-described results follow from the derivation and solution of a "governing equation" for each number of electrons to obtain a screening relation that connects the behavior at the "tail" of a one-electron density, to that at the Bohr radius. Solution of these equations produces simple expressions that deliver a total energy for a 2-electron atom that is nearly identical to the experimental value, plus accurate energies for neutral 3, 4, and 5-electron atoms, along with accurate one-electron densities of these atoms. Further, these methods scale in complexity only as N, not as a power of N, as do most other accurate many-electron methods.</description>

      <title>The first application of high-order Virial equation of state and ab initio multi-body potentials in modeling supercritical oxidation in jet-stirred reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercritical oxidation processes in jet-stirred reactors (JSR) have been modeled based on ideal gas assumption. This can lead to significant errors in or complete misinterpretation of modeling results. Therefore, this study newly developed a framework to model supercritical oxidation in JSRs by incorporating ab initio multi-body molecular potentials and high-order mixture Virial equation of state (EoS) into real-fluid conservation laws, with the related numerical strategies highlighted. With comparisons with the simulation results based on ideal EoS and the experimental data from high-pressure JSR experiments, the framework is proved to be a step forward compared to the existing JSR modeling frameworks. To reveal the real-fluid effects on the oxidation characteristics in jet-stirred reactors, simulations are further conducted at a wide range of conditions (i.e., temperatures from 500 to 1100 K and pressures from 100 to 1000 bar), the real-fluid effect is found to significantly promote fuel oxidation reactivity, especially at low temperatures, high pressures, and for mixtures with heavy fuels. The significant influences of real-fluid behaviors on JSR oxidation characteristics emphasize the need to adequately incorporate these effects for future modeling studies in JSR at high pressures, which has now been enabled through the framework proposed in this study.</description>

      <title>Highly Accurate Real-space Electron Densities with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational ab-initio methods in quantum chemistry stand out among other methods in providing direct access to the wave function. This allows in principle straightforward extraction of any other observable of interest, besides the energy, but in practice this extraction is often technically difficult and computationally impractical. Here, we consider the electron density as a central observable in quantum chemistry and introduce a novel method to obtain accurate densities from real-space many-electron wave functions by representing the density with a neural network that captures known asymptotic properties and is trained from the wave function by score matching and noise-contrastive estimation. We use variational quantum Monte Carlo with deep-learning ans\"atze (deep QMC) to obtain highly accurate wave functions free of basis set errors, and from them, using our novel method, correspondingly accurate electron densities, which we demonstrate by calculating dipole moments, nuclear forces, contact densities, and other density-based properties.</description>

      <title>Is the protactinium(V) mono-oxo bond weaker than what we thought?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bond distance is the simplest and most obvious indicator of the nature of a given chemical bond. However, for rare chemistry, it may happen that it is not yet firmly established. In this communication, we will show that the formally-triple protactinium(V) mono-oxo bond is predicted longer than what was previously reported in the solid state and in solution, based on robust quantum mechanical calculations, supported by an extensive methodological study. Furthermore, additional calculations are used to demonstrate that the Pa-Ooxo bond of interest is more sensitive to complexation than the supposedly analogous U-Oyl ones, not only in terms of bond distance but also of finer bond descriptors associated with the effective bond multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Simple H\"uckel Molecular Orbital Theory for M\"obius Carbon Nanobelts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently synthesized M\"obius carbon nanobelts (CNBs) have gained attention owing to their unique $\pi$-conjugation topology, which results in distinctive electronic properties with both fundamental and practical implications. Although M\"obius conjugation with phase inversion in atomic orbital (AO) basis is well-established for monocyclic systems, the extension of this understanding to double-stranded M\"obius CNBs remains uncertain. This study thoroughly examines the simple H\"uckel molecular orbital (SHMO) theory for describing the $\pi$ electronic structures of M\"obius CNBs. We demonstrate that the adjacency matrix for any M\"obius CNB is isomorphism invariant under different placements of the sign inversion, ensuring identical SHMO results regardless of AO phase inversion location. Representative examples of M\"obius CNBs, including the experimentally synthesized one, show that the H\"uckel molecular orbitals (MOs) strikingly resemble the DFT-computed $\pi$ MOs, which were obtained using a herein proposed technique based on the localization and re-delocalization of DFT canonical MOs. Interestingly, the lower-lying $\pi$ MOs exhibit an odd number of nodal planes and are doubly quasidegenerate as a consequence of the phase inversion in M\"obius macrocycles, contrasting with macrocyclic H\"uckel systems. Coulson bond orders derived from SHMO theory correlate well with DFT-calculated Wiberg bond indices for all C-C bonds in tested M\"obius CNBs. Additionally, a remarkable correlation is observed between HOMO-LUMO gaps obtained from the SHMO and GFN2-xTB calculations for a large number of topoisomers of M\"obius CNBs. Thus, the SHMO model not only captures the essence of $\pi$ electronic structure of M\"obius CNBs, but also provides reliable quantitative predictions comparable to DFT results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic ($p,\rho,T$) characterization of a reference high-calorific natural gas mixture when hydrogen is added up to 20 % (mol/mol)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The injection of hydrogen into the natural-gas grid is an alternative during the process of a gradual decarbonization of the heat and power supply. When dealing with hydrogen-enriched natural gas mixtures, the performance of the reference equations of state habitually used for natural gas should be validated by using high-precision experimental thermophysical data from multicomponent reference mixtures prepared with the lowest possible uncertainty in composition. In this work, we present experimental density data for an 11-compound high-calorific (hydrogen-free) natural gas mixture and for two derived hydrogen-enriched natural gas mixtures prepared by adding (10 and 20) mol-% of hydrogen to the original standard natural gas mixture. The three mixtures were prepared gravimetrically according to ISO 6142-1 for maximum precision in their composition and thus qualify for reference materials. A single-sinker densimeter was used to determine the density of the mixtures from (250-350) K and up to 20 MPa. The experimental density results of this work have been compared to the densities calculated by three different reference equations of state for natural gas related mixtures: the AGA8-DC92 EoS, the GERG-2008 EoS, and an improved version of the GERG-2008 EoS. While relative deviations of the experimental density data for the hydrogen-free natural gas mixture are always within the claimed uncertainty of the three considered equations of state, larger deviations can be observed for the hydrogen-enriched natural gas mixtures from any of the three equations of state, especially for the lowest temperature and the highest pressures.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Ab Initio Hagedorn Wavepacket Dynamics: Single Vibronic Level Fluorescence Spectra of Difluorocarbene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hagedorn wavepackets have been used with local harmonic approximation to partially capture the anharmonic effects on single vibronic level (SVL) spectra in model potentials. To make the Hagedorn approach practical for realistic anharmonic polyatomic molecules, here we combine local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics with on-the-fly ab initio dynamics. We then test this method by computing the SVL fluorescence spectra of difluorocarbene, a small, floppy molecule with a very anharmonic potential energy surface. Our time-dependent approach obtains the emission spectra of all initial vibrational levels from a single anharmonic semiclassical wavepacket trajectory without the need to fit individual anharmonic vibrational wavefunctions and to calculate the Franck--Condon factors for all vibronic transitions. We show that, whereas global harmonic models are inadequate for CF$_2$, the spectra computed with the on-the-fly local harmonic Hagedorn wavepacket dynamics agree well with experimental data, especially for low initial excitations.</description>

      <title>On the design space between molecular mechanics and machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A force field as accurate as quantum mechanics (QM) and as fast as molecular mechanics (MM), with which one can simulate a biomolecular system efficiently enough and meaningfully enough to get quantitative insights, is among the most ardent dreams of biophysicists -- a dream, nevertheless, not to be fulfilled any time soon. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) represent a meaningful endeavor towards this direction, where differentiable neural functions are parametrized to fit ab initio energies, and furthermore forces through automatic differentiation. We argue that, as of now, the utility of the MLFF models is no longer bottlenecked by accuracy but primarily by their speed (as well as stability and generalizability), as many recent variants, on limited chemical spaces, have long surpassed the chemical accuracy of $1$ kcal/mol -- the empirical threshold beyond which realistic chemical predictions are possible -- though still magnitudes slower than MM. Hoping to kindle explorations and designs of faster, albeit perhaps slightly less accurate MLFFs, in this review, we focus our attention on the design space (the speed-accuracy tradeoff) between MM and ML force fields. After a brief review of the building blocks of force fields of either kind, we discuss the desired properties and challenges now faced by the force field development community, survey the efforts to make MM force fields more accurate and ML force fields faster, envision what the next generation of MLFF might look like.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many first-passage processes in complex media and related diffusion-controlled reactions can be described by means of eigenfunctions of the mixed Steklov-Neumann problem. In this paper, we investigate this spectral problem in a common setting when a small target or escape window (with Steklov condition) is located on the reflecting boundary (with Neumann condition). We start by inspecting two basic settings: an arc-shaped target on the boundary of a disk and a spherical-cap-shaped target on the boundary of a ball. We construct the explicit kernel of an integral operator that determines the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and deduce their asymptotic behavior in the small-target limit. By relating the limiting kernel to an appropriate Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, we extend these asymptotic results to other bounded domains with smooth boundaries. A straightforward application to first-passage processes is presented; in particular, we revisit the small-target behavior of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets, as well as for more sophisticated surface reactions that extend the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>Electrolyte spraying within H$_2$ bubbles during water electrolysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrolytically generated gas bubbles can significantly hamper the overall electrolysis efficiency. Therefore it is crucial to understand their dynamics in order to optimise water electrolyzer systems. Here we demonstrate a distinct transport mechanism where coalescence with microbubbles drives electrolyte droplets, resulting from the fragmentation of the Worthington jet, into the gas phase during hydrogen evolution reaction, both in normal and microgravity environments. This indicates that the H$_2$ bubble is not only composed of hydrogen gas and vapor but also includes electrolyte fractions. Reminiscent of bursting bubbles on a liquid-gas interface, this behavior results in a flow inside the bubble, which is further affected by Marangoni convection at the gas-electrolyte interface, highlighting interface mobility. In the case of electrode-attached bubbles, the sprayed droplets form electrolyte puddles at the bubble-electrode contact area, affecting the dynamics near the three-phase contact line and favoring bubble detachment from the electrode. The results of this work unravel important insights into the physicochemical aspects of electrolytic gas bubbles, integral for optimizing gas-evolving electrochemical systems. Besides, our findings are essential for studying the limits of jet formation and rupture relevant to acid mist formation in electrowinning, generation of sea spray aerosols, impact of droplets on liquid surfaces, etc.</description>

      <title>Extended dissipaton-equation-of-motion approach to study the electronic migration in adatom-graphene composite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene has garnered significant attention due to its unique properties. Among its many intriguing characteristics, the tuning effects induced by adsorbed atoms (adatoms) provide immense potential for the design of graphene-based electronic devices. This work explores the electronic migration in the adatom-graphene composite, using the extended dissipaton-equation-of-motion (DEOM) approach. As an exact dynamics theory for open quantum systems embedded in environments composed of non-interacting electrons, the extended DEOM is capable of handling both linear and quadratic environmental couplings (a certain non-Gaussian effect) which account for the interactions between the adatom and the graphene substrate. We demonstrate and analyze the adatom-graphene correlated properties and the tuning effects by simulating the adatom spectral functions with varied Coulomb repulsion strengths. This work offers not only advanced theoretical methods but also new insights into the theoretical investigation of complex functional materials such as graphene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Construction of High-Fidelity Graph Deep Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become an indispensable tool in large-scale atomistic simulations because of their ability to reproduce ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) very accurately at a fraction of computational cost. For computational efficiency, the training data for most MLPs today are computed using relatively cheap density functional theory (DFT) methods such as the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional. Meta-GGAs such as the recently developed strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional have been shown to yield significantly improved descriptions of atomic interactions for diversely bonded systems, but their higher computational cost remains an impediment to their use in MLP development. In this work, we outline a data-efficient multi-fidelity approach to constructing Materials 3-body Graph Network (M3GNet) interatomic potentials that integrate different levels of theory within a single model. Using silicon and water as examples, we show that a multi-fidelity M3GNet model trained on a combined dataset of low-fidelity GGA calculations with 10% of high-fidelity SCAN calculations can achieve accuracies comparable to a single-fidelity M3GNet model trained on a dataset comprising 8x the number of SCAN calculations. This work paves the way for the development of high-fidelity MLPs in a cost-effective manner by leveraging existing low-fidelity datasets.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Photo-Physical Properties of Plexcitons in Strongly Coupled Metal-Organic Thin Films</title>

Abstract: Exciton plasmon polaritons have gained increasing interests over recent years due to their versatile properties emerging by the underlying light-matter coupling and making them potential candidates for new photonic applications. We have advanced this concept by studying thin films of laterally aligned J-type aggregates of self-assembled tetra-bay phenoxy-dendronized perylene bisimide (PBI) molecules, arranged in a helical manner of three strains on a silver surface. As a result of the interaction between the uniformly aligned dipole moments and the surface plasmons of a thin silver layer underneath, the excitonic state at 1.94 eV evolves into dispersions in absorption and emission, both characterized by a distinct anisotropy. The coupling constant defined by the scalar product of the transition dipole moment $\vec{\mu}$ and the surface plasmon wavevector $\vec{k}_x$ shows a pronounced two-fold rotational symmetry with values between almost 0 to 28 meV. Complementary TD-DFT calculations of the angular dependent absorption and photoluminescence provide insights in the coherent energy exchange between the excitonic and plasmonic sub-systems. Additionally, power dependent PL studies yield first evidence that the diffusion length of the coupled exciton-plasmon polaritons exceeds that of the mere Frenkel state in neat PBI by at least one order of magnitude. Our results not only demonstrate the possibility to control the photo-physical properties of strongly coupled states by their spatially anisotropic light-matter interaction but also reveal innovative strategies to influence opto-electronic device operation by the directional transport of hybrid state energy.</description>

      <title>Chemical tuning of quantum spin-electric coupling in molecular nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling quantum spins using electric rather than magnetic fields promises significant architectural advantages for developing quantum technologies. In this context, spins in molecular nanomagnets offer tunability of spin-electric couplings (SEC) by rational chemical design. Here we demonstrate systematic control of SECs in a family of Mn(II)-containing molecules via chemical engineering. The trigonal bipyramidal (tbp) molecular structure with C3 symmetry leads to a significant molecular electric dipole moment that is directly connected to its magnetic anisotropy. The interplay between these two features gives rise to significant experimentally observed SECs, which can be rationalised by wavefunction theoretical calculations. Our findings guide strategies for the development of electrically controllable molecular spin qubits for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>The relationship between structure and excited-state properties in polyanilines from geminal-based methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods to study the structure-to-property relationship in polyanilines (PANIs) of different lengths and oxidation states. Specifically, we focus on leucoemeraldine, emeraldine, and pernigraniline in their tetramer and octamer forms. We scrutinize their structural properties, HOMO and LUMO energies, HOMO-LUMO gaps, and vibrational and electronic spectroscopy using various Density Functional Approximations (DFAs). Furthermore, the accuracy of DFAs is assessed by comparing them to experimental and wavefunction-based reference data. We perform large-scale orbital-optimized pair-Coupled Cluster Doubles (oo-pCCD) calculations for ground and electronically excited states and conventional Configuration Interaction Singles (CIS) calculations for electronically excited states in all investigated systems. The EOM-pCCD+S approach with pCCD-optimized orbitals allows us to unambiguously identify charge transfer and local transitions across the investigated PANI systems -- an analysis not possible within a delocalized canonical molecular orbital basis obtained, for instance, by DFAs. We show that the low-lying part of the emeraldine and pernigraniline spectrum is dominated by charge transfer excitations and that polymer elongation changes the character of the leading transitions. Furthermore, we augment our study with a quantum informational analysis of orbital correlations in various forms of PANIs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory Calculations by Coupling Orbital and Occupation Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) calculations are usually implemented in a decoupled manner, where the orbital and occupation optimizations are repeated alternately. Typically, orbital updates are performed using the unitary optimization method, while occupations are optimized through the explicit-by-implicit (EBI) method. The EBI method addresses explicit constraints by incorporating implicit functions, effectively transforming constrained optimization scenarios into unconstrained minimizations. Although the unitary and EBI methods individually achieve robust performance in optimizing orbitals and occupations, respectively, the decoupled optimization methods often suffer from slow convergence and require dozens of alternations between the orbital and occupation optimizations. To address this issue, this work proposes a coupled optimization method that combines unitary and EBI optimizations to update orbitals and occupations simultaneously at each step. To achieve favorable convergence in coupled optimization using a simple first-order algorithm, an effective and efficient preconditioner and line search are further introduced. The superiority of the new method is demonstrated through numerous tests on different molecules, random initial guesses, different basis sets and different functionals. It outperforms all decoupled optimization methods in terms of convergence speed, convergence results and convergence stability. Even a large system like $\mathrm{C_{60}}$ can converge to $10^{-8}$ au in 154 iterations, which shows that the coupled optimization method can make RDMFT more practical and facilitate its wider application and further development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive theoretical understanding of electron-photon correlation is essential for describing the reshaping of molecular orbitals in quantum electrodynamics (QED) environments. The strong coupling QED Hartree-Fock (SC-QED-HF) theory tackles these aspects by providing consistent molecular orbitals in the strong coupling regime. The previous implementation, however, has significant convergence issues that limit the applicability. In this work we introduce two second-order algorithms that significantly reduce the computational requirements, thereby enhancing the modeling of large molecular systems in QED environments. Furthermore, the implementation will enable the development of correlated methods based on a reliable molecular orbital framework.</description>

      <title>Fragment quantum embedding using the Householder transformation: a multi-state extension based on ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent works by Yalouz et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 157, 214112, 2022) and Sekaran et al. (Phys. Rev. B 104, 035121, 2021; Computation 10, 45, 2022), Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) has been reformulated through the use of the Householder transformation as a novel tool to embed a fragment within extended systems. The transformation was applied to a reference non-interacting one-electron reduced density matrix to construct fragments' bath orbitals, which are crucial for subsequent ground state calculations. In the present work, we expand upon these previous developments and extend the utilization of the Householder transformation to the description of multiple electronic states, including ground and excited states. Based on an ensemble noninteracting density matrix, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving exact fragment embedding through successive Householder transformations, resulting in a larger set of bath orbitals. We analytically prove that the number of additional bath orbitals scales directly with the number of fractionally occupied natural orbitals in the reference ensemble density matrix. A connection with the regular DMET bath construction is also made. Then, we illustrate the use of this ensemble embedding tool in single-shot DMET calculations to describe both ground and first excited states in a Hubbard lattice model and an ab initio hydrogen system. Lastly, we discuss avenues for enhancing ensemble embedding through self-consistency and explore potential future directions.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are irreplaceable and ubiquitous in fields of materials science, chemistry, pharmacology just to name a few. Conventional MD simulations are plagued by numerical stability as well as long equilibration time issues, which limits broader applications of MD simulations. Recently, a surge of deep learning approaches have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which learns the state transition mechanism over much larger time scales to overcome these limitations. However, only a few methods target the underlying Boltzmann distribution by resampling techniques, where proposals are rarely accepted as new states with low efficiency. In this work, we propose a force-guided bridge matching model, FBM, a novel framework that first incorporates physical priors into bridge matching for full-atom time-coarsened dynamics. With the guidance of our well-designed intermediate force field, FBM is feasible to target the Boltzmann-like distribution by direct inference without extra steps. Experiments on small peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen peptide systems.</description>

      <title>From Static to Dynamic Structures: Improving Binding Affinity Prediction with Graph-Based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is an essential challenge in structure-based drug design. Despite recent advances in data-driven methods for affinity prediction, their accuracy is still limited, partially because they only take advantage of static crystal structures while the actual binding affinities are generally determined by the thermodynamic ensembles between proteins and ligands. One effective way to approximate such a thermodynamic ensemble is to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Here, an MD dataset containing 3,218 different protein-ligand complexes is curated, and Dynaformer, a graph-based deep learning model is further developed to predict the binding affinities by learning the geometric characteristics of the protein-ligand interactions from the MD trajectories. In silico experiments demonstrated that the model exhibits state-of-the-art scoring and ranking power on the CASF-2016 benchmark dataset, outperforming the methods hitherto reported. Moreover, in a virtual screening on heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) using Dynaformer, 20 candidates are identified and their binding affinities are further experimentally validated. Dynaformer displayed promising results in virtual drug screening, revealing 12 hit compounds (two are in the submicromolar range), including several novel scaffolds. Overall, these results demonstrated that the approach offer a promising avenue for accelerating the early drug discovery process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the lowest excited states of a quantum system which is a natural generalization of the estimation of ground states. The method has no free parameters and requires no explicit orthogonalization of the different states, instead transforming the problem of finding excited states of a given system into that of finding the ground state of an expanded system. Expected values of arbitrary observables can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations between different states such as the transition dipole moment. Although the method is entirely general, it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural networks as variational Ans\"atze for many-electron systems, and we show that by combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ans\"atze we can accurately recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on a range of molecules. Our method is the first deep learning approach to achieve accurate vertical excitation energies, including challenging double excitations, on benzene-scale molecules. Beyond the chemistry examples here, we expect this technique will be of great interest for applications to atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics: A Universal and Compact Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovianity, the intricate dependence of an open quantum system on its temporal evolution history, holds tremendous implications across various scientific disciplines. However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.</description>

Abstract: Magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) are a potential field for the energy storage of the future but are restricted by insufficient rate capability and rapid capacity degradation. Magnesium-sodium hybrid ion batteries (MSHBs) are an effective way to address these problems. Here, we report a new type of MSHBs that use layered sodium vanadate ((Na, Mn)V8O20 5H2O, Mn-NVO) cathodes coupled with an organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode in Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. During electrochemical cycling, Mg2+ and Na+ co-participate in the cathode reactions, and the introduction of Na+ promotes the structural stability of the Mn-NVO cathode, as cleared by several ex-situ characterizations. Consequently, the Mn-NVO cathode presents great specific capacity (249.9 mAh g-1 at 300 mA g-1) and cycling (1500 cycles at 1500 mA g-1) in the Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. Besides, full battery displays long lifespan with 10,000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The rate performance and cycling stability of MSHBs have been improved by an economical and scalable method, and the mechanism for these improvements was discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on detachment characteristics of hydrogen bubbles during electrolysis. Using a transparent (Pt or Ni) electrode enables us to directly observe the bubble contact line and bubble size. Based on these quantities we determine other parameters such as the contact angle and volume through solutions of the Young-Laplace equation. We observe bubbles without ('pinned bubbles') and with ('spreading bubbles') contact line spreading, and find that the latter mode becomes more prevalent if the concentration of HClO4 is greater than or equal to 0.1 M. The departure radius for spreading bubbles is found to drastically exceed the value predicted by the well-known formula of W. Fritz (Physik. Zeitschr. 1935, 36, 379-384) for this case. We show that this is related to the contact line hysteresis, which leads to pinning of the contact line after an initial spreading phase at the receding contact angle. The departure mode is then similar to a pinned bubble and occurs once the contact angle reaches the advancing contact angle of the surface. A prediction for the departure radius based on these findings is found to be consistent with the experimental data.</description>

Abstract: A widely accepted phenomenological rule states that solids with free surfaces cannot be overheated. In this work we discuss this statement critically under the light of the statistical thermodynamics of interfacial roughening transitions. Our results show that the basal face of ice as described by the TIP4P/Ice model can remain mechanically stable for more than one hundred nanoseconds when overheated by 1 K, and for several hundreds of nanoseconds at smaller overheating despite the presence of a significant quasi-liquid layer at the surface. Such time scales, which are often of little experimental significance, can become a concern for the determination of melting points by computer simulations using the direct coexistence method. In the light of this observation, we reinterpret computer simulations of ice premelting and show that current results for the TIP4P/Ice model all imply a scenario of incomplete surface melting. Using a thermodynamic integration path, we reassess our own estimates for the Laplace pressure difference between water and vapor. These calculations are used to measure the disjoining pressure of premelting liquid films and allow us to confirm a minimum of the interfacial free energy at finite premelting thickness of about one nanometer.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Optoelectronic Processes in Colloidal 2D Multi-Layered MAPbBr3 Perovskite Nanosheets: Funneling, Recombination and Self-Trapped Excitons</title>

Abstract: Quasi two-dimensional (2D) colloidal synthesis made quantum confinement readily accessible in perovskites, generating additional momentum in perovskite LED research and lasing. Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton binding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for solar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different thickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker layers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms by which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures is lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n = 3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n &gt; 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives comprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination processes. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes dominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5, Eb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their exciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative recombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping processes, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping when high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n regions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is bypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.</description>

      <title>Non-ideal mixing of lipids: a molecular dynamics perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lipid membranes have complex compositions and modeling the thermodynamic properties of multi-component lipid systems remains a remote goal. In this work we attempt to describe the thermodynamics of binary lipid mixtures by mapping coarse-grained molecular dynamics systems to two-dimensional simple fluid mixtures. By computing and analysing the density fluctuations of this model lipid bilayer we determine the numerical value of the quadratic coupling term appearing in a model of regular solutions for the DPPC-DLiPC pair of lipids at three different compositions. Our methodology is general and discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Influence of Nonequilibrium Vibrational Dynamics on Spin Selectivity in Chiral Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of molecular vibrations in the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in the context of charge transport through a molecular nanojunction. We employ a mixed quantum-classical approach that combines Ehrenfest dynamics for molecular vibrations with the hierarchical equations of motion method for the electronic degrees of freedom. This approach treats the molecular vibrations in a nonequilibrium manner, which is crucial for the dynamics of molecular nanojunctions. To explore the effect of vibrational dynamics on spin selectivity, we also introduce a new figure of merit, the displacement polarization, which quantifies the difference in vibrational displacements for opposing lead magnetizations. We analyze the dynamics of single trajectories, investigating how the spin selectivity depends on voltage and electronic-vibrational coupling. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics and temperature dependence of ensemble-averaged observables. We demonstrate that spin selectivity is correlated in time with the vibrational polarization, indicating that dynamics of the molecular vibrations is the driving force of CISS in this model within the Ehrenfest approach.</description>
