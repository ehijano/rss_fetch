      <title>On the dynamical stability of skeletal muscle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been debate for over 70-years about whether active skeletal muscle is dynamically stable at lengths greater than its optimal length. The stability of computational muscle models is a critical issue, as it directly affects our ability to simulate muscle deformation across different operating lengths, especially at lengths where muscles are known to remain functional despite model-predicted instabilities.
  In this study, we revisit the question of dynamical stability of ODE-based models of skeletal muscle. In particular, we investigate whether activation-independent tissue properties can provide stability to contractions along the dip region of the total force-length curve. First, using a combination of analytical tools (eigenvalue analysis and non-dimensionalization) and numerical simulations, we confirm that traditional Hill-type muscle models can display divergent dynamics in this region. Then, we propose a stabilized version of a 1D Hill-type muscle model that incorporates the 3D nature of skeletal muscle deformation. This results in a completely convex force-length relationship that can bring robustness to numerical simulations, while preserving the computational efficiency of 1D models. Our findings suggest that activation-independent intrinsic mechanical properties of muscle are sufficient to stabilize contractions even in the dip region, offering new insight into how muscles maintain functional integrity during active stretch.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of a General-Purpose Deep Learning Dose Engine: A Multi-Site Validation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional radiotherapy dose calculation algorithms are often computationally slow and non-differentiable, creating bottlenecks for online adaptive radiotherapy (ART) and limiting end-to-end automatic planning. Deep learning provides consistent inference performance and a differentiable framework essential for rapid optimization. In this study, we developed a generalized, site-independent deep learning dose engine using a beamlet-based input strategy. This establishes a computationally consistent and differentiable module that enables end-to-end training for autoplanning while maintaining accuracy across diverse geometries. A dataset of 3,600 plans from 120 patients across six anatomical sites was used to train two 3D convolutional neural networks, a standard U-Net and a Cascade U-Net, to predict 3D dose distributions from CT images and divergent MLC/jaw projections. Performance was validated via 3D gamma analysis on an independent cohort of 60 VMAT plans. The optimal model (U-Net with MAE loss) achieved a mean gamma passing rate of $98.9 \pm 1.6\%$ (3%/2mm, 10% threshold). Performance remained robust across all sites (passing rates $&gt;98\%$), demonstrating that the beamlet-based strategy generalizes effectively to complex geometries without site-specific training. These results indicate that a single, site-independent model can calculate radiotherapy dose distributions with clinical accuracy. This differentiable engine is highly suitable for integration into end-to-end automatic planning, online ART, and secondary dose verification workflows.</description>

      <title>Effect of Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Material Properties on Simulated Transcatheter Pulmonary Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations emulating transcatheter pulmonary valve (TPV) system deployment in patient-specific right ventricular outflow tracts (RVOT) assume material properties for the RVOT and adjacent tissues. Sensitivity of the deployment to variation in RVOT material properties is unknown. Moreover, the effect of a transannular patch stiffness and location on simulated TPV deployment has not been explored. A sensitivity analysis on the material properties of a patient-specific RVOT during TPV deployment, modeled as an uncoupled HGO material, was conducted using FEBioUncertainSCI. Further, the effects of a transannular patch during TPV deployment were analyzed by considering two patch locations and four patch stiffnesses. Visualization of results and quantification were performed using custom metrics implemented in SlicerHeart and FEBio. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the shear modulus of the ground matrix (c), fiber modulus (k1), and fiber mean orientation angle (gamma) had the greatest effect on 95th %ile stress, whereas only c had the greatest effect on 95th %ile Lagrangian strain. First-order sensitivity indices contributed the greatest to the total-order sensitivity indices. Simulations using a transannular patch revealed that peak stress and strain were dependent on patch location. As stiffness of the patch increased, greater stress was observed at the interface connecting the patch to the RVOT, and stress in the patch itself increased while strain decreased. The total enclosed volume by the TPV device remained unchanged across all simulated patch cases. This study highlights that while uncertainties in tissue material properties and patch locations may influence functional outcomes, FE simulations provide a reliable framework for evaluating these outcomes in TPVR.</description>

      <title>Group-patch joint compression for highly accelerated MRI: compressing dynamic B0 and static RF spatial modulations across k-space subregion groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To accelerate MRI further, rapid B0 field modulations can be applied during oversampled readout to capture additional physical information, e.g., Wave-CAIPI, FRONSAC, local B0 coils modulations. These methods, however, introduce additional non-Fourier-encoded dimension that cannot be resolved by FFT, posing significant reconstruction challenges particularly in compressed-sensing or neural-network frameworks.
  Theory and methods: Because B0 modulations vary slowly relative to the oversampled ADC dwell time, we exploit this encoding redundancy by compressing k-space patch-by-patch across subregions, each of which is jointly encoded by a distinct subset of B0 and RF (receive) spatial encoding functions. For each patch, a compression matrix is computed once and reused to compress all patches encoded by the same B0/RF spatial modulations. This can be implemented by feeding subsets of B0 and RF spatial encoding maps into an adapted conventional RF array compression algorithm, mimicking an expanded set of virtual receiver channels. This approach was evaluated on ex-vivo/in-vivo human brain scans at 9.4T/3T.
  Results: The proposed group-patch joint compression achieves substantially higher compression factors than conventional RF-only compression, while minimally compromising encoding efficiency. Typically, joint compression factors of 11x-20x led to negligible encoding loss, dramatically reducing reconstruction time and peak memory usage. For example, compressed-sensing reconstruction took 1.4-5.1s/2D slice, 177s-10.1min/3D volume, on a high-memory CPU node.
  Conclusion: Given joint encoding of dynamic B0 and static RF fields, compressing multidimensional k-space patches in separate groups outperforms compressing RF receiver channels alone. This substantially mitigates a fundamental computational bottleneck that arises when combining rapid B0 and RF-receiver modulations.</description>

      <title>Group-kernel auto-calibration and group-patch k-space reconstruction: Fast MRI with time-variant B0 kernels partitioned into time-invariant subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Pushing MRI speed further demands more spatially-encoded information captured per unit time, e.g., by superimposing additional field modulations during oversampled readout. However, this can introduce calibration errors and increase reconstruction time. Thus, we propose a continuous field calibration approach and an efficient k-space reconstruction technique.
  Theory and Methods: Our auto-calibration generalizes GRAPPA kernels to explicitly extract continuous B0 modulation kernels, solving interpolation relationships between two ACS regions differing only in the extra field modulation. The k-space locations sharing the same instantaneous image-space modulation are grouped, so that subsets of time-invariant kernels can be separately estimated, as a generalized solution for Wave-CAIPI/FRONSAC-type scans. This view further inspires a k-space subregion-wise reconstruction technique, as an efficient alternative to conventional hybrid-space reconstruction. At 9.4T, FLASH accelerated by a local B0 coil array and Wave-CAIPI were tested with retrospective undersampling.
  Results: Artifact-free images were reconstructed, under diverse rapid B0 modulation schemes, reaching maximum acceleration factors of 8-fold in 2D and 14.6-fold in 3D. Some nonlinear gradients modulation schemes reach similar sampling efficiency as linear gradients modulation. The proposed reconstruction shows potentials in reducing reconstruction time.
  Conclusion: Rapid B0 modulations and widely-adopted parallel imaging can share a common mathematical framework, and consequently, achieve similarly-robust reconstructions. Specifically, for scans using dynamic B0 and static RF kernels, not only signal encoding, but also auto-calibration and reconstruction can be performed in k-space. This paves the way to robustly remove eddy currents, and explore more complex B0 modulation strategies towards ultimate MRI speed.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of Inter-crystal Scattering in PET: Analytical Models and Dedicated Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-crystal scattering (ICS) in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is commonly regarded as a degradation effect that might compromise the image spatial resolution. In parallel, the inclusion of ICS events has also been recognized as a potential approach to increase PET sensitivity, which could be especially beneficial in scenarios where the latter is a limiting factor, such as very small animal imaging. Several methods for the recovery of ICS events have been proposed, many of which aim to locate the first interaction, i.e., the Compton scattering site, usually limited by their success rate, computational burden or data and training dependency. Conversely, this work proposes a physics-based model for ICS events, leading to analytical expressions of the sensitivity image and the system matrix (required by statistical reconstruction algorithms), without the need to identify the original line of response. After validating the model, the work shows how ICS events can be integrated into a joint image reconstruction algorithm (based on list-mode MLEM) together with conventional PET events, for which dedicated analytical models are also developed. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, Monte-Carlo simulated and experimental data of an image quality phantom were obtained with the MERMAID small-fish PET scanner prototype. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that, while slightly decreasing the recovery coefficient values, the inclusion of ICS clearly reduces statistical noise and improves uniformity.</description>

      <title>All-optical photoacoustic tomography via beam deflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) uniquely combines the advantages of optical contrast with deep tissue penetration capability of acoustic waves, enabling imaging at depths of several centimeters. Conventional photoacoustic imaging methods have relied on pulsed lasers to induce the photoacoustic effect, coupled with arrays of pressure transducers to detect the resulting ultrasound signals. In this work, we propose an alternative all-optical approach that leverages optical deflection to record photoacoustic waves by an array of detection beams. The measured signal is shown to be the Radon transform of the pressure gradients. An optimization-based inversion procedure is used to reconstruct the initial time pressure gradient field. Subsequently, a Galerkin method is used to reconstruct the pressure field from the pressure gradient field. The new modality offers the potential for enhanced sensitivity and reduced signal distortion, advancing the capabilities of photoacoustic imaging beyond traditional transducer-based systems.</description>
