      <title>Transient and Periodic Steady-State Characteristics of the Local Heat Transfer Measurement by Thermal Perturbation with Gaussian Power Density Distribution &amp; A Supplementary Perspective with Comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local heat transfer coefficient measurement with temperature oscillation induced by periodic thermal perturbation - usually via a Gaussian laser beam, was investigated for the impact of the spikiness (i.e., the standard deviation) elaborated in comparison with the analytical model for dimensional analysis. The statistically more robust technique that relies on the linearity of the spatial phase distribution of the test point array was favored when the target Biot number approaches unity in terms of its order of magnitude. The preferred upper limit for thermographic scanning was discussed as the simplification of later data processing is concerned. Nonetheless, the time elapsed for an acceptable periodic steady state, which in principle leans to the higher end of the target Biot number spectrum in a log scale, indicates the benefit from the time series of pointwise temperature measurement - as in the conventional single-blow testing, where the effect of spikiness, as well as that of the location of individual test point, holds. Note that the vicinity as the target Biot number approaches unity was again observed with higher preference. A supplementary perspective was provided to the concerns, including noise tolerance, sampling rate, test duration, the spikiness of the imposed heat flux, and the accuracy-related parameters, in the measurement of local Biot number with thermal perturbation. The optimization was implemented with a Gaussian process surrogate model for data processing, within the specified parametric range of interest. The two commonly employed temporal modes of the imposed heat flux were compared with counterintuitive features discussed.</description>

      <title>The distribution of violent events and interevent times in conflicts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Violent conflicts are interrupted by intervals without violence. These interevent times are said have a power law distribution, but this is only true for coarse grained data, typically with a resolution of one day. For fine grained data, with a resolution of milliseconds, the distribution is lognormal. By representing conflicts as a multiplicative process, it becomes clear why these two different distributions are found.</description>

      <title>Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Hardware Acceleration in High-Energy Physics through High-Level Synthesis Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the Large Hadron Collider, the vast amount of data from experiments demands not only sophisticated algorithms but also substantial computational power for efficient processing. This paper introduces hardware acceleration as an essential advancement for high-energy physics data analysis, focusing specifically on the application of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) to bridge the gap between complex software algorithms and their hardware implementation. We will explore how HLS facilitates the direct implementation of software algorithms into hardware platforms such as FPGAs, enhancing processing speeds and enabling real-time data analysis. This will be highlighted through the case study of a track-finding algorithm for muon reconstruction with the CMS experiment, demonstrating HLS's role in translating computational tasks into high-speed, low-latency hardware solutions for particle detection and reconstruction. Key techniques in HLS, including parallel processing, pipelining, and memory optimization, will be discussed, illustrating how they contribute to the efficient acceleration of algorithms in high-energy physics. We will also cover design methodologies and iterative processes in HLS to optimize performance and resource utilization, alongside a brief mention of additional techniques like algorithm approximation and hardware / software co-design. In short, this paper will underscore the potential of hardware acceleration in high-energy physics research, emphasizing HLS as a powerful tool for physicists to enhance computational efficiency and foster groundbreaking discoveries.</description>
