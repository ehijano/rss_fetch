      <title>Worldtube excision method for intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals: self-consistent evolution in a scalar-charge model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a third installment in a program to develop a method for alleviating the scale disparity in binary black hole simulations with mass ratios in the intermediate astrophysical range, where simulation cost is prohibitive while purely perturbative methods may not be adequate. The method is based on excising a "worldtube" around the smaller object, much larger than the object itself, replacing it with an analytical model that approximates a tidally deformed black hole. Previously (arXiv:2304.05329) we have tested the idea in a toy model of a scalar charge in a fixed circular geodesic orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole, solving for the massless Klein-Gordon field in 3+1 dimensions on the SpECTRE platform. Here we take the significant further step of allowing the orbit to evolve radiatively, in a self-consistent manner, under the effect of back-reaction from the scalar field. We compute the inspiral orbit and the emitted scalar-field waveform, showing a good agreement with perturbative calculations in the adiabatic approximation. We also demonstrate how our simulations accurately resolve post-adiabatic effects (for which we do not have perturbative results). In this work we focus on quasi-circular inspirals. Our implementation will shortly be publicly accessible in the SpECTRE numerical relativity code.</description>

      <title>Hexadecapole at the heart of nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical Maxwell's electromagnetism, monopole term of the electric field is proportional to $r^{-2}$, while higher order multipole terms, sourced by anisotropic sources, fall-off faster. However, in nonlinear electromagnetism even a spherically symmetric field has multipole-like contributions. We prove that the leading subdominant term of the electric field, defined by nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian obeying Maxwellian weak field limit, in a static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat spacetime, is of the order $O(r^{-6})$ as $r \to \infty$. Moreover, using Lagrange inversion theorem and Fa\`a di Bruno's formula, we derive the series expansion of the electric field from the Taylor series of an analytic electromagnetic Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Generic spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes with equilibrium throat at the innermost photonsphere are unstable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we prove analytically that a generic spherically symmetric thin-shell wormhole (TSW) with its throat located at the innermost photonsphere of the bulk asymptotically flat black hole and supported by a generic surface barotropic perfect fluid is unstable against a radial linear perturbation. This is the generalization of the instability of the Schwarzschild TSW (STSW) with the throat's radius located at $a_{0}=3M$ that was revealed by Poisson and Visser in their seminal work \cite{Poisson1995} where they studied the mechanical stability of STSW. Our proof provides a link between the instability of the null circular geodesics on the innermost photonsphere of a generic static spherically symmetric asymptotically black hole and the TSW constructed in the same bulk with $a_{0}=r_{c}$ where $% a_{0} $ and $r_{c}$ are the radius of the TSW and the innermost photonsphere, respectively. For asymptotically flat spherically symmetric black holes possessing more than one photonspheres, the number of the photonspheres is odd and at least one photonsphere is stable which implies the corresponding TSW with its throat identical with the stable photonsphere is also stable.</description>

      <title>Effect of Deviations from General Relativity on Searches for Gravitational Wave Microlensing and Type II Strong Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the gravitational wave detector network is upgraded and the sensitivity of the detectors improves, novel scientific avenues open for exploration. For example, tests of general relativity will become more accurate as smaller deviations can be probed. Additionally, the detection of lensed gravitational waves becomes more likely. However, these new avenues could also interact with each other, and a gravitational wave event presenting deviations from general relativity could be mistaken for a lensed one. Here, we explore how phenomenological deviations from general relativity or binaries of exotic compact objects could impact those lensing searches focusing on a single event. We consider strong lensing, millilensing, and microlensing and find that certain phenomenological deviations from general relativity may be mistaken for all of these types of lensing. Therefore, our study shows that future candidate lensing events would need to be carefully examined to avoid a false claim of lensing where instead a deviation from general relativity has been seen.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics in generalized Proca theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermodynamics of static and spherically symmetric black holes (BHs) in generalized Proca (GP) theories by applying the Iyer-Wald prescription. BH solutions in GP theories are divided into the two classes. The first class corresponds to the solutions obtained by the direct promotion of the BH solutions in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories, while the second class consists of the solutions which are obtained only in GP theories and contain a nonzero electromagnetic field. For BH solutions in the first class, we confirm that the BH entropy and its thermodynamic mass remain the same as those in the counterpart solution in shift-symmetric Horndeski theories. We also calculate the thermodynamical variables of the several static and spherically-symmetric BH solutions in the second class, and investigate the thermodynamical stability when there exist two BH solutions.</description>

      <title>Condensate-Induced Inflation from Primordial Gravitational Waves in String-Inspired Chern-Simons Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a cosmological model of inflation that characterises Chern-Simons (CS) gravity models inspired from string theory. Such models are known to belong to the class of the so-called String-Inspired Running Vacuum Cosmologies. In particular, by applying methods of dynamical systems, commonly used in scalar-field cosmology, we examine in detail, for the first time, the passage from a pre-inflationary era dominated by a stiff-axion-matter equation of state, characteristic of the model, to inflation of Running Vacuum Model (RVM) type. By a careful discussion of the formation of the condensate of the CS gravitational anomaly term, induced by populations of primordial gravitational waves at the end of the stiff-axion-matter era, we show that an effectively linear axion-monodromy potential arises. This eventually causes the transition from the matter to the RVM inflation. By taking into account terms that have previously been ignored in the relevant literature of weak-graviton quantisation, we show that the effect of such terms is to diminish the value of the condensate by half, remaining however in the same order of magnitude. This, in turn, implies that the qualitative conclusions of previous works on the subject remain valid. Moreover, on assuming the approximate cosmic-time independence of the gravitational-CS condensate, we also provide an estimate of the number of sources of the primordial gravitational waves, upon the requirement of respecting the transplanckian conjecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on the energy radiation rate and waveforms of the gravitational wave generated by coalescing spinless binary systems up to the third post-Minkowskian approximation in the effective one-body theory. To derive an analytical expansion of the null tetrad components of the gravitational perturbed Weyl tensor $\varPsi_{4}$ in the effective spacetime, we utilize the method proposed by Sasaki $et$ $al.$ During this investigation, we discover more general integral formulas that provide a theoretical framework for computing the results in any order. Subsequently, we successfully compute the energy radiation rate and waveforms of the gravitational wave, which include the results of the Schwarzschild case and the correction terms resulting from the dimensionless parameters $a_{2}$ and $a_{3}$ in the effective metric.</description>

      <title>Spinfoam Models for Quantum Gravity: Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest of a physical theory of quantum gravity, spin foam models, or in short spinfoams, propose a well-defined path integral summing over quantized discrete space-time geometries. At the crossroad of topological quantum field theory, dynamical triangulations, Regge calculus, and loop quantum gravity, this framework provides a non-perturbative and background independent quantization of general relativity. It defines transition amplitudes between quantum states of geometry, and gives a precise picture of the Planck scale geometry with quantized areas and volumes. Gravity in three space-time dimensions is exactly quantized in terms of the Ponzano-Regge state-sum and Turaev-Viro topological invariants. In four space-time dimensions, gravity is formulated as a topological theory, of the BF type, with extra constraints, and hence quantized as a topological state-sum filled with defects. This leads to the Engle-Pereira-Rovelli-Livine (EPRL) spinfoam model, that can be used for explicit quantum gravity computations, for example for resolving the Big Bang singularity by a bounce or in black-to-white hole transition probability amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves in Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the four-dimensional effective field theory arising from heterotic string theory is general relativity with both a Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet term. We study the propagation of gravitational waves in this combination of Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, both of which have an associated scalar field, the axion and the dilaton respectively, that are kinetically coupled. We review how the combination of dynamical Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravities can arise from string theory as corrections to general relativity and show how the gravitational wave waveform is modified in such a theory. We compare our results to a novel framework recently introduced for parametrizing the parity-violating sector (Chern-Simons), and use that to guide our construction of a similar parametrization for the parity-conserving (Gauss-Bonnet) sector. In general, we find that the contributions from the parity-violating and parity-conserving sectors are similar. Moreover, the kinetic coupling between the axion and dilaton introduces an extra contribution to the parity-violating sector of the gravitational waves. Using our parametrization, we are able to comment on initial constraints for the theory parameters, including the time variations of the axion and dilaton.</description>

      <title>Imaging a semi-classical horizonless compact object with strong redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in black hole imaging have opened a new era of probing horizon-scale physics with electromagnetic radiation. However, a feature of the observed images, a bright ring encircling a relatively dark region, has not sufficiently proved the existence of event horizons. It thus requires extreme care when studying the possibility of using such image features to examine quantum effects that may change the classical picture of black holes slightly or drastically. In this work, we investigate the image of a horizonless compact object, whose interior metric satisfies the 4D semi-classical Einstein equation non-perturbatively for the Planck constant, and whose entropy agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Although the absence of an event horizon allows light rays to pass through the dense interior, the extremely strong redshift significantly darkens the image, making it almost identical to the classical black-hole image. In particular, if there is light emission a bit inside the surface of the object, the intensity around the inner shadow is slightly enhanced, which could be a future observable prediction to characterize the object. We also find through a phenomenological parameter that the image is further darkened due to interactions inside. Thus, the image is consistent with current observations, and the object could be a candidate for black holes in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from glitch-induced f-mode oscillations in quark and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter in compact stars is dense enough that transient events within the star could have sufficiently high energies to produce detectable gravitational waves (GWs). These GWs could be used to constrain the equation of state (EoS) for matter in the star and could reveal that there is more than one type of EoS at play in the population, implying that multiple types of compact stars exist. One of these types could be quark stars, composed almost entirely of stable quark matter, and observing GWs is a way to test for the strange matter EoS. Here we explore the possibility that, if fundamental (f-) mode oscillations in pulsars are induced by a pulsar glitch, then these oscillations might produce detectable GWs. We use the existing population of pulsars and their glitches, as well as a much larger synthesized population, along with 15 EoSs (8 for neutron stars and 7 for quark stars) to generate frequencies, damping times, and GW strengths for each. We find that of the EoSs examined, all quark star EoSs produce narrower distributions of f-mode frequency than neutron star EoSs. This result, along with other elements of the data, could be used to differentiate between GWs (or other signals from f-modes) originating from neutron stars and quark stars and thus could confirm the existence of quark stars. We also find that GW astronomy is a potentially viable method for detecting a larger population of pulsars which are not observable electromagnetically and that future GW observatories have the possibility to greatly expand this capability.</description>

      <title>Hotspots and Photon Rings in Schwarzschild Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future black hole (BH) imaging observations with better sensitivity and angular resolution are expected to resolve finer features corresponding to higher-order images of both hotspots that are produced in the accretion flow, as well as of the entire emitting region. In spherically symmetric spacetimes, the image order is determined by the maximum number of half-loops executed around the BH by the photons that form it. Due to the additional half-loop, consecutive-order images arrive after a delay time of approximately $\pi$ times the BH shadow radius. Furthermore, the deviation of the diameters from that of the shadow, widths, and flux-densities of consecutive-order images are exponentially demagnified by the lensing Lyapunov exponent, a characteristic of the spacetime. We compare the exact time delay between the appearance of the zeroth and first-order images of a hotspot to our best analytic estimate and find an error $\lesssim 50\%$ for hotspot locations within $\approx 10M$ from a Schwarzschild BH of mass $M$. We also explore the possibilities for inferring kinetic properties of hotspots, and also our inclination, from future BH movies. Furthermore, since the targets of such observations host geometrically-thick accretion flows (also jets), we obtain simple theoretical estimates of the variation in the diameters and widths of their first-order images, for varying disk scale-heights. We find realistically that the deviation of the former from that of the shadow is $\lesssim 30\%$ and that the latter remain $\lesssim 1.3M$. Finally, we estimate the error in recovering the lensing exponent, when using the first and second-order images, to be $\lesssim 20\%$. This provides further evidence that future observations could yield new and independent estimates of the shadow size and, in principle, of the lensing exponent, allowing us to robustly learn about the spacetimes of astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>Collapsar disk outflows I: Viscous hydrodynamic evolution in axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate mass ejection from accretion disks formed during the collapse of rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet stars. The neutrino-cooled, black hole (BH) accretion disk system that forms at the center of the star -- and the ensuing outflows -- provide the conditions for these systems to be candidate $r$-process element production sites and potential progenitors of broad-lined Type Ic (Ic-BL) supernovae. Here we present global, long-term axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of collapsar disks that include angular momentum transport through shear viscosity, neutrino emission and absorption, a 19-isotope nuclear reaction network and nuclear statistical equilibrium solver, a pseudo-Newtonian BH with mass and spin modified by accreted matter, and self-gravity. Starting from a stellar profile collapsed in spherical symmetry, our models capture disk formation self-consistently, and are evolved until after the shock wave -- driven by disk winds -- reaches the surface of the star. None of our models achieve sufficient neutronization to eject significant amounts of $r$-process elements (detailed nucleosynthesis calculations will follow in a companion paper). Sufficient $^{56}$Ni is produced to power a typical type Ic-BL supernova light curve, but the average asymptotic velocity is a factor $\sim 2-3$ times too slow to account for the typical line widths in type Ic-BL supernova spectra. The gap in neutrino emission between BH formation and shocked disk formation, and the magnitude of the subsequent peak in emission, would be observable diagnostics of the internal conditions of the progenitor in a galactic collapsar. Periodic oscillations of the shocked disk prior to its expansion are also a potential observable through their impact on the the neutrino and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a candidate Compton amplitude which is valid for any (integer) quantum spin and free from any spurious poles. We consider the cases of electromagnetism and gravity. We obtain such amplitudes by calculating the corresponding ones from superstring theory involving states on the leading Regge trajectory. To extract the associated field-theory amplitudes a few considerations in the form of simple physical constraints are required, such as: Soft momentum transfer, compactification of polarizations and consistent factorization in the physical channels. We believe the present exploration will be significantly relevant for the physics of compact binary systems with spin.</description>

      <title>Constraining Self-interacting Scalar Field Dark Matter From the Black Hole Shadow of the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exciting possibility to constrain dark matter (DM) scenarios is to search for their gravitational imprints on Black Hole (BH) observations. In this paper, we investigate the impact of self-interacting scalar field DM on the shadow radius of a Schwarzschild BH. We implement a self-consistent formulation, paying attention to the enhancement of the DM density due to the BH gravitational influence and the accretion flow onto the BH. First, we calculate the first-order correction to the shadow radius caused by a general DM environment. Then, we apply this perturbative method to the case of self-interacting scalar field DM and derive analytical expressions for the critical impact parameter. We find that self-consistency requirements, involving the lifetime and the mass of the central DM soliton, or the mass and the size of the extended virialized DM halo, ensure that the impact of the DM environment on the shadow radius is below the observational upper bound. This emphasizes the importance of taking into account the self-consistency constraints of the underlying DM scenario, which can strongly limit the range of possible DM density profiles and their impact on the shadow radius.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. On the other hand, in static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state exhibits KMS condition of infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the algebra formed by operators that are gravitationally dressed to the static patch observer. In the current work we study the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in double-scaled SYK model. We show that the algebra exhibits a behavior reminiscent of both perspectives. In particular, we prove that it's a Type II$_1$ factor, and the empty state with no chords satisfies the tracial property, thus aligning with the expectation in previous work. Furthermore, we show it's a cyclic separating state by exploring the modular structure of the algebra. We then study various limits of the theory and explore corresponding relations to JT gravity, theory of baby universe, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present a full solution to the energy spectrum of $0$- and $1$- particle irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>Effect of torsion in long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the effect of curved spacetime on neutrino oscillation. In a curved spacetime, the effect of curvature on fermionic fields is represented by spin connection. The spin connection consists of a non-universal ``contorsion" part which is expressed in terms of vector and axial current density of fermions. The contraction of contorsion part with the tetrad fields, which connects the internal flat space metric and the spacetime metric, is called torsion. In a scenario where neutrino travels through background of fermionic matter at ordinary densities in a curved spacetime, the Hamiltonian of neutrino oscillation gets modified by the torsional coupling constants $\lambda_{21}^{\prime}$ and $\lambda_{31}^{\prime}$. The aim of this work is to study the effect of $\lambda_{21}^{\prime}$ and $\lambda_{31}^{\prime}$ in DUNE and P2SO. In our study we, (i) discuss the effect of torsional coupling constants on the neutrino oscillation probabilities, (ii) estimate the capability of P2SO and DUNE to put bounds on these parameters and (iii) study how the physics sensitivities get modified in presence of torsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infrared problems of quantum electrodynamics, in contrast to ultraviolet difficulties which are of technical nature, are related to fundamental, conceptual physical questions, such as: what is a charged particle, is the particle interpretation of the electromagnetic field complete, does a vacuum state exist, or what is the quantum status of long range degrees of freedom. On the calculational level, the standard local formulations of quantum field theory have achieved procedures to deal with infinities related to long range correlations. However, the answers to the conceptual questions formulated above, based on the locality paradigm, do not seem to be fully convincing, which is confirmed by the fact that no canonical picture did emerge. This contribution briefly characterizes perspectives which open with an admission of nonlocal variables residing in infinity, or at the boundary of spacetime after compactification. Recently, this line of investigation gains popularity.</description>

Abstract: How to describe loop corrections is a fundamental challenge in the quantization of Einstein gravity. In this paper, we give it a try in UV-free scheme, and the result seems to be effective for graviton loops. This indicates that both loops of the renormalizable Standard Model and the non-renormalizable Einstein gravity can be described by the method of UV-free scheme.</description>

      <title>Testing MOND on small bodies in the remote solar system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which postulates a breakdown of Newton's laws of gravity/dynamics below some critical acceleration threshold, can explain many otherwise puzzling observational phenomena on galactic scales. MOND competes with the hypothesis of dark matter, which successfully explains the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure. Here we provide the first solar-system test of MOND that probes the sub-critical acceleration regime. Using the Bekenstein-Milgrom AQUAL formulation, we simulate the evolution of myriads of test particles (planetesimals or comets) born in the trans-Neptunian region and scattered by the giant planets over the lifetime of the Sun to heliocentric distances of $10^2$-$10^5$ au. We include the effects of the Galactic tidal field and passing stars. While Newtonian simulations reproduce the distribution of binding energies of long-period and Oort-cloud comets detectable from Earth, MOND-based simulations do not. This conclusion is robust to plausible changes in the migration history of the planets, the migration history of the Sun, the MOND transition function, effects of the Sun's birth cluster, and the fading properties of long-period comets. For the most popular version of AQUAL, characterized by a gradual transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes, our MOND-based simulations also fail to reproduce the orbital distribution of trans-Neptunian objects in the detached disk (perihelion &gt; 38 au). Our results do not rule out some MOND theories more elaborate than AQUAL, in which non-Newtonian effects are screened on small spatial scales, at small masses, or in external gravitational fields comparable in strength to the critical acceleration.</description>

      <title>How the non-metricity of the connection arises naturally in the classical theory of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spacetime geometry is described by two -- {\em a priori} independent -- geometric structures: the symmetric connection $\Gamma$ and the metric tensor $g$. Metricity condition of $\Gamma$ (i.e. $\nabla g = 0$) is implied by the Palatini variational principle, but only when the matter fields belong to an exceptional class. In case of a generic matter field, Palatini implies non-metricity of $\Gamma$. Traditionally, instead of the (1st order) Palatini principle, we use in this case the (2nd order) Hilbert principle, assuming metricity condition {\em a priori}. Unfortunately, the resulting right-hand side of the Einstein equations does not coincide with the matter energy-momentum tensor. We propose to treat seriously the Palatini-implied non-metric connection. The conventional Einstein's theory, rewritten in terms of this object, acquires a much simpler and universal structure. This approach opens a room for the description of the large scale effects in General Relativity (dark matter?, dark energy?), without resorting to purely phenomenological terms in the Lagrangian of gravitational field. All theories discussed in this paper belong to the standard General Relativity Theory, the only non-standard element being their (much simpler) mathematical formulation. As a mathematical bonus, we propose a new formalism in the calculus of variations, because in case of hyperbolic field theories the standard approach leads to nonsense conclusions.</description>

      <title>Photon ring autocorrelations from gravitational fluctuations around a black hole</title>

Abstract: The images of supermassive black holes in M87 and our galaxy captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) might open up a new way for exploring black hole physics at the horizon scale. Theoretically, this could provide insights into studying the emission sources around a black hole or the geometries of the black hole itself. This paper investigates the two-point correlations of intensity fluctuations on the photon ring, resulting from the existence of shock waves or gravitational fluctuations around a black hole. Following approaches used in the field of gravitational wave detectors, we introduce response functions of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) for detecting gravitational fluctuations and study the shape of the overlap reduction functions. It is found that the shape of the correlations here differs from that resulting from stochastic emission sources. By providing an order-of-magnitude estimate for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we obtain sensitivity curves for the detection of gravitational fluctuations. This might reveal the potential for detecting gravitational fluctuations with future VLBI observations in the LIGO frequency band.</description>

Abstract: Due to superradiant instabilities, clouds of ultralight bosons can spontaneously grow around rotating black holes, creating so-called "gravitational atoms". In this work, we study their dynamical effects on binary systems. We first focus on open orbits, showing that the presence of a cloud can increase the cross section for the dynamical capture of a compact object by more than an order of magnitude. We then consider closed orbits and demonstrate that the backreaction of the cloud's ionization on the orbital motion should be identified as dynamical friction. Finally, we study for the first time eccentric and inclined orbits. We find that, while ionization quickly circularizes the binary, it barely affects the inclination angle. These results enable a more realistic description of the dynamics of gravitational atoms in binaries and pave the way for dedicated searches with future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present several explicit reconstructions for {the aether scalar tensor (AeST) theory} derived from the background of Friedmann-Lema$\hat{\text{\i}}$tre-Robertson-Walker cosmological evolution. It is shown that the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with a positive cosmological constant is the only Lagrangian capable of accurately replicating the exact expansion history of the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe filled solely with dust-like matter. However, the $\Lambda$CDM-era can be produced within the framework of the AeST theory for some other fluids, including a perfect fluid with $p=-(1/3)\rho$, multifluids, and nonisentropic perfect fluids. Moreover, we demonstrate that the $\Lambda$CDM-era also can be replicated with no real matter field for the AeST theory. The cosmic evolution resulting from both the power-law and de-Sitter solutions also can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Influences of tilted thin accretion disks on the observational appearance of hairy black holes in Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on the observational appearance of black holes, both in general relativity and modified gravity, has been in full swing since the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration announced photos of M87$^{*}$ and Sagittarius A$^{*}$. Nevertheless, limited attention has been given to the impact of tilted accretion disks on black hole images. This paper investigates the $230$ GHz images of non-rotating hairy black holes illuminated by tilted, thin accretion disks in Horndeski gravity with the aid of a ray tracing method. The results indicate that reducing the scalar hair parameter effectively diminishes image luminosity and extends both the critical curve and the inner shadow. This trend facilitates the differentiation between hairy black holes and Schwarzschild black holes, especially in certain parameter spaces where the current Event Horizon Telescope array is capable of capturing such variations. Furthermore, we observe that the inclination of the tilted accretion disk can mimic the observation angle, consequently affecting image brightness and the morphology of the inner shadow. In specific parameter spaces, alterations in the tilt or position of the accretion disk can lead to a drift in the light spot within the images of hairy black holes. This finding may establish a potential correlation between the precession of the tilted accretion disk and image features. Additionally, through an examination of images depicting hairy black holes surrounded by two thin accretion disks, we report the obscuring effect of the accretion environment on the inner shadow of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of ``dynamical gravastars'', constructed by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with relativistic matter, undergoing a phase transition at high pressure to a state with negative energy density, as allowed in quantum theory. Since generation of a horizon-like structure or ``simulated horizon'' occurs at a radius above where the phase transition occurs, it is solely a property of the TOV equation with relativistic matter, for appropriate small radius initial conditions. We survey the formation of a simulated horizon from this point of view. From the numerical solutions, we show that the metric exponent appearing in the TOV equation undergoes an arc tangent-like jump, leading to formation of the simulated horizon. Rescaling the problem to fixed initial radius, we plot the ``phase diagram'' in the initial pressure--initial mass plane, showing the range of parameters where a simulated horizon dynamically forms. Finally, to facilitate further analysis we reformulate the TOV equations in rescaling invariant form .</description>

      <title>Quasi-local masses and cosmological coupling of black holes and mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent heated debate on whether the masses of local objects, such as compact stars or black holes (BHs), may be affected by the large-scale, cosmological dynamics, we analyze the conditions under which, in a general relativity framework, such a coupling small/large scales is allowed. We shed light on some controversial arguments, which have been used to rule out the latter possibility. We find that the cosmological coupling occurs whenever the energy of the central objects is quantified by the quasi-local Misner-Sharp mass (MS). Conversely, the decoupling occurs whenever the MS mass is fully equivalent to the (nonlocal) Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass. Consequently, for singular BHs embedded in cosmological backgrounds, like the Schwarzschild-de Sitter or McVittie solutions, we show that there is no cosmological coupling, confirming previous results in the literature. Furthermore, we show that nonsingular compact objects couple to the cosmological background, as quantified by their MS mass. We conclude that observational evidence of cosmological coupling of astrophysical BHs would be the smoking gun of their nonsingular nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the possibility of gravitationally induced matter creation in the so-called Energy-Momentum-Squared gravity (EMSG), i.e. $f(R,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity, in its dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor representation. Given the explicit nonminimal coupling between matter and geometry in this theory, the energy-momentum tensor is not generally covariantly conserved, which motivates the study of cosmological scenarios by resorting to the formalism of irreversible thermodynamics of open systems. We start by deriving the universe matter creation rates and subsequent thermodynamical properties, such as, the creation pressure, temperature evolution, and entropy evolution, in the framework of $f(R,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity. These quantities are then analyzed for a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background with a scale factor described by the de Sitter solution, under different assumptions for the mater distribution, namely a vacuum universe, a constant density universe, and a time-varying density universe. Finally, we explore cosmological solutions with varying Hubble parameters and provide a comparison with the standard cosmological model. Our results indicate that the cosmological evolution in the framework of EMSG are in close agreement with the observational cosmological data for low redshift.</description>

By simple geometrical arguments, we found that the mass/energy formula is satisfied by two meaningful extremal black holes where mass (m), charge (Q), and angular momentum/spin (L) are proportional to the black holes irreducible mass (m_{ir}) expressed by irrational numbers. These black holes have been studied in the Christodoulou diagram and their topology in E^3 has been investigated by differential geometry. We show that one of the analyzed Kerr-Newman black holes corresponds to the case where the Gaussian curvature becomes zero at the poles. in the first case, the coefficients are linked to irrational numbers. In the second extremal black hole examined, the fundamental quantities m, Q, and L are linked to the irreducible mass by coefficients that depend solely on the "golden ratio number" -\phi_-. In this case, we show that if this extremal black hole satisfies the Pythagorean fundamental forms relation at the umbilic points, then both the scale parameter (corresponding to twice the irreducible mass) and the Gauss curvature of the surface at the poles are equal to the golden ratio numbers. For these two extremal black holes, we calculate the energy extractible by reversible transformations finding that, in percentage, the energy extractable from the latter black hole is higher than the former one.</description>

      <title>Pathological Character of Modifications to Coincident General Relativity: Cosmological Strong Coupling and Ghosts in $f(\Q)$ Theories</title>

Abstract: The intrinsic presence of ghosts in the symmetric teleparallel framework is elucidated. We illustrate our general arguments in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ theories by studying perturbations in the three inequivalent spatially flat cosmologies. Two of these branches exhibit reduced linear spectra, signalling they are infinitely strongly coupled. For the remaining branch we unveil the presence of seven gravitational degrees of freedom and show that at least one of them is a ghost. Our results rule out $f(\mathbb{Q})$ cosmologies and clarify the number of propagating degrees of freedom in these theories.</description>

      <title>Calibrating signal-to-noise ratio detection thresholds using gravitational-wave catalogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for gravitational-wave signals is a challenging and computationally intensive endeavor undertaken by multiple independent analysis pipelines. While detection depends only on observed noisy data, it is sometimes inconsistently defined in terms of source parameters that in reality are unknown, e.g., by placing a threshold on the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We present a method to calibrate unphysical thresholds to search results by performing Bayesian inference on real observations using a model that simultaneously parametrizes the intrinsic network optimal SNR distribution and the effect of search sensitivity on it. We find consistency with a fourth-order power law and detection thresholds of $10.5_{-2.4}^{+2.1}$, $11.2_{-1.4}^{+1.2}$, and $9.1_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$ (medians and $90\%$ credible intervals) for events with false-alarm rates less than $1\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the first, second, and third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs, respectively. Though event selection can only be self-consistently reproduced by physical searches, employing our inferred thresholds allows approximate observation-calibrated selection criteria to be applied when efficiency is required and injection campaigns are infeasible.</description>

      <title>Efficient parameter inference for gravitational wave signals in the presence of transient noises using temporal and time-spectral fusion normalizing flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glitches represent a category of non-Gaussian and transient noise that frequently intersects with gravitational wave (GW) signals, exerting a notable impact on the processing of GW data. The inference of GW parameters, crucial for GW astronomy research, is particularly susceptible to such interference. In this study, we pioneer the utilization of temporal and time-spectral fusion normalizing flow for likelihood-free inference of GW parameters, seamlessly integrating the high temporal resolution of the time domain with the frequency separation characteristics of both time and frequency domains. Remarkably, our findings indicate that the accuracy of this inference method is comparable to traditional non-glitch sampling techniques. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater efficiency, boasting processing times on the order of milliseconds. In conclusion, the application of normalizing flow emerges as pivotal in handling GW signals affected by transient noises, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the field of GW astronomy research.</description>

      <title>Theoretically motivated dark electromagnetism as the origin of relativistic MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is a modest attempt to initiate the research program outlined in this abstract. We propose that general relativity and relativistic MOND (RelMOND) are analogues of the broken electroweak symmetry. That is, $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{YDEM} \rightarrow U(1)_{DEM}$ (DEM stands for dark electromagnetism), and GR is assumed to arise from the broken $SU(2)_R$ symmetry, and is analogous to the weak force. RelMOND is identified with dark electromagnetism $U(1)_{DEM}$, which is the remaining unbroken symmetry after spontaneous symmetry breaking of the darkelectro-grav sector $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{YDEM}$. This sector, as well as the electroweak sector, arise from the breaking of an $E_8 \times E_8$ symmetry, in a recently proposed model of unification of the standard model with pre-gravitation, this latter being an $SU(2)_R$ gauge theory. The source charge for the dark electromagnetic force is square-root of mass, motivated by the experimental fact that the square-roots of the masses of the electron, up quark, and down quark, are in the ratio 1:2:3, which is a flip of their electric charge ratios 3:2:1 The introduction of the dark electromagnetic force helps understand the weird mass ratios of the second and third generation of charged fermions. We also note that in the deep MOND regime, acceleration is proportional to square-root of mass, which motivates us to propose the relativistic $U(1)_{DEM}$ gauge symmetry as the origin of MOND. We explain why the dark electromagnetic force falls inversely with distance, as in MOND, and not as the inverse square of distance. We conclude that dark electromagnetism is a good mimicker of cold dark matter, and the two are essentially indistinguishable in those cosmological situations where CDM is successful in explaining observations, such as CMB anisotropies, and gravitational lensing.</description>

Abstract: It has been suggested in recent literature that non-linear and/or gravitomagnetic general relativistic effects can play a leading role in galactic dynamics, partially or totally replacing dark matter. Using the 1+3 "quasi-Maxwell" formalism, we show, on general grounds, such hypothesis to be impossible.</description>

Abstract: We herein investigate the universal relation proposed by Goon and Penco in de Sitter black holes with electric charge or angular momentum. Our analysis focuses on the cosmological horizon, which only exists in de Sitter and Nariai spacetimes. Because the relation is given in a general case, the overall relationship may be valid. However, we elucidate the details of the relation, highlighting distinctions from those of (anti-)de Sitter black holes while affirming the validity of the relation. Furthermore, based on our analysis of Schwarzschild--de Sitter, Reissner--Nordstr\"om--de Sitter, and Kerr--de Sitter black holes, we demonstrate the universality of the thermodynamic relation in de Sitter black holes.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Keplerian parametrization for eccentric compact binaries in scalar-tensor theories at second post-Newtonian order and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized post-Keplerian parametrization for compact binaries on eccentric bound orbits is established at second post-Newtonian (2PN) order in a class of massless scalar-tensor theories. This result is used to compute the orbit-averaged flux of energy and angular momentum at Newtonian order, which means relative 1PN order beyond the leading-order dipolar radiation of scalar-tensor theories. The secular evolution of the orbital elements is then computed at 1PN order. At leading order, the closed form "Peters &amp; Matthews" relation between the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$ is found to be independent of any scalar-tensor parameter, and is given by $a \propto e^{4/3}/(1-e^2)$. Finally, the waveform is obtained at Newtonian order in the form of a spherical harmonic mode decomposition, extending to eccentric orbits the results obtained in arXiv:2201.10924.</description>

      <title>Cosmic evolution of Kantowski-Sachs universe in the context of bulk viscous string in teleparallel gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we have analysed the Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model with teleparallel gravity, where a bulk viscous fluid containing one-dimensional cosmic strings serves as the source for the energy-momentum tensor. To obtain the deterministic solution of the field equations, we employed the proportionality condition linking the shear scalar ({\sigma}) and the expansion scalar ({\theta}), which establishes a relationship between metric potentials. Another approach employed was the utilisation of the Hybrid Expansion Law (HEL). The discussion focuses on the behaviour of the accelerating universe concerning the specific choice of a highly non-linear form of teleparallel gravity f(T) = {\alpha}T + \b{eta}T m, where T is the torsion scalar, {\alpha}, \b{eta} are model parameter and m is a positive integer. The equation of state parameter ({\omega}) in this model supports the acceleration behaviour of the universe. We observed that the null energy condition and weak energy condition are obeyed while violating the strong energy condition as per the present accelerating expansion. It has been observed that, under specific model parameter constraints, the universe transitions from a decelerating to an accelerated phase.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the process of an ultrarelativistic fluid accreted onto axisymmetric Kerr-Sen black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory. We obtain the solution describing the velocity potential of a stationary irrotational fluid with a stiff equation of state and the solution for the streamlined diagram of the quadrupolar flow. We also investigate how the solution's coefficients and the stagnation points are affected by the parameters. The injection rate, the ejection rate, and the critical angle are discussed in detail. We find that with an increasing dilaton parameter the ratio of the ejection rate to the injection rate increases and that the radiative efficiency is larger, while the redshift is lower, compared to the Kerr black hole.</description>

Abstract: Matrix configurations define noncommutative spaces endowed with extra structure including a generalized Laplace operator, and hence a metric structure. Made dynamical via matrix models, they describe rich physical systems including noncommutative gauge theory and emergent gravity. Refining the construction in [1], we construct a semi-classical limit through an immersed submanifold of complex projective space based on quasi-coherent states. We observe the phenomenon of oxidation, where the resulting semi-classical space acquires spurious extra dimensions. We propose to remove this artifact by passing to a leaf of a carefully chosen foliation, which allows to extract the geometrical content of the noncommutative spaces. This is demonstrated numerically via multiple examples.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical results from a parameter study of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI), investigating the impact of general relativity (GR) on the dynamics. Using GR hydrodynamics with GR gravity, and nonrelativistic (NR) hydrodynamics with Newtonian gravity, in an idealized model setting, we vary the initial radius of the shock and, by varying its mass and radius in concert, the proto-neutron star (PNS) compactness. We investigate four compactnesses expected in a post-bounce core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We find that GR leads to a longer SASI oscillation period, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as large as 1.29 for the highest-compactness suite. We also find that GR leads to a slower SASI growth rate, with ratios between the GR and NR cases as low as 0.47 for the highest-compactness suite. We discuss implications of our results for CCSN simulations.</description>

      <title>Formation of Merging Stellar-Mass Black Hole Binaries by Gravitational Wave Emission in Active Galactic Nucleus Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many stellar-mass Black Holes (sBHs) are expected to orbit supermassive black holes at galactic centers. For galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), it is likely that the sBHs reside in a disk. We study the formation of sBH binaries via gravitational wave emission in such disks. We examine analytically the dynamics of two sBHs orbiting a supermassive black hole, estimate the capture cross section, and derive the eccentricity distribution of bound binaries at different frequency bands. We find that the majority of the merging sBH binaries, assembled in this manner, can be measured as highly eccentric, detectable in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band from their formation, with $(1-e)\ll1$, through their circularization and up to their merger; the remaining binaries circularize to small eccentricities ($e\lesssim0.3$) before entering the LVK band. More eccentric mergers would be observed for sBHs with higher random velocities, closer to the supermassive black hole, or at lower observing frequency bands, as planned in future gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA.</description>

      <title>New limits on the local Lorentz invariance violation of gravity in the Standard-Model Extension with pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz Violation (LV) is posited as a possible relic effect of quantum gravity at low energy scales. The Standard-Model Extension provides an effective field-theoretic framework for examining possible deviations attributed to LV. With their high observational accuracy, pulsars serve as ideal laboratories for probing LV. In the presence of LV, both the spin precession of solitary pulsars and orbital dynamics of binary pulsars would undergo modifications. Observations of pulse profiles and times of arrival (TOAs) of pulses allow for an in-depth investigation of these effects, leading to the establishment of strict limits on LV coefficients. We revisit the project of limiting local LV with updated pulsar observations. We employ a new parameter estimation method and utilize state-of-the-art pulsar timing observation data and get new limits on 8 linear combinations of LV coefficients based on 25 tests from 12 different systems. Compared to previous limits from pulsars, precision has improved by a factor of two to three. Additionally, we explore prospects for further improvements from pulsars. Simulation results indicate that more observations of spin precession in solitary millisecond pulsars could significantly enhance the accuracy of spatial LV coefficients, potentially by three to four orders of magnitude. As observational data accumulate, pulsars are anticipated to increasingly contribute to the tests of LV.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave imprints of non-convex dynamics in binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explaining gravitational-wave (GW) observations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers requires an understanding of matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Our current knowledge of the properties of high-density matter relies on electromagnetic and GW observations, nuclear physics experiments, and general relativistic numerical simulations. In this paper we perform numerical-relativity simulations of BNS mergers subject to non-convex dynamics, allowing for the appearance of expansive shock waves and compressive rarefactions. Using a phenomenological non-convex equation of state we identify observable imprints on the GW spectra of the remnant. In particular, we find that non-convexity induces a significant shift in the quasi-universal relation between the peak frequency of the dominant mode and the tidal deformability (of order $\Delta f_{\rm peak}\gtrsim 380\,\rm Hz$) with respect to that of binaries with convex (regular) dynamics. Similar shifts have been reported in the literature, attributed however to first-order phase transitions from nuclear/hadronic matter to deconfined quark matter. We argue that the ultimate origin of the frequency shifts is to be found in the presence of anomalous, non-convex dynamics in the binary remnant.</description>

We construct the most general solution of the GWs in the presence of a causal, timelike, or null boundary when the usual tensor modes are turned off. Our solution space besides the shape and topology of the wavefront which is a generic compact, smooth, and orientable $2d$ surface $\Sigma$, is specified by a vector over $\Sigma$ satisfying the conformal Killing equation and two scalars that are arbitrary functions over the causal boundary, the boundary modes (soft hair). We work out the symplectic form over the solution space using covariant phase space formalism and analyze the boundary symmetries and charges. The algebra of surface charges is a Heisenberg algebra. Only the overall size of the compact wavefront and not the details of its shape appears in the boundary symplectic form and is canonical conjugate to the overall mass of the GW. Hence, the information about the shape of the wavefront can't be probed by the boundary observer. We construct a boundary energy-momentum tensor and a boundary current, whose conservation yields the RT equation for both asymptotically AdS and flat spacetimes. The latter provides a hydrodynamic description for our RT solutions.</description>

Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars on the equatorial plane orbiting Kerr black holes have been widely studied. However thus far, there have been fewer studies of stars in inclined precessing orbits around a Kerr black hole. In this paper, we use the tensor virial equations to show the presence of possible resonances in these systems for typical physical parameters of black hole-neutron star binaries in close orbits or of a white dwarf/an ordinary star orbiting a supermassive black hole. This suggests the presence of a new instability before the tidal disruption limit is encountered in such systems.</description>
