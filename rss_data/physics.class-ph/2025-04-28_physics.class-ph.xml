      <title>Higher-order topological corner states and edge states in grid-like frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum grid-like frames composed of rigidly jointed beams, wherein bending is the predominant deformation mode, are classic subjects of study in the field of structural mechanics. However, their topological dynamical properties have only recently been revealed. As the structural complexity of the frame increases along with the number of beam members arranged in the two-dimensional plane, the vibration modes also increase significantly in number, with frequency ranges of topological states and bulk states overlapped, leading to hybrid mode shapes. Therefore, concise theoretical results are necessary to guide the identification of topological modes in such planar continuum systems with complex spectra. In this work, within an infinitely long frequency spectrum, we obtain analytical expressions for the frequencies of higher-order topological corner states, edge states, and bulk states in kagome frames and square frames, as well as the criteria of existence of these topological states and patterns of their distribution in the spectrum. Additionally, we present the frequency expressions and the existence criterion for topological edge states in quasi-one-dimensional structures such as bridge-like frames, along with an approach to determine the existence of topological edge states based on bulk topological invariants. These theoretical results fully demonstrate that the grid-like frames, despite being a large class of continuum systems with complex spectra, have topological states (including higher-order topological states) that can be accurately characterized through concise analytical expressions. This work contributes to an excellent platform for the study of topological mechanics, and the accurate and concise theoretical results facilitate direct applications of topological grid-like frame structures in industry and engineering.</description>

      <title>Increasing dynamic range of NESs by using geometric nonlinear damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with the passive control of resonant systems using nonlinear energy sink (NES). The objective is to highlight the benefits of adding nonlinear geometrical damping in addition to the cubic stiffness nonlinearity. The behaviour of the system is investigated theoretically by using the mixed harmonic balance multiple scales method. Based on the obtained slow flow equations, a design procedure that maximizes the dynamic range of the NES is presented. Singularity theory is used to express conditions for the birth of detached resonance cure independently of the forcing frequency. It is shown that the presence of a detached resonance curve is not necessarily detrimental to the performance of the NES. Moreover, the detached resonance curve can be completely suppressed by adding nonlinear damping. The results of the design procedure are then compared to numerical simulations.</description>
