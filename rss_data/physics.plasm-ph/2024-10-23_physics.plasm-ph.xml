      <title>Three-Dimensional Particle-In-Cell Simulations of Two-Dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present three-dimensional (3D) Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study the stability of 2D Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in a magnetized plasma with a finite background magnetic field. The simulations were performed using the Plasma Simulation Code (PSC) [Germaschewski et al., J. of Comp. Phys. 318, 305 (2016)], as in our recent study using 2D PIC simulations [McClung et al., Phys. Plasmas 31, 042302 (2024)], in order to see if and how the previous results would change with 3D effects. We found that solutions that are stable (unstable) in 2D simulations are still stable (unstable) in the new 3D simulations. However, the instability develops slower in 3D than in 2D and forms an unstable spiral wave structure that is in-phase along the axial direction. We have also simulated cases with an electron density bump (EDB) at the center, in addition to cases with an electron density hole (EDH) considered in our previous study, and found differences in the unstable spiral wave structures between the two cases. Additionally, we have generalized our simulations to have an increased electron thermal velocity, as well as using initial conditions solved from the complete Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations. We found that these generalizations did not change the overall behavior of the simulations and the instability that evolves.</description>

      <title>Surface Modifications of PCB-Based Plasma Sources Induced by Atmospheric Plasma: A Comparative Study of Dielectric and Electrode Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigated the effects of atmospheric plasma on various dielectric materials (FR-4, PTFE, Al$_2$O$_3$) and electrode materials (copper, silver, gold-plated copper) used in surface micro-discharge plasma sources. XPS and laser microscopy were used to analyze changes in surface properties and chemical composition after 10 hours of plasma exposure. Al$_2$O$_3$ showed the highest resistance, with no significant changes in Al/O ratio or oxidation state. PTFE underwent oxidation, with fluorine substituted by oxygen, forming carbonyl, hydroxyl and aldehyde groups. FR-4 showed the most substantial changes, with etching of the epoxy matrix exposing glass fibers. This was in line with the XPS results, which show a higher O/C-ratio, less epoxy groups and higher nitrogen signals. Silver electrodes were most resilient, with sintered particles redistributed across the Al$_2$O$_3$ surface. Copper and gold-plated copper electrodes were more susceptible to oxidation and degradation, especially in areas exposed to plasma filaments. The results highlight the importance of carefully selecting materials based on resistance to plasma exposure and compatibility with the application.</description>

      <title>Measurements of power dissipated in an atmospheric pressure plasma jet device with double plasma discharge ignition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are versatile devices with numerous applications. This work focuses on APPJs generated at the tip of long, flexible tubes using the jet transfer technique. The plasma source consists of a primary discharge and a secondary discharge forming the plasma jet. Discharge power measurements were carried out in a way that it was possible to separate the contribution of the primary discharge from the total power dissipated by the plasma source. Both power and effective current were analyzed under different operating conditions. The results show that the variation of the primary discharge power is much lower than the power dissipated by the plasma jet. Additionally, the electrical characteristics of the plasma device were analyzed. Notable differences were observed between the negative and positive phases of the discharge, with a more resistive load in the negative one, which suggests that the electrical equivalent circuit model changes according to the voltage polarity.</description>

      <title>DEGAS 2 model validation study: comparison of measured and modeled helium and deuterium line emission arising from an external gas puff on Alcator C-Mod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to accurately model and predict neutral transport in the boundary plasma is important for tokamak operation. Nevertheless, validation of neutral transport models can be challenging due to the difficulty in measuring neutral particle distributions. Taking advantage of the localized neutral gas puff associated with the Gas Puff Imaging (GPI) diagnostic on the Alcator C-Mod, a validation study of the neutral transport code DEGAS 2 has been performed for helium and deuterium neutrals. Absolutely calibrated measurements of helium and hydrogen line emission are compared with simulated emission from DEGAS 2, accounting for the measured gas flow rates and employing a realistic geometry. Good agreement in peak brightness and profile shape is found for a deuterium puff case. However, helium line emission measurements are found to be lower by a factor of three than that predicted in the steady state DEGAS 2 simulations for a wide range in plasma density. Discrepancies in the light emission profile shape are evident as well. As possible causes for this discrepancy, two effects are discussed. First is the effect of local cooling due to gas puff. Second is the role of time-dependent turbulence effects on neutral penetration.</description>

      <title>Does the oscillatory behavior of the Momentum Spectrum depend on the basis in the Post-Transient Stage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair creation by a spatially homogeneous, time-dependent electric field is studied within the framework of scalar quantum electrodynamics. We employ the standard Bogoliubov transformation approach to compute the single-particle distribution function in an adiabatic basis. We analyzed the distribution function of created particles in two different adiabatic bases (related by a unitary transformation). A novel dynamical scaling is observed while analyzing the oscillatory momentum spectrum of the pairs created by the Sauter pulsed field at intermediate times, calculated using the two adiabatic bases. In these bases, the same oscillatory momentum spectra are observed but at different times. However, when we scale the time by the point marking the end of the transient stage of dynamical evolution for each case of central momentum, the respective momentum spectra overlap. Furthermore, we study the time evolution of the momentum spectrum in the multi-photon regime and find that the spectra show a multi-modal profile structure at finite times for both choices of basis.</description>

      <title>Exact local conservation of energy in fully implicit PIC algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the issue of strict, fully discrete \emph{local} energy conservation for a whole class of fully implicit local-charge- and global-energy-conserving particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithms. Earlier studies demonstrated these algorithms feature strict global energy conservation. However, whether a local energy conservation theorem exists (in which the local energy update is governed by a flux balance equation at every mesh cell) for these schemes is unclear. In this study, we show that a local energy conservation theorem indeed exists. We begin our analysis with the 1D electrostatic PIC model without orbit-averaging, and then generalize our conclusions to account for orbit averaging, multiple dimensions, and electromagnetic models (Darwin). In all cases, a temporally, spatially, and particle-discrete local energy conservation theorem is shown to exist, proving that these formulations (as originally proposed in the literature), in addition to being locally charge conserving, are strictly locally energy conserving as well. In contrast to earlier proofs of local conservation in the literature \citep{xiao2017local}, which only considered continuum time, our result is valid for the fully implicit time-discrete version of all models, including important features such as orbit averaging. We demonstrate the local-energy-conservation property numerically with a paradigmatic numerical example.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection-driven energization of protons up to 400 keV at the near-Sun heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report observations of direct evidence of energetic protons being accelerated above ~400 keV within the reconnection exhaust of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at a distance of ~16.25 solar radii (Rs) from the Sun. Inside the extended exhaust, both the reconnection-generated plasma jets and the accelerated protons propagated toward the Sun, unambiguously establishing their origin from HCS reconnection sites located beyond PSP. Within the core of the exhaust, PSP detected stably trapped energetic protons up to ~400 keV, which is approximately 1000 times greater than the available magnetic energy per particle. The differential energy spectrum of the accelerated protons behaved as a pure power-law with spectral index of about -5. Supporting simulations using the kglobal model suggest that the trapping and acceleration of protons up to ~400 keV in the reconnection exhaust is likely facilitated by merging magnetic islands with a guide field between ~0.2-0.3 of the reconnecting magnetic field, consistent with the observations. These new results, enabled by PSP's proximity to the Sun, demonstrate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is a significant new source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind. The discovery of in-situ particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection at the HCS provides valuable insights into this fundamental process which frequently converts the large magnetic field energy density in the near-Sun plasma environment and may be responsible for heating the sun's atmosphere, accelerating the solar wind, and energizing charged particles to extremely high energies in solar flares.</description>

      <title>Continuous relativistic high-harmonic generation from a kHz liquid-sheet plasma mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on continuous high-harmonic generation at 1 kHz repetition rate from a liquid-sheet plasma mirror driven by relativistic-intensity near-single-cycle light transients. Through precise control of both the surface plasma density gradient and the driving light waveform, we can produce highly stable and reproducible extreme ultraviolet spectral quasi-continua, corresponding to the generation of stable kHz-trains of isolated attosecond pulses in the time domain. This confirms the exciting potential of liquid sheet targets as one of the building blocks of future high-power attosecond lasers.</description>

      <title>On the Acceleration of the Young Solar Wind from Different Source Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The acceleration of the young solar wind is studied using the first 17 encounters of Parker Solar Probe. We identify wind intervals from different source regions: coronal hole (CH) interiors, streamers, and low Mach number boundary layers (LMBLs), i.e. the inner boundaries of coronal holes. We present their statistical trends in the acceleration process. Most of the observations can be reproduced by a two-fluid hydrodynamic model with realistic corona temperatures. In such a model, the solar wind is accelerated by the combined thermal pressures of protons and electrons,but it is mainly the difference in the proton pressure that leads to the difference in the solar wind speed. The proton pressure is the highest in the fastest CH wind, with a high initial proton temperature that decreases slowly. It is lower in the relatively slow LMBL wind, and the lowest in the slowest streamer wind. The proton temperature is quadratically correlated with the wind speed when scaled to the same distance. In contrast, the electron temperature shows no significant differences for different wind types or wind speeds, indicating more similar contributions from the electron pressure. The model gives reasonable locations for the sonic critical point, which is on average at 3.6-7.3 solar radii and can also extend to large distances when the proton temperature is extremely low, as in the LMBL wind. In addition to the thermal pressure, we raise the possibility that Alfv\'en waves may contribute to the solar wind acceleration, especially for the fast CH wind.</description>
