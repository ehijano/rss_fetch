      <title>On some examples of identifying Painlev\'e equations using the geometry of the Okamoto space of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note we give two examples of using the algebro-geometric theory of Painlev\'e equations to solve the Painlev\'e identification problem. The equations that we consider were recently obtained by M. van der Put and J. Top in their study of a certain ansatz of isomonodromic deformations of linear ODEs. We provide explicit coordinate transformations identifying these examples with standard form of some Painlev\'e equations and also explicitly identify their Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Polynomials for the Gaussian Weight with a Jump and Discrete Painlev\'e Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a refined version of the discrete Painlev\'e identification problem that emphasizes the importance on going beyond just the surface type in describing a discrete Painlev\'e dynamic. We give an example of solving such identification problem for a particular recurrence relation that previously appeared in studying orthogonal polynomials for the Gaussian weight with a single jump.</description>

      <title>Classical r-matrix structure for elliptic Ruijsenaars chain and 1+1 field analogue of Ruijsenaars-Schneider model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical dynamical $r$-matrix structure for the periodic elliptic Ruijsenaars chain is described. The Poisson brackets for the monodromy matrix are calculated as well, thus providing Liouville integrability of the model. Next, we study its continuous non-relativistic limit and reproduce the Maillet type non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structure for the field analogue of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model.</description>

      <title>Form factors of composite branch-point twist operators in the sinh-Gordon model on a multi-sheeted Riemann surface: semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sinh-Gordon model in 1+1 dimensions is one of the simplest and best-studied massive integrable relativistic quantum field theories. We consider this theory on a multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces with a flat metric, which can be seen as a pile of planes connected to each other along cut lines. The cut lines end at branch points, which are represented by a twist operator ${\cal T}_n.$ Operators of such kind are interesting in the framework of the problem of computing von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies in the original model on the plane. The composite branch-point twist operators (CTO) are a natural generalization of the twist operators, obtained by placing a local operator to a branch point by means of a certain limiting procedure.
  Correlation function in quantum field theory can be, in principle, found by means of the spectral decomposition. It allows one to express them in terms of form factors of local operators, i.e. their matrix elements in the basis of stationary states. In integrable models complete sets of exact form factors of all operators can be found exactly as solutions of a system of bootstrap equations. Nevertheless, identification of these solution to the operators in terms of the basic fields remains problematic. In this work, we develop a technique of computing form factors of a class of CTO determined in terms of the basic field in the semiclassical approximation.</description>

      <title>Linearization of the box-ball system with box capacity L</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a bijection between the state of the box-ball system with box capacity L and a pair of two sequences. In time evolution, one of the sequences moves at speed 1, and the other follows the rules of the box-ball system with box capacity one, which can be linearized by the Kerov-Kirillov-Reshetikhin(KKR) bijection. Our method can be applied to a state including a negative value or a value greater than the box capacity.</description>

      <title>Confined and deconfined chaos in classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic, and thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are already unstable. Chaotic instabilities thus far precede thermalization. In a different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain (confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold. The latter leads to chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale, which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals.</description>
