      <title>Impact of current uncertainties in the 12C+12C nuclear reaction rate on intermediate-mass stars and massive white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent determinations of the total rate of the 12C+12C nuclear reaction show non-negligible differences with the reference reaction rate commonly used in previous stellar simulations. In addition, the current uncertainties in determining each exit channel constitute one of the main uncertainties in shaping the inner structure of super asymptotic giant branch stars that could have a measurable impact on the properties of pulsating ultra-massive white dwarfs (WDs). We explore how new determinations of the nuclear reaction rate and its branching ratios affect the evolution of WD progenitors. We show that the current uncertainties in the branching ratios constitute the main uncertainty factor in determining the inner composition of ultra-massive WDs and their progenitors. We found that the use of extreme branching ratios leads to differences in the central abundances of 20Ne of at most 17%, which are translated into differences of at most 1.3 and 0.8% in the cooling times and size of the crystallized core. However, the impact on the pulsation properties is small, less than 1 s for the asymptotic period spacing. We found that the carbon burns partially in the interior of ultra-massive WD progenitors within a particular range of masses, leaving a hybrid CONe-core composition in their cores. The evolution of these new kinds of predicted objects differs substantially from the evolution of objects with pure CO cores. Differences in the size of the crystallized core and cooling times of up to 15 and 6%, respectively leading to distinct patterns in the period spacing distribution.</description>

      <title>The FUV Spectrum of FU Ori South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eruptive YSO FU Ori is the eponym of its variable class. FU Ori stars are known to undergo outbursts with amplitudes of $&gt;4$ magnitudes in the $V$ band and durations of several decades. Interaction with a binary companion is one proposed outburst trigger, so understanding both components of the FU Ori system is crucial. A recent HST/STIS observation of the FU Ori system clearly resolves its North and South components. We report here on the spectrum of FU Ori South. We detect NUV continuum emission but no FUV continuum, although several bright emission lines consistent with those seen in T Tauri stars are present. The presence of the C II] 2325 multiplet and many H$_2$ lines indicate active accretion. We estimate the extinction to the source and find that the UV spectrum favors $A_V &lt; 4$, contrary to past estimates based on the NIR spectrum.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Proton Differential Flow of A Coronal Mass Ejection at 15 Solar Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alpha-proton differential flow ($V_{\alpha p}$) of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar wind from the Sun to 1 au and beyond could influence the instantaneous correspondence of absolute abundances of alpha particles (He$^{2+}$/H$^{+}$) between solar corona and interplanetary space as the abundance of a coronal source can vary with time. Previous studies based on Ulysses and Helios showed that $V_{\alpha p}$ is negligible within CMEs from 5 to 0.3 au, similar to slow solar wind ($&lt;$ 400 km s$^{-1}$). However, recent new observations using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) revealed that the $V_{\alpha p}$ of slow wind increases to $\sim$60 km s$^{-1}$ inside 0.1 au. It is significant to answer whether the $V_{\alpha p}$ of CMEs exhibits the similar behavior near the Sun. In this Letter, we report the $V_{\alpha p}$ of a CME measured by PSP at $\sim$15 $R_\odot$ for the first time, which demonstrates that the $V_{\alpha p}$ of CMEs is obvious and complex inside 0.1 au while keeps lower than the local Alfv\'{e}n speed. A very interesting point is that the same one CME duration can be divided into A and B intervals clearly with Coulomb number below and beyond 0.5, respectively. The means of $V_{\alpha p}$ and alpha-to-proton temperature ratios of interval A (B) is 96.52 (21.96) km s$^{-1}$ and 7.65 (2.23), respectively. This directly illustrates that Coulomb collisions play an important role in reducing the non-equilibrium features of CMEs. Our study indicates that the absolute elemental abundances of CMEs also might vary during their propagation.</description>

      <title>Stable Case BB/BC Mass Transfer to Form GW190425-like Massive Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On April 25th, 2019, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration discovered a Gravitational-wave (GW) signal from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, i.e., GW190425. Due to the inferred large total mass, the origin of GW190425 remains unclear. We perform detailed stellar structure and binary evolution calculations that take into account mass-loss, internal differential rotation, and tidal interactions between a He-rich star and a NS companion. We explore the parameter space of the initial binary properties, including initial NS and He-rich masses and initial orbital period. We find that the immediate post-common-envelope progenitor system, consisting of a primary $\sim2.0\,M_\odot$ ($\sim1.7\,M_\odot$) NS and a secondary He-rich star with an initial mass of $\sim3.0-5.5\,M_\odot$ ($\sim5.5-6.0\,M_\odot$) in a close binary with an initial period of $\sim0.08-0.5\,{\rm{days}}$ ($\sim 0.08-0.4\,{\rm{days}}$), that experiences stable Case BB/BC mass transfer (MT) during binary evolution, can reproduce the formation of GW190425-like BNS events. Our studies reveal that the secondary He-rich star of the GW190425's progenitor before its core collapse can be efficiently spun up through tidal interaction, finally remaining as a NS with rotational energy even reaching $\sim10^{52}\,{\rm{erg}}$, which is always much higher than the neutrino-driven energy of the supernova (SN) explosion. If the newborn secondary NS is a magnetar, we expect that GW190425 can be the remnant of a magnetar-driven SN, e.g., a magnetar-driven ultra-stripped SN, a superluminous SN, or a broad-line Type Ic SN. Our results show that GW190425 could be formed through the isolated binary evolution, which involves a stable Case BB/BC MT just after the common envelope phase. On top of that, we show the He-rich star can be tidally spun up, potentially forming a spinning magnetized NS (magnetar) during the second SN explosion.</description>

      <title>AESOPUS 2.1: Low-Temperature Opacities Extended to High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the critical need for accurate Rosseland mean gas opacities in high-pressure environments, spanning temperatures from 100 K to 32000 K. Current opacity tables from Wichita State University and AESOPUS 2.0 are limited to $\log(R) \le 1$, where $R=\rho\, T_6^{-3}$ in units of $\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}(10^6\mathrm{K})^{-3}$. This is insufficient for modeling very low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planets with atmospheres exhibiting higher densities and pressures ($\log(R) &gt; 1$). Leveraging extensive databases such as ExoMol, ExoMolOP, MoLLIST, and HITEMP, we focus on expanding the AESOPUS opacity calculations to cover a broad range of pressure and density conditions ($-8 \leq \log(R) \leq +6$). We incorporate the thermal Doppler mechanism and micro-turbulence velocity. Pressure broadening effects on molecular transitions, leading to Lorentzian or Voigt profiles, are explored in the context of atmospheric profiles for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars. We also delve into the impact of electron degeneracy and non-ideal effects such as ionization potential depression under high-density conditions, emphasizing its notable influence on Rosseland mean opacities at temperatures exceeding $10,000$ K. As a result, this study expands AESOPUS public web interface for customized gas chemical mixtures, promoting flexibility in opacity calculations based on specific research needs. Additionally, pre-computed opacity tables, inclusive of condensates, are provided. We present a preliminary application to evolutionary models for very low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Spot Modeling through Multiband Photometry Analysis of V1298 Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Stellar activity consists of different phenomena, mainly spots and faculae, and it is one of the main sources of noise in exoplanetary observations because it affects both spectroscopic and photometric observations. If we want to study young active planetary systems we need to model the activity of the host stars in order to remove astrophysical noise from our observational data. Aims. We modelled the contribution of stellar spots in photometric observations. Through the use of multiband photometry, we aim to extract the geometric properties of the spots and constrain their temperature. Methods. We analyzed multiband photometric observations acquired with the 80 cm Marcon telescope of the Osservatorio Polifunzionale del Chianti of V1298 Tau, assuming that the photometric modulation observed in different bands should be due to cold spots. Results. We constrained the effective temperature of the active regions present on the surface of V1298 Tau, which is composed by the contemporary presence of spots and faculae. We tested our hypothesis on solar data, verifying that we measure the size of the dominant active region and its averaged effective temperature.</description>

      <title>MINDS. JWST-MIRI Observations of a Spatially Resolved Atomic Jet and Polychromatic Molecular Wind Toward SY Cha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.</description>

      <title>Colour-Based Disentangling of Mira Variables and Ultra-Cool Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite having different astronomical characteristics, the studies of mira variables and ultra-cool dwarfs frequently show similar red colors, which could cause leading to photometric misclassification. This study uses photometric data from the WISE, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS surveys to construct color-based selection criteria for red dwarfs, brown dwarfs, and Mira variables. On analyzing the color indices, we developed empirical rules that separate these objects with an overall classification accuracy of approximately 91%-92%. While the differentiation between red dwarfs and both Mira variables and brown dwarfs is effective, challenges remain in distinguishing Mira variables from brown dwarfs due to overlapping color indices. The robustness of our classification technique was validated by a bootstrap analysis, highlighting the significance of color indices in large photometric surveys for stellar classification.</description>

      <title>The Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) of the Andrei B. Severny Solar Tower Telescope (STT) at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory: Optical Design and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectro-Polarimeter (SP) is a new instrument installed at the upgraded Andrei B. Severny Solar Tower Telescope (STT) at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. The instrument is a traditional echelle slit dual-beam spectropolarimeter with temporal modulation of the polarization. STT-SP provides simultaneous spectropolarimetric observations of the Sun within three 15 Angstrom wide spectral ranges around photospheric Fe I 5250, Fe I 5324, and chromospheric Mg I b2 5172 spectral lines. The spectral resolution of the instrument reaches 70,000 with the seeing-constrained slit width of 1 arcsec. The field-of-view of STT-SP is 200 arcsec allowing one to map a moderate size active region within a single raster scan. The instrument will provide new opportunities in the analysis of magnetic fields and thermodynamics of the lower atmosphere of the Sun. In this paper we describe the optical design of STT-SP and present the preliminary results acquired during the commissioning of the instrument.</description>

      <title>Radial Velocity and Astrometric Evidence for a Close Companion to Betelgeuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a century of radial velocity, visual magnitude, and astrometric observations of the nearest red supergiant, Betelgeuse, in order to reexamine the century-old assertion that Betelgeuse might be a spectroscopic binary. These data reveal Betelgeuse varying stochastically over years and decades due to its boiling, convective envelope, periodically with a $ 5.78$~yr long secondary period, and quasi-periodically from pulsations with periods of several hundred days. We show that the long secondary period is consistent between astrometric and RV datasets, and argue that it indicates a low-mass companion to Betelgeuse, less than a solar mass, orbiting in a 2,110 day period at a separation of just over twice Betelgeuse's radius. The companion star would be nearly twenty times less massive and a million times fainter than Betelgeuse, with similar effective temperature, effectively hiding it in plain sight near one of the best-studied stars in the night sky. The astrometric data favor an edge-on binary with orbital plane aligned with Betelgeuse's measured spin axis. Tidal spin-orbit interaction drains angular momentum from the orbit and spins up Betelgeuse, explaining the spin--orbit alignment and Betelgeuse's anomalously rapid spin. In the future, the orbit will decay until the companion is swallowed by Betelgeuse in the next 10,000 years.</description>

      <title>Hertzsprung gap stars in nearby galaxies and the Quest for Luminous Red Novae Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the main sequence phase, stars more massive than 2.5 M$_\odot$ rapidly evolve through the Hertzsprung gap as yellow giants and supergiants (YSG), before settling into the red giant branch. Identifying YSG in nearby galaxies is crucial for pinpointing progenitors of luminous red novae (LRNe) - astrophysical transients attributed to stellar mergers. In the era of extensive transient surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST, this approach offers a new way to predict and select common envelope transients. This study investigates potential progenitors and precursors of LRNe by analysing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of stellar populations in galaxies within 20 Mpc to identify YSG candidates. Additionally, we use ZTF and MeerLICHT/BlackGEM to identify possible precursors, preparing for future observations by the LSST. We compiled a sample of 369 galaxies with HST exposures in the F475W, F555W, F606W, and F814W filters. We identified YSG candidates using MESA stellar evolution tracks and statistical analysis of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Our sample includes 246,573 YSG candidates with masses between 3 and 20 $M_\odot$ and is affected by various contaminants, such as foreground stars and extinguished main-sequence stars. After excluding foreground stars using Gaia proper motions, contamination is estimated at 1.7\% from foreground stars and 20\% from extinction affecting main-sequence stars. Combining our YSG candidates with time-domain catalogs yielded several interesting candidates. Notably, we identified 12 LRN precursor candidates for which followup is encouraged. We highlight the importance of monitoring future transients that match YSG candidates to avoid missing potential LRNe and other rare transients. LSST will be a game changer in the search for LRN progenitors and precursors, discovering over 300,000 new YSG and 100 precursors within 20 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Low to High Corona: Propagating Disturbances as Tracers of the Near-Sun Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a quiet 14-day period of solar minimum during January 2008 and track sub-streamer propagating disturbances (PDs) from low heights in STEREO/EUVI to the extended corona through STEREO/COR1 and into STEREO/COR2 along nonradial paths that trace the structure of the underlying streamers. Using our recently developed method for generating nonradial Height-Time profiles of outward PDs (OPDs) and inward PDs (IPDs), we obtained their velocities along the radial and position angle directions. Our analysis of 417 unique OPDs revealed two classes: slow and fast OPDs. Slow OPDs form preferentially at $\approx$1.6 $R_\odot$ closer to the streamer boundaries, with asymmetric occurrence rates, and show speeds of $16.4_{-8.4}^{+26.6}km/s$ at 1.5 $R_\odot$ and accelerate up to $200.1_{-57.9}^{+71.1}km/s$ at 7.5 $R_\odot$. Fast OPDs form preferentially at $\approx$ 1.6 $R_\odot$ and at $\approx$3.0 $R_\odot$ both at the streamer boundaries and slightly more often within them. They show speeds of $87.8_{-24.8}^{+59.1}km/s$ at 1.5 $R_\odot$ up to $197.8_{-46.7}^{+61.8}km/s$ at 7.5 $R_\odot$. IPDs are observed forming at $\approx$1.8 $R_\odot$ with speeds of tens of $km/s$, mostly concentrated in the aftermath of a CME eruption. We present an example in which we show that periodic brightness variations related to OPDs remained in the range of 98 to 128 min, down to $\approx$2.0 $R_\odot$, well within the field of view of COR1. The velocity profiles of slow OPDs for heliocentric height below 3.0 $R_\odot$ show good agreement with speeds more closely related to the bulk solar wind obtained via interplanetary scintillation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars play a key role in the evolution of the Universe, as sources of radiation, as dynamical engines, and as chemical factories. Outputs of stellar models are then central to various studies in astrophysics. Stellar physics links fundamental physical aspects to hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic processes, and the validity of stellar models depends directly on the modelling of these complex mechanisms. We describe here the different transport processes at work in stellar interiors and how the modelling of these processes can be improved thanks to the unique ability of asteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations, to probe the internal structure and dynamics of stars.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Diversity of Type IIn Supernovae via Systematic Light Curve Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNeIIn) are a highly heterogeneous subclass of core-collapse supernovae, spectroscopically characterized by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Here we systematically model the light curves of 142 archival SNeIIn using MOSFiT (the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients). We find that the observed and inferred properties of SNIIn are diverse, but there are some trends. The typical SN CSM is dense ($\sim$10$^{-12}$gcm$^{-3}$) with highly diverse CSM geometry, with a median CSM mass of $\sim$1M$_\odot$. The ejecta are typically massive ($\gtrsim10$M$_\odot$), suggesting massive progenitor systems. We find positive correlations between the CSM mass and the rise and fall times of SNeIIn. Furthermore there are positive correlations between the rise time and fall times and the $r$-band luminosity. We estimate the mass-loss rates of our sample (where spectroscopy is available) and find a high median mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-2}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$, with a range between 10$^{-4}$--1M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$. These mass-loss rates are most similar to the mass loss from great eruptions of luminous blue variables, consistent with the direct progenitor detections in the literature. We also discuss the role that binary interactions may play, concluding that at least some of our SNeIIn may be from massive binary systems. Finally, we estimate a detection rate of 1.6$\times$10$^5$yr$^{-1}$ in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Inferring stellar parameters and their uncertainties from high-resolution spectroscopy using invertible neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: New spectroscopic surveys will increase the number of astronomical objects requiring characterization by over tenfold.. Machine learning tools are required to address this data deluge in a fast and accurate fashion. Most machine learning algorithms can not estimate error directly, making them unsuitable for reliable science.
  Aims: We aim to train a supervised deep-learning algorithm tailored for high-resolution observational stellar spectra. This algorithm accurately infer precise estimates while providing coherent estimates of uncertainties by leveraging information from both the neural network and the spectra.
  Methods: We train a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN) on observational spectroscopic data obtained from the GIRAFFE spectrograph (HR10 and HR21 setups) within the Gaia-ESO survey. A key features of cINN is its ability to produce the Bayesian posterior distribution of parameters for each spectrum. By analyzing this distribution, we inferred parameters and their uncertainties. Several tests have been applied to study how parameters and errors are estimated.
  Results: We achieved an accuracy of 28K in $T_{\text{eff}}$, 0.06 dex in $\log g$, 0.03 dex in $[\text{Fe/H}]$, and between 0.05 dex and 0.17 dex for the other abundances for high quality spectra. Accuracy remains stable with low signal-to-noise ratio spectra. The uncertainties obtained are well within the same order of magnitude. The network accurately reproduces astrophysical relationships both on the scale of the Milky Way and within smaller star clusters. We created a table containing the new parameters generated by our cINN.
  Conclusion: This neural network represents a compelling proposition for future astronomical surveys. These coherent derived uncertainties make it possible to reuse these estimates in other works as Bayesian priors and thus present a solid basis for future work.</description>

      <title>The Sun's Birth Environment: Context for Meteoritics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meteorites trace planet formation in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, but they also record the influence of the Sun's birth environment. Whether the Sun formed in a region like Taurus-Auriga with ~10^2 stars, or a region like the Carina Nebula with ~10^6 stars, matters for how large the Sun's disk was, for how long and from how far away it accreted gas from the molecular cloud, and how it acquired radionuclides like 26Al. To provide context for the interpretation of meteoritic data, we review what is known about the Sun's birth environment. Based on an inferred gas disk outer radius ~50-90 AU, radial transport in the disk, and the abundances of noble gases in Jupiter's atmosphere, the Sun's molecular cloud and protoplanetary disk were exposed to an ultraviolet flux G0 ~30-3000 during its birth and first ~10 Myr of evolution. Based on the orbits of Kuiper Belt objects, the Solar System was subsequently exposed to a stellar density ~100 Msol/pc^3 for ~100 Myr, strongly implying formation in a bound cluster. These facts suggest formation in a region like the outskirts of the Orion Nebula, perhaps 2 pc from the center. The protoplanetary disk might have accreted gas for many Myr, but a few x10^5 yr seems more likely. It probably inherited radionuclides from its molecular cloud, enriched by inputs from supernovae and especially Wolf-Rayet star winds, and acquired a typical amount of 26Al.</description>

      <title>A close pair of orbiters embedded in a gaseous disk: the repulsive effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework and use two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to study the repulsive effect between two close orbiters embedded in an accretion disk. We consider orbiters on fixed Keplerian orbits with masses low enough to open shallow gaps. The simulations indicate that the repulsion is larger for more massive orbiters and decreases with the orbital separation and the disk's viscosity. We use two different assumptions to derive theoretical scaling relations for the repulsion. A first scenario assumes that each orbiter absorbs the angular momentum deposited in its horseshoe region by the companion's wake. A second scenario assumes that the corotation torques of the orbiters are modified because the companion changes the underlying radial gradient of the disk surface density. We find a substantial difference between the predictions of these two scenarios. The first one fails to reproduce the scaling of the repulsion with the disk viscosity and generally overestimates the strength of the repulsion. The second scenario, however, gives results that are broadly consistent with those obtained in the simulations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a millisecond pulsar associated with Terzan 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations show that globular clusters might be among the best places to find millisecond pulsars. However, the globular cluster Terzan 6 seems to be an exception without any pulsar discovered, although its high stellar encounter rate suggests that it harbors dozens of them. We report the discovery of the first radio pulsar, PSR J1751-3116A, likely associated with Terzan 6 in a search of C-band (4-8 GHz) data from the Green Bank Telescope with a spin period of 5.33 ms and dispersion measure, DM$\simeq$383 ${\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$. The mean flux density of this pulsar is approximately 3 ${\rm \mu Jy}$. The DM agrees well with predictions from the Galactic free electron density model, assuming a distance of 6.7 kpc for Terzan 6. PSR J1751-3116A is likely an isolated millisecond pulsar, potentially formed through dynamical interactions, considering the core-collapsed classification and the exceptionally high stellar encounter rate of Terzan 6. This is the highest radio frequency observation that has led to the discovery of a pulsar in a globular cluster to date. While L-band (1-2 GHz) observations of this cluster are unlikely to yield significant returns due to propagation effects, we predict that further pulsar discoveries in Terzan 6 will be made by existing radio telescopes at higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>Powerful flares and magneto-elastic oscillations of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetars are neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields which can exceed 1e15 G. Some magnetars (the so-called soft gamma-repeaters) demonstrate occasionally very powerful processes of energy release, which result in exceptionally strong flares of electromagnetic radiation. It is believed that these flares are associated with the presence of superstrong magnetic fields. Despite many hypotheses, the mechanism of these flares remains a mystery. In afterglows of the flares, one has often observed quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of magnetar emission. They are interpreted as stellar vibrations, excited by the flares, which are useful for exploring the nature of magnetar activity. The incompleteness of theories employed to interpret magnetar QPOs is discussed.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Magnetized Asteroseismic Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve for waves in a polytropic, stratified plasmas with a spatially varying background magnetic field that points along a horizontal $x$-direction, and with gravity that is directed along the vertical $z$-direction. Force balance determines the magnitude of the background magnetic field, $B_0^2 \sim z^{n+1}$, where $n$ is the polytropic index. Using numerical and asymptotic methods, we deduce an explicit dispersion relation for fast pressure-driven waves: $\Omega^2 \sim K\left(2m+n\right) \left[1 + (1/M_\mathrm{A})^2 (4-2\gamma+\cos^2\theta-3\cos^4\theta)/4 \right]$. Here, $\Omega$ is the frequency, $K$ the wavenumber, $\theta$ the angle the wave-vector makes with the background magnetic field, $M_\mathrm{A}$ the Alfv\'enic Mach number, and $m$ an integer representing the eigenstate. We discuss roles of such an explicit formula in asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and Source Regions of Slow Alfvenic Solar Wind Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a classification scheme for solar wind type based on the heliocentric distance of the observation, we look at near perihelion observations from Parker Solar Probe Encounters Four to Fourteen to study the sources of the slow Alfv$\'e$nic solar wind (SASW). Through Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic mapping, we connect streams to their solar source and find that a primary population of SASW comes from low magnetic field strength regions (low-$B_0$), likely small coronal holes (CHs) and their over-expanded boundaries, while a second population of high field strength (high-$B_0$) seems to emerge from non-CH structures potentially through interchange reconnection with nearby open field lines. This low-$B_0$ SASW shows larger expansion than the fast solar wind (FSW) but similar mass flux, potentially indicating additional heating below the critical point, and emergence from a cooler structure, which could lead to slower wind emerging from CH-like structures. We show that this low-$B_0$ SASW shows stronger preferential acceleration of alpha particles (similar to the FSW) than the high-$B_0$ SASW, and that this is a velocity dependent phenomenon as found in previous studies. To have additional confidence in our mapping results, we quantify the error on both the PFSS model and ballistic mapping and discuss how additional multi-point observations of plasma parameters and composition would allow us to better constrain our models and connect the solar wind to its source.</description>

      <title>Assessing realistic binding energies of some essential interstellar radicals with amorphous solid water. A fully quantum chemical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the absence of laboratory data, state-of-the-art quantum chemical approaches can provide estimates of the binding energy (BE) of interstellar species with grains. Without BE values, contemporary astrochemical models are compelled to utilize wild guesses, often delivering misleading information. Here, we employed a fully quantum chemical approach to estimate the BE of seven diatomic radicals - CH, NH, OH, SH, CN, NS, and NO - that play a crucial role in shaping the interstellar chemical composition, using a suitable amorphous solid water model as a substrate since water is the principal constituent of interstellar ice in dense and shielded regions. While the BEs are compatible with physisorption, the binding of CH in some sites shows chemisorption, in which a chemical bond to an oxygen atom of a water molecule is formed. While no structural change has been observed for the CN radical, it is believed that the formation of a hemibonded system between the outer layer of the water cluster and the radical is the reason for the unusually large BE in one of the binding sites considered in our study. A significantly lower BE for NO, consistent with recent calculations, is obtained, which helps explain the recently observed HONO/NH$_2$OH and HONO/HNO ratios in the low-mass hot corino IRAS 16293-2422 B with chemical models.</description>
