      <title>On free energy of non-convex multi-species spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [arXiv:2311.08980], it was shown that if the limit of the free energy in a non-convex vector spin glass model exists, it must be a critical value of a certain functional. In this work, we extend this result to multi-species spin glass models with non-convex interactions, where spins from different species may lie in distinct vector spaces. Since the species proportions may be irrational and the existence of the limit of the free energy is not generally known, non-convex multi-species models cannot be approximated by vector spin models in a straightforward manner, necessitating more careful treatment.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of Wigner delay times and resonance widths of tight-binding random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delay experienced by a probe due to interactions with a scattering media is highly related to the internal dynamics inside that media. This property is well captured by the Wigner delay time and the resonance widths. By the use of the equivalence between the adjacency matrix of a random graph and the tight-binding Hamiltonian of the corresponding electronic media, the scattering matrix approach to electronic transport is used to compute Wigner delay times and resonance widths of Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs and random geometric graphs, including bipartite random geometric graphs. In particular, the situation when a single-channel lead attached to the graphs is considered. Our results show a smooth crossover towards universality as the graphs become complete. We also introduce a parameter $\xi$, depending on the graph average degree $\langle k \rangle$ and graph size $N$, that scales the distributions of both Wigner delay times and resonance widths; highlighting the universal character of both distributions. Specifically, $\xi = \langle k \rangle N^{-\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ is graph-model dependent.</description>

      <title>Dyson Brownian motion and random matrix dynamics of weight matrices during learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During training, weight matrices in machine learning architectures are updated using stochastic gradient descent or variations thereof. In this contribution we employ concepts of random matrix theory to analyse the resulting stochastic matrix dynamics. We first demonstrate that the dynamics can generically be described using Dyson Brownian motion, leading to e.g. eigenvalue repulsion. The level of stochasticity is shown to depend on the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, explaining the empirically observed linear scaling rule. We verify this linear scaling in the restricted Boltzmann machine. Subsequently we study weight matrix dynamics in transformers (a nano-GPT), following the evolution from a Marchenko-Pastur distribution for eigenvalues at initialisation to a combination with additional structure at the end of learning.</description>

      <title>A Random-Key Optimizer for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04293v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), a versatile and efficient stochastic local search method tailored for combinatorial optimization problems. Using the random-key concept, RKO encodes solutions as vectors of random keys that are subsequently decoded into feasible solutions via problem-specific decoders. The RKO framework is able to combine a plethora of classic metaheuristics, each capable of operating independently or in parallel, with solution sharing facilitated through an elite solution pool. This modular approach allows for the adaptation of various metaheuristics, including simulated annealing, iterated local search, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, among others. The efficacy of the RKO framework, implemented in C++, is demonstrated through its application to three NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the alpha-neighborhood p-median problem, the tree of hubs location problem, and the node-capacitated graph partitioning problem. The results highlight the framework's ability to produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem domains, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Parisi-Sourlas Supertranslation and Scale without Conformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling and entanglement dynamics in Floquet Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and entanglement of entropy as quantitative measures of information propagation in disordered many-body systems exhibiting Floquet time-crystal (FTC) phases. We find that OTOC spreads in the FTC with different characteristic timescales due to the existence of a preferred ``quasi-protected'' direction - denoted as $\ell$-bit direction - along which the spins stabilize their period-doubling magnetization for exponentially long times. While orthogonal to this direction the OTOC thermalizes as an usual MBL time-independent system (at stroboscopic times), along the $\ell$-bit direction the system features a more complex structure. The scrambling appears as a combination of an initially frozen dynamics (while in the stable period doubling magnetization time window) and a later logarithmic slow growth (over its decoherence regime) till full thermalization. Interestingly, in the late time regime, since the wavefront propagation of correlations has already settled through the whole chain, scrambling occurs at the same rate regardless of the distance between the spins, thus resulting in an overall envelope-like structure of all OTOCs, independent of their distance, merging into a single growth. Alongside, the entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic growth over all time, reflecting the slow dynamics up to a thermal volume-law saturation.</description>

      <title>Ultraslow Growth of Number Entropy in an l-bit Model of Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that slow growth of the number entropy following a quench from a local product state is consistent with many-body localization. To do this we construct a random circuit l-bit model with exponentially localized l-bits and exponentially decaying interactions between them. We observe an ultraslow growth of the number entropy starting from a N\'eel state, saturating at a value that grows with system size. This suggests that the observation of such growth in microscopic models is not sufficient to rule out many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Hybrid scaling properties of localization transition in a non-Hermitian disorder Aubry-Andr\'{e} model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the critical behaviors in the non-Hermitian disorder Aubry-Andr\'{e} (DAA) model, and we assume the non-Hermiticity is introduced by nonreciprocal hopping. We employ the localization length $\xi$, the inverse participation ratio ($\rm IPR$), and the energy gap $\Delta E$ as the characteristic quantities to describe the critical properties of the localization transition. By performing scaling analysis, the critical exponents of the non-Hermitian Anderson model and the non-Hermitian DAA model are obtained, and these critical exponents are different from their Hermitian counterparts, indicating that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson and DAA models belong to different universality classes. The critical exponents of the non-Hermitian DAA model are remarkably different from both the pure non-Hermitian AA model and the non-Hermitian Anderson model, showing that disorder is an independent relevant direction at the non-Hermitian AA model critical point. We further propose a hybrid scaling law to describe the critical behavior in the overlapping critical region constituted by the critical regions of the non-Hermitian DAA model and the non-Hermitian Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution to Heisenberg spin glass models on sparse random graphs and their de Almeida-Thouless line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results regarding spin glass models are, to this day, mainly confined to models with Ising spins. Spin glass models with continuous spins exhibit interesting new physical behaviors related to the additional degrees of freedom, but have been primarily studied on fully connected topologies. Only recently some advancements have been made in the study of continuous models on sparse graphs. In this work we partially fill this void by introducing a method to solve numerically the Belief Propagation equations for systems of Heisenberg spins on sparse random graphs via a discretization of the sphere. We introduce techniques to study the finite-temperature, finite-connectivity case as well as novel algorithms to deal with the zero-temperature and large connectivity limits. As an application, we locate the de Almeida-Thouless line for this class of models and the critical field at zero temperature, showing the full consistency of the methods presented. Beyond the specific results reported for Heisenberg models, the approaches presented in this paper have a much broader scope of application and pave the way to the solution of strongly disordered models with continuous variables.</description>

      <title>The onset of temperature chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature chaos (TC) in spin glasses has been claimed to exist no matter how small the temperature change, $\Delta T$. However, experimental studies have exhibited a finite value of $\Delta T$ for a transition to TC. This paper explores the onset of TC with much higher resolution than before and over a larger temperature range. We find that TC is always present, though small at the smallest $\Delta T$ that we can reliably measure. However, it grows rapidly as $\Delta T$ increases, the region of rapid growth coinciding with the $\Delta T$ predicted from renormalization group arguments and observed experimentally. We are able to transcend the full range of TC, from reversible (TC = 0) to fully chaotic (complete TC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: NP-hard computational problems can be efficiently recast as finding the ground state of an effective spin model. However, to date no convenient setup exists that can universally simulate all of them, even for a fixed problem size. Here we present such a setup, using a series of optical (or polaritonic) resonators arranged in a chain using the geometry recently introduced in [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 024057 (2024)]. We demonstrate by example how the simulator solves Hamiltonian Cycle and traveling salesman problems, and show that it generalises to any NP-hard problem of arbitrary size.</description>
