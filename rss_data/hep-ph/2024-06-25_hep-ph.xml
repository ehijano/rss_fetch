      <title>The Resurgence of the G(2) Group for the Strong Sector and the Emergence of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G(2) is the smallest exceptional group and it is the simplest and viable gauge group to minimally extend the strong interaction sector: G(2) includes the group SU(3) of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) as a maximal subgroup and it is equipped with six additional gluons that can acquire mass via a Higgs mechanism driven by a new Higgs particle and constitute dark matter. In this article I want to describe how the exceptional G(2) group can be a physical gauge group, capable of extending the Standard Model (SM) of particles and including a versatile dark sector, which is compatible with experimental observations. In fact, due to its peculiar mathematical features, the group G(2) manifests some complex features, not properly considered in literature, which guarantee its correct use in physics, as its {3}+anti{3} decompositions w.r.t. SU(3) can acquire a complex structure. The resulting framework can be a solid Beyond Standard Model (BSM) solution for the dark matter (DM) problem, in the form of massive complex scalar glueballs, and it includes the proper color representations for quarks and leptons. Several quantum field theory features are discussed, like the G(2) coupling constant running and its spectrum before and after the phase transition, along with all the DM astrophysical realizations, in order to present the unexpected potential of this gauge group.</description>

      <title>The next galactic supernova can uncover mass and couplings of particles decaying to neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many particles predicted by extensions of the Standard Model feature interactions with neutrinos, e.g., Majoron-like bosons $\phi$. If the mass of $\phi$ is larger than about 10 keV, they can be produced abundantly in the core of the next galactic core-collapse supernova through neutrino coalescence, and leave it with energies of around 100 MeV. Their subsequent decay to high-energy neutrinos and anti-neutrinos provides a distinctive signature at Earth. Ongoing and planned neutrino and dark matter experiments allow us to reconstruct the energy, flavor, and time of arrival of these high-energy neutrinos. For the first time, we show that these measurements can help pinpointing the mass of $\phi$ and its couplings to neutrinos of different flavor. Our results can be generalized in a straightforward manner to other hypothetical feebly interacting particles, like novel gauge bosons or heavy neutral leptons, that decay into neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Constraining pseudo-Diracness with astrophysical neutrino flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three Standard Model neutrinos can have Majorana mass or strictly Dirac mass, but both scenarios are practically indistinguishable in neutrino oscillation experiments. If they are pseudo-Dirac, however, there will be new mass splittings among the pseudo-Dirac pairs, potentially leaving traces in neutrino oscillation phenomena. In this work, we use flavor ratios of astrophysical neutrinos to discriminate different possible mass spectra of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos. We show that it will be possible to impose robust bounds of order $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-12}$ $\text{eV}^2$ on the new mass squared splitting involving the third pseudo-Dirac mass eigenstates (those with the least electron flavor composition) with the future experiment IceCube-Gen2. The derived sensitivity is robust because it only assumes an extragalactic origin for the astrophysical neutrinos and hierarchical pseudo-Dirac mass spectrum. In case the neutrino sources are known in the future, such bounds can potentially improve by up to five orders of magnitude, reaching $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-17}$ $\text{eV}^2$.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Corrections and EFT Operators in $W^+W^-$ production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of electroweak corrections and Effective Field Theory operators on $W^+W^-$ production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Utilising the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, we extend the Standard Model by incorporating higher-dimensional operators to encapsulate potential new physics effects. These operators allow for a model-independent approach to data interpretation, essential for probing beyond the Standard Model physics. We generate pseudo data at the next-to-leading order in Quantum Chromodynamics and include approximate electroweak corrections. Our analysis focuses on the interplay between these corrections and SMEFT operators at leading order. The inclusion of electroweak corrections is crucial as they can counteract the effects predicted by SMEFT operators, necessitating precise theoretical and experimental handling. By examining $pp \to W^+W^-$ production, a process sensitive to the electroweak symmetry-breaking mechanism, we demonstrate the importance of these corrections in isolating and interpreting new physics signatures. Our results highlight the significant role of electroweak corrections in enhancing the interpretative power of LHC data and in obtaining reliable constraints on new physics interactions.</description>

      <title>Decay of CP-even Higgs $H\rightarrow h \gamma \gamma$ in Two Higgs Doublet Model: (I) one-loop analytic results, ward identity checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first analytical expressions for one-loop induced contributions for the decay channels of CP-even Higgs $H\rightarrow h \gamma \gamma$ with $h$ being standard model-like Higgs boson within the framework of Two Higgs Doublet Model in this paper. One-loop form factors for the decay processes are written in terms of the scalar Passarino-Veltman functions following the general notations of the package~{\tt LoopTools} as well as the library {\tt Collier}. Subsequently, physical results for the decay processes can be generated numerically by using one of the above-mentioned packages. The analytical expressions shown in this paper, are verified by several numerical checks, for examples, the ultraviolet (UV) and the infrared (IR) finiteness for one-loop amplitude. Furthermore, the amplitude must be followed the so-called ward identity due to on-shell photons in final states. The identity can also be tested numerically in this work. We find that the numerical results for the checks are good stability. In phenomenological studies, the differential decay rates as functions of the invariant of two photons in final state of $H\rightarrow h \gamma \gamma$ are first studied in parameter space for all types of Two Higgs Doublet Models.</description>

      <title>Theoretical predictions for $t{\bar t}W$ cross sections at approximate N$^3$LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical calculations of higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections for the associated production of a top-antitop quark pair and a $W$ boson ($t{\bar t}W$ production) at LHC energies. We show predictions for cross sections at approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) which include second-order and third-order soft-gluon corrections added to the exact NLO QCD+electroweak result. We compare our results to recent measurements from the LHC, and we find that our predictions provide improved agreement with the data. We also calculate the top-quark transverse momentum and rapidity distributions in $t{\bar t}W$ production. We find significant enhancements from the higher-order corrections to the total and differential cross sections for this process.</description>

      <title>Investigating higgsino dark matter in the semi-constrained NMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the characteristics of higgsino-dominated dark matter (DM) within the semi-constrained Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (scNMSSM), covering a mass range from hundreds of GeV to several TeV. We carefully analyzed the parameter space under existing theoretical and experimental constraints to confirm the viability of higgsino-dominated lightest supersymmetric particles (LSPs) with masses between 100 GeV and 4 TeV. Our study examines various DM annihilation mechanisms, emphasizing the significant role of coannihilation with the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), which includes other higgsino-dominated particles such as $\tilde{\chi}^{0}_2$ and $\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1$. We categorize the annihilation processes into three main classes: $\tilde{\chi}_1^{\pm}$ coannihilation, Higgs funnel annihilation, and $\tilde{\tau}_1$ coannihilation, each combines interactions with $\tilde{\chi}_1^{\pm}$. Our results indicate that achieving the correct relic density in heavier higgsino LSPs requires a combination of coannihilation and Higgs funnel mechanisms. We also assess the potential of future experiments, such as XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), PandaX-xT, and the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), to probe these DM scenarios through direct and indirect detection. In particular, future spin-independent DM detection can cover all samples with the correct DM relic density for $\mu \gtrsim 1300$ GeV. Furthermore, future colliders like the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) are found to exceed the detection capabilities of current hadron colliders, especially for higher mass NLSPs. Notably, CLIC at 3000 GeV is anticipated to thoroughly investigate all samples with insufficient DM relic density for $\mu \lesssim 1300$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Theoretical constraints on models with vector-like fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a set of theoretical constraints on models in which the Standard Model field content is extended by vector-like fermions and in some cases also by a real scalar singlet. Our approach is based on the study of electroweak vacuum stability, perturbativity of model couplings and gauge couplings unification with the use of renormalization group equations. We show that careful analysis of these issues leads to strong constraints on the parameter space of the considered models. This, in turn, has important implications for phenomenology, as we show using examples of the electroweak phase transition and the double Higgs boson production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report summarises important technical challenges and their solutions in the calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the width difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$ in the $B_s-\overline{B}_s$ system. We focus on the treatment of spinor structures with products of up to 22 $\gamma$ matrices by means of projection and tensor integrals. Moreover, we present an approach for the semi-numeric computation of master integrals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the one-boson-exchange model, we investigate the interactions between the doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}(3621)$ and the $S-$wave (anti-)kaon accounting for the $S-D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. We find the coupled $\Xi_{cc}K/\Xi_{cc}K^*$ state with $I(J^P)=0(1/2^-)$, the $\Xi_{cc}K^*$ state with $0(1/2^-)$, the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ state with $0(1/2^-)$, and the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}^*$ states with $0(1/2^-,3/2^-)$ can be recommended as good doubly charmed molecular candidates with strangeness $|S|=1$. We further examine their M1 radiative decay behaviors and magnetic moments within the constituent quark model framework. This information can enhance our understanding of their inner structures, including the distribution of electric charge and the orientation of the constituent quarks' spins.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling from Inclusive Semi-leptonic Decay of Charmed Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the heavy quark expansion with kinetic scheme, we study the strong interaction coupling $\alpha_S$ at an energy corresponding to the charm quark mass $m_c$ using the data on the semi-leptonic decays of charmed mesons from the BESIII and CLEO-c. The values of the $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ from the $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ are extracted and found to be consistent. Combining the semileptonic decay widths of the $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$, we determine $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ to be $0.377\pm0.008\pm0.114$, where the first and second uncertainty are the experimental and theoretical uncertainty separately. This result is in good agreement with the world average of $\alpha_S$ running from Z pole to the $m_c$.</description>

      <title>A Benchmarking of QCD Evolution at Approximate $N^3LO$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed benchmarking of different treatments of the QCD evolution of unpolarized PDFs at approximate $N^3LO$ ($aN^3LO$) order in the QCD coupling. Namely, the implementations in the public $aN^3LO$ releases of the MSHT and NNPDF global PDF fitters, as well as that of the theoretical FHMRUVV collaboration are compared. This follows the same procedure as in previous benchmarking exercises at lower order, that is by considering the impact of this evolution on a set of simple toy PDFs.</description>

      <title>Comments on the publication "Discrete symmetries tested at 10e-4 precision using linear polarization of photons from positronium annihilations" by P. Moskal et al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The authors of Ref.[1] (referred to here as "Moskal et al.") claim to have performed the most precise test of P, T and CP invariance in the decay of ortho-Positronium. In this note: 1) we demonstrate, assuming standard properties for Compton scattering, that the average value of the correlation measured by Moskal et al. must necessarily be zero, independently of any physics occurring in o-Ps decay; 2) we point out that there is no formal justification to equate the normal vector to the Compton scattering plane with the incident photon polarization, as done by Moskal et al.; 3) we observe the absence of characterization of the device as a Compton polarimeter, which is paramount in photon polarimetry; 4) we review previous measurements of the polarization of photons from o-Ps decay, properly implementing the Compton polarimetry technique, and make the connection with tests of discrete symmetries; and 5) we stress that the correlation proposed by Moskal et al. cannot be generated solely by the physics of o-Ps decay, including possible violations of discrete symmetries.</description>

      <title>Displaced Heavy Neutral Lepton from New Higgs Doublet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons $N$ are introduced to explain the tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. For proper small mixing parameter $V_{\ell N}$, the heavy neutral leptons $N$ become long-lived, which leads to the displaced vertex signature at colliders. In this paper, we consider the displaced heavy neutral lepton from the neutrinophilic Higgs doublet $\Phi_\nu$ decay. The new Higgs doublet with MeV scale VEV can naturally explain the tiny neutrino masses with TeV scale $N$. Different from current experimental searches via the $W^\pm\to \ell^\pm N$ decay, the new decays as $H^\pm\to \ell^\pm N$ are not suppressed by the small mixing parameter $V_{\ell N}$. Therefore, a larger parameter space is expected to be detected at colliders. We then investigate the promising region at the 14 TeV HL-LHC and the 3 TeV CLIC. According to our simulation, the DV signature could probe $|V_{\ell N}|^2\gtrsim10^{-19}$ with $m_N&lt;m_{H^+}$, which covers the seesaw predicted value $|V_{\ell N}|^2\sim m_\nu/m_N$. We could probe $m_{H^+}\lesssim1200$ GeV at the 14 TeV HL-LHC and $m_{H^+}\lesssim1490$ GeV at the 3 TeV CLIC.</description>

      <title>Constraining long-lived particles from Higgs decays at the LHC with displaced vertices and jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lived particles (LLPs) originating from decays of the Standard-Model or Beyond-the-Standard-Model Higgs bosons are often featured with signatures of displaced vertices (DVs) and jets at colliders. In this work, we show that a recent ATLAS search for DVs plus jets, with its recast implementation, can efficiently place bounds on such hadronically or semi-leptonically decaying LLPs. In particular, we find the search is uniquely sensitive to LLP proper decay lengths of about $1-100$ mm, probing complementary regions in the parameter space of the relevant models compared to other prompt and LLP searches.</description>

Abstract: The Bell nonlocality and entanglement are two kinds of quantum correlations in quantum systems. Due to the recent upgrade in Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) experiment, it is possible to explore the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems produced in electron-positron annihilation with high precision data. We provide a systematic method for studying quantum correlations in spin-1/2 hyperon-antihyperon systems through the measures for the nonlocality and entanglement. We find that with nonvanishing polarizations of the hyperon and its antihyperon, the kinematic region of nonlocality in the hyperon-antihyperon system is more restricted than the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ system in which polarizations of $\tau$ leptons are vanishing. We also present an experimental proposal to probe the nonlocality and entanglement in hyperon-antihyperon systems at BSEIII.</description>

      <title>Large CP Violation from the Minimum Seesaw Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimum seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos is considered, where the lightest neutrino is naturally massless. Instead of adopting texture zeros in the lepton Yukawa matrices, which cause both theoretical and experimental troubles, here we propose two-$\boldsymbol\epsilon$ textures, where $\boldsymbol\epsilon$ is a small number. Combined with neutrino oscillation experimental data, we find that a large CP angle is preferred for the normal neutrino mass order. In contrast, the CP angle almost vanishes for the inverted order. This can be well-tested in near-future experiments, such as Hyper-Kamiokande. Besides, the predicted effective Majorana neutrino mass $m_{ee}$ and the total neutrino mass $\sum m^\nu_i$ are also within reach of ongoing or future experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark matter from strong phase transitions in a $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model: Implications for neutrino masses and muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a non-minimal gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model, where we add two complex singlet scalars, three right-handed Majorana neutrinos (RHN), and a vector-like dark fermion to the Standard Model (SM), all non-trivially charged under the extra gauge symmetry. The model offers an easy resolution to the muon $(g-2)$ anomaly, which fixes the scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, the two-zero minor structure in the RHN mass matrix provides successful predictions for neutrino oscillation parameters, including the Dirac phase. The extended scalar sector can easily induce first-order phase transitions. We identify all possible phase transition patterns in the three-dimensional field space. We quantify the associated gravitational waves from the sound wave source and demonstrate that the signatures can be observed in future space-based experiments. We find that strong first-order phase transitions require large values of scalar quartic couplings which constrain the scalar dark matter (DM) relic density to a maximum of $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-5}$ when we consider the DM direct detection bound. Nonetheless, the model successfully explains the DM relic density via contribution from the vector-like dark fermion. We show the allowed range of the model parameters that can address all the beyond SM issues targeted in this study.</description>

      <title>Probing the Neutrino Seesaw Scale with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos are the most elusive particles of the Standard Model. The physics behind their masses remains unknown and requires introducing new particles and interactions. An elegant solution to this problem is provided by the seesaw mechanism. Typically considered at a high scale, it is potentially testable in gravitational wave experiments by searching for a spectrum from cosmic strings, which offers a rather generic signature across many high-scale seesaw models. Here we consider the possibility of a low-scale seesaw mechanism at the PeV scale, generating neutrino masses within the framework of a model with gauged U(1) lepton number. In this case, the gravitational wave signal at high frequencies arises from a first order phase transition in the early Universe, whereas at low frequencies it is generated by domain wall annihilation, leading to a double-peaked structure in the gravitational wave spectrum. The signals discussed here can be searched for in upcoming experiments, including gravitational wave interferometers, pulsar timing arrays, and astrometry observations.</description>

      <title>Production of pentaquarks with hidden charm and double strangeness in $\Xi_b$ and $\Omega_b$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several pentaquark states $P_{css}$, with global flavor $\bar c c s s n$, have been predicted within a theoretical framework based on unitary coupled channels. We study theoretically the feasibility to observe the $P_{css}$ with $I(J^P)=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ in the decays $\Xi_b^0\to \eta \eta_c \Xi^0$ and $\Omega_b^-\to K^- \eta_c \Xi^0$. Indeed, within the model, the $\eta_c \Xi^0$ channel is the lowest mass pseudoscalar-baryon channel to which this pentaquark state couples, thus we can expect to observe its signal in the $\eta_c \Xi^0$ invariant mass distribution of the mentioned decays. We identify the dominant weak decay processes and then implement the hadronization into the different meson-baryon channels in the final state, linked by flavor symmetry. The dominant meson-baryon final state interaction is then implemented to generate the full amplitude, implicitly accounting for the dynamical emergence of the pentaquark states. We obtain a clear Breit-Wigner-like resonant signal in the spectrum of the $\Omega_b^-$ decay, exceeding that in the $\Xi_b^0$ decay by two to three orders of magnitude. In the case of the latter decay, the resonant state would manifest as a significant dip in the spectrum. We study the feasibility of searching for these $b$-hadron decay modes and analysing their resonant components using the current and future data samples from the LHCb experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a scotogenic model augmented with an additional U(1) gauge and a discrete Z2 symmetry. The lightest Z2-odd particle in our model becomes the dark matter (DM) candidate while tiny neutrino masses are realized at one loop. We explore the parameter space of the model for which the DM relic density is satisfied, and the correct low-energy neutrino observables are reproduced. The extended gauge symmetry includes beyond Standard Model (SM) particle spectrum consisting of vector-like fermions and scalars. We also highlight possible collider signatures of these particles at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Radiative QED corrections to the lepton anomaly from four-loop vacuum polarization insertions with three identical leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical expressions for the tenth order electromagnetic corrections to the lepton ($L=e, ~\mu $ and $\tau$) anomaly $a_L$ are derived explicitly for a class of Feynman diagrams with insertions of the vacuum polarization operator consisting of four closed lepton loops. We consider a particular case when one loop is formed by the lepton $L$ of the same kind as the one under consideration, the other three loops being formed by leptons $\ell\neq L$. The method is based on the consecutive application of dispersion relations for the polarization operator and the Mellin--Barnes transform for the propagators of massive particles. The result is expressed in terms of the mass ratio $r=m_\ell/m_L$. We investigate the behaviour of the exact analytical expressions as $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ and compare them with the corresponding asymptotic expansions known in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first purely theoretical calculation of the weak mixing angle in the MS scheme at low energies by combining results from lattice QCD with perturbation theory. We discuss its correlation with the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and to the energy dependence of the electromagnetic coupling. We also compare the results with calculations using cross-section data as input. Implications for the Standard Model prediction of the mass of the W boson are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some phenomenological aspects of Lee-Wick (LW) QED. In particular, we show that LW QED implies charge dequantization and a flavor-dependent LW scale. We study the implications of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in LW QED and calculate the modified electric force and potential and use the former to reformulate the WGC in LW QED. We also calculate the photon self-energy and the Uehling potential in LW QED. We show that bounds on milli-charged particles from matter neutrality experiments and from Cavendish-type experiments set stringent limits on the LW scale of fermions and of the photon.</description>

      <title>Modeling of axion and electromagnetic fields coupling in a particle-in-cell code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions have aroused widespread research interest because they can solve the strong CP problem and serve as a possible candidate for dark matter. Currently, people have explored a lot of axion detection experiments, including passively detecting the existing axions in the universe, and actively generating axions in the laboratory. Recently, axion-coupled laser-plasma interactions have been discussed as a novel method to detect axions. Petawatt (PW) lasers are considered as a powerful tool to study not only the vacuum polarization but also the axion coupling, due to their extreme fields. However, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation is still missed in current studies, which limits the understanding of axion-coupled laser-plasma interactions. In this paper, we proposed the method to include the axion field and the coupling with electromagnetic (EM) fields in PIC codes. The axion wave equation and modified Maxwell's equations are numerically solved, while the EM field modulation from axions is considered as a first-order perturbation. Meanwhile, different axion field boundary conditions are considered to satisfy different simulation scenarios. The processes of conversions between axions and photons, and weak laser pulse propagation with axion effects are checked as benchmarks of the code. Such an extended PIC code may help researchers develop novel axion detection schemes based on laser-plasma interactions and provide a better understanding of axion-coupled astrophysical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino trident production of di-lepton pairs is well recognized as a sensitive probe of both electroweak physics and physics beyond the Standard Model. Although a rare process, it could be significantly boosted by such new physics, and it also allows the electroweak theory to be tested in a new regime. We demonstrate that the forward neutrino physics program at the Large Hadron Collider offers a promising opportunity to measure for the first time, dimuon neutrino tridents with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$. We present predictions for various proposed experiments and outline a specific experimental strategy to identify the signal and mitigate backgrounds, based on "reverse tracking" dimuon pairs in the FASER$\nu$2 detector. We also discuss prospects for constraining beyond Standard Model contributions to neutrino trident rates at high energies.</description>

      <title>Future 21cm constraints on dark matter energy injection: Application to ALPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The redshifted 21cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn is expected to provide unprecedented insights into early Universe astrophysics and cosmology. Here, we briefly summarize how decaying dark matter can heat the intergalactic medium before the first galaxies, leaving a distinctive imprint on the 21cm power spectrum. We discuss the first Fisher matrix forecasts on the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array telescope (HERA) and argue that HERA can improve by up to three orders of magnitude previous cosmology constraints. In these proceedings, we project these future bounds in the plane of the Axion like particles (ALP) coupling to photons as a function of the ALP mass. We focus on the ALP mass range between $\sim$ 10 keV and 1 MeV where the 21cm signal power spectrum probes are expected to improve on any other current dark matter searches. This illustrates how 21cm cosmology can be expected to help in probing uncharted regions of the dark matter parameter space beyond the reach of existing astro-particle and cosmology experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the Universe is impressively well described by a cosmological constant. However, the observed value of the cosmological constant is much smaller than expected based on quantum field theories. Recent efforts to achieve consistency in these theories have proposed a relationship between Dark Energy and the most compact objects, such as black holes (BH). However, experimental tests are very challenging to devise and perform. In this article, we present a testable model with no cosmological constant, in which the accelerated expansion can be driven by black holes. The model couples the expansion of the Universe (the Friedmann equation) with the mass-function of cosmological haloes (using the Press-Schechter formalism). Through the observed link between halo-masses and BH-masses one thus gets a coupling between the expansion rate of the Universe and the BHs. We compare the predictions of this simple BH model with SN1a data and find a poor agreement with observations. Our method is sufficiently general that it allows us to also test a fundamentally different model, also without a cosmological constant, where the accelerated expansion is driven by a new force proportional to the internal velocity dispersion of galaxies. Surprisingly enough this model cannot be excluded using the SN1a data.</description>

      <title>Meso-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking with non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a realization of the inflationary scenario where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation, facilitated by its non-minimal coupling to gravity. This results in effectively two-field inflation: the early stage is driven by an inflaton field with the PQ symmetry intact, and the later stage is driven by the PQ scalar after its effective mass becomes tachyonic, causing destabilization from the origin. The non-minimal coupling serves the dual purpose of restoring the PQ symmetry during early inflation and flattening the PQ potential post-tachyonic shift, allowing for continued slow roll. We analyze the inflationary background solutions and scalar perturbations, which are amplified at small scales via significant isocurvature perturbations generated near the symmetry-breaking epoch. These perturbations lead to second-order gravitational waves, detectable by next-generation space-based experiments.</description>

Abstract: We search for excited charmed baryons in the $\Lambda_c^+\eta$ system using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 980 $\rm fb^{-1}$. The data were collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^{+}$$e^{-}$ asymmetric-energy collider. No significant signals are found in the $\Lambda_c^+\eta$ mass spectrum, including the known $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$. Clear $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ signals are observed in the $pD^0$ mass spectrum. We set upper limits at 90\% credibility level on ratios of branching fractions of $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ decaying to $\Lambda_c^+\eta$ relative to $\Sigma_c(2455)\pi$ of $&lt;0.13$ for the $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $&lt;1.11$ for the $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$. We measure ratios of branching fractions of $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ decaying to $pD^0$ relative to $\Sigma_c(2455)\pi$ of $0.75 \pm 0.03(\text{stat.}) \pm 0.07(\text{syst.})$ for the $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $3.59 \pm 0.21(\text{stat.}) \pm 0.56(\text{syst.})$ for the $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$.</description>

      <title>Impact of reactor neutrino uncertainties on coherent scattering's discovery potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear power reactors are the most intense man-made source of antineutrino's and have long been recognized as promising sources for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) studies. Its observation and the spectral shape of the associated recoil spectrum is sensitive to a variety of exotic new physics scenarios and many experimental efforts are underway. Within the context of the reactor antineutrino anomaly, which initially indicated eV-scale sterile neutrino's, the modeling of the reactor antineutrino spectrum has seen a significant evolution in the last decade. Even so, uncertainties remain due to a variety of nuclear structure effects, incomplete information in nuclear databases and fission dynamics complexities. Here, we investigate the effects of these uncertainties on one's ability to accurately distinguish new physics signals. For the scenarios discussed here, we find that reactor spectral uncertainties are similar in magnitude to the projected sensitivities pointing towards a need for $\beta$ spectroscopy measurements below the inverse $\beta$ decay threshold.</description>

      <title>Integrated Study of X-ray Spectrum and Time Lags for HBL Mrk 421 within the Framework of the Multiple-Zone Leptonic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the timing analysis of 10 archived \XMM observations with an exposure of $&gt;40$ ks of Markarian 421. Mrk 421 is the brightest high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object (HBL) emitting in X-rays produced by electrons accelerated in the innermost regions of a relativistic jet pointing toward us. For each observation, we construct averaged X-ray spectra in 0.5--10 keV band, as well as 100 s binned light curves (LCs) in various subbands. During these observations, the source exhibited various intensity states differing by close to an order of magnitude in flux, with the fractional variability amplitude increasing with energy through the X-ray band. Bayesian power spectral density analysis reveals that the X-ray variability can be characterized by a colored noise, with an index ranging from $\sim-1.9$ to $-3.0$. Moreover, both the standard cross-correlation function and cross-spectral methods indicate that the amount of time lags increases with the energy difference between two compared LCs. A time-dependent two-zone jet model is developed to extract physical information from the X-ray emission of Mrk 421. In the model, we assume that the jet emission mostly comprises a quasi-stationary component and a highly variable one. Our results show that the two-zone model can simultaneously provide a satisfactory description for both the X-ray spectra and time lags observed in different epochs, with the model parameters constrained in a fully acceptable interval. We suggest that shocks within the jets may be the primary energy dissipation process responsible for triggering the rapid variability, although magnetic reconnection cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>Brane Profiles of Non-Supersymmetric Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We connect the indications of 2D CFT for branes in non-supersymmetric strings to actual spacetime profiles, taking the bulk tadpole potentials into account. We find exact solutions for the uncharged branes that spread in the internal intervals of Dudas-Mourad vacua for non-tachyonic orientifolds and heterotic strings. These solutions involve suitable dressings of the uncharged branes of the nine-dimensional tadpole-free theory. Similar exact results for uncharged branes that are transverse to the internal space, or for charged branes, appear more challenging. Nevertheless, we identify their large-distance behavior, which is determined by linearized equations, and show that it is compatible with the CFT analysis in all expected cases. We also draw some indications on the leading back-reaction of the form-fields.</description>

      <title>Scale setting and hadronic properties in light quark sector with $(2+1)$-flavor Wilson fermions at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>New mechanism for primordial black hole formation from the QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new mechanism for the primordial black hole (PBH) production within the QCD axion framework. We take the case where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaks during inflation, resulting in a $N_{\rm DW}=1$ string-wall network that re-enters horizon sufficiently late. Therefore, closed axion domain walls naturally arising in the network are sufficiently large to collapse into PBHs. Our numerical simulation shows that $\sim 0.3\%$ of the total wall area is in the form of closed walls. In addition, the relic abundance of dark matter is dominantly accounted for by free axions from the collapse of open walls bounded by strings. In this framework, the abundance of PBH within dark matter is calculated to be $\sim 0.9\%$. This fraction remains unaffected by axion parameters or the re-entering horizon temperature, as it is determined by the fixed proportion of closed walls in the network, governed by the principles of percolation theory. The resultant PBHs uniformly share the same mass, which spans from about $10^{-9}$ to $1$ solar mass, corresponding to the classical QCD axion mass window $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$~eV and the re-entering horizon temperature $300-1$~MeV. Intriguingly, PBHs in this mechanism can naturally account for the ultrashort-timescale gravitational microlensing events observed by the OGLE collaboration.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray dark matter confronted by constraints on new light mediators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detectability of light dark matter in direct detection experiments is limited by the small kinetic energy of the recoiling targets. Thus, scenarios where dark matter is boosted to relativistic velocities provide a useful tactic to constrain sub-GeV dark matter particles. Of the possible dark matter boosting mechanisms, cosmic-ray upscattering is an appealing paradigm as it doesn't require any additional assumptions beyond dark matter coupling to nucleons or electrons. However, detectable signals are obtained only with relatively large cross sections which, in turn, can only be realized with large couplings, light mediators or composite dark matter. In this work we consider a general set of light mediators that couple dark matter to hadrons. Using data from Borexino, XENON1T, LZ and Super-K, we show that existing constraints on such mediators preclude appreciable cosmic-ray dark matter upscattering. This finding highlights the limited applicability of cosmic-ray upscattering constraints and suggests they only be used in model-dependent studies.</description>

      <title>Impact of scalar NSI on the neutrino mass ordering sensitivity at DUNE, HK and KNO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) is a well-motivated phenomenological scenario to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The possible scalar coupling of neutrinos ($\nu$) with matter is one of such new physics scenarios which appears as a sub-dominant effect that can impact the $\nu$-oscillations in matter. The presence of scalar NSI introduces an additional contribution directly to the $\nu$-mass matrix in the interaction Hamiltonian and subsequently to the $\nu$-oscillations. This indicates that scalar NSI may have a significant impact on measurements related to $\nu$-oscillations e.g. leptonic CP phase $(\delta_{CP})$, $\theta_{23}$ octant and neutrino mass hierarchy (MH). The linear scaling of the effects of scalar NSI with matter density also motivates its exploration in long-baseline (LBL) experiments. In this paper, we study the impact of a scalar-mediated NSI on the MH sensitivity of DUNE, T2HK and T2HKK, which are upcoming LBL experiments. We observe that the MH sensitivities of these experiments are affected by scalar NSI. For certain chosen values of scalar NSI elements, we note an enhancement in the standard MH sensitivities. We then combine the data from DUNE with T2HK/T2HKK to explore possible synergy among these experiments in a wider parameter space. We also observe a significant enhancement in the MH sensitivities for the combined analysis.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gluon Distribution for Quarkonium Dynamics in Strongly Coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generalized gluon distribution that governs the dynamics of quarkonium inside a non-Abelian thermal plasma characterizing its dissociation and recombination rates. This gluon distribution can be written in terms of a correlation function of two chromoelectric fields connected by an adjoint Wilson line. We formulate and calculate this object in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling using the AdS/CFT correspondence, allowing for a nonzero center-of-mass velocity $v$ of the heavy quark pair relative to the medium. The effect of a moving medium on the dynamics of the heavy quark pair is described by the simple substitution $T \to \sqrt{\gamma} \, T$ in agreement with previous calculations of other observables at strong coupling, where $T$ is the temperature of the plasma in its rest frame, and $\gamma = (1 - v^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz boost factor. Such a velocity dependence can be important when the quarkonium momentum is larger than its mass. Contrary to general expectations for open quantum systems weakly coupled with large thermal environments, the contributions to the transition rates that are usually thought of as the leading ones in Markovian descriptions vanish in this strongly coupled plasma. This calls for new theoretical developments to assess the effects of strongly coupled non-Abelian plasmas on in-medium quarkonium dynamics. Finally, we compare our results with those from weakly coupled QCD, and find that the QCD result moves toward the $\mathcal{N}=4$ strongly coupled result as the coupling constant is increased within the regime of applicability of perturbation theory. This behavior makes it even more pressing to develop a non-Markovian description of quarkonium in-medium dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Using unitarity, unlike the approaches available in the literature, we have constructed 9 independent representations of CKM matrix starting with each of the 9 elements of the matrix. The relationship of these independently constructed representations with the already available ones in the literature has been compared and discussed. Further, the implications of these representations have been explored for some of the CKM parameters such as \delta, J and \epsilon_k. Interestingly, we find that the PDG representation which is equivalent to our first representation seems to be most appropriate to incorporate the hierarchy of the elements of the CKM matrix as well as to describe the related phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: The anomalies observed in the $W$ mass measurements at the CDF-II experiments and the excesses seen around 95~GeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) motivate this work, in which we investigate and constrain the parameter space of the Scale Invariant Scotogenic Model with a Majorana dark matter candidate. The scanned parameters are chosen to be consistent with the dark matter relic density and the observed excesses at $\sim95$~GeV signal strength rates in different channels. We found that significant part of the viable space addresses the excess in the channel $\gamma\gamma$, while a tight part can address the excess in both $\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar{b}$ channels. Furthermore, the model's viable parameters can be probed in both the LHC and future $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders for di-Higgs production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exclusive semi-leptonic decay stands as a pivotal channel in the exploration of heavy flavor physics, primarily due to its straightforward experimental measurability. In this work, we delve into the hadron matrix element and hadron tensor within the context of exclusive semi-leptonic decays. We challenge the conventional exclusive decay theory by introducing a fresh perspective, revealing that while the baryon sector is consistent, the meson sector warrants revision. Employing a novel form factor derived from the Taylor series expansion in our differential width calculations, we demonstrate that fitting experimental data necessitates a more streamlined and minimal parameter set compared to the standard Light Cone Sun Rul(LCSR) form factors. Furthermore, we propose that our hypothesis can be empirically validated or refuted through the precise measurement of the double differential decay width, offering a tangible path forward for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Observability of CMB spectrum distortions from dark matter annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even after dark matter chemically freezes out in the early universe, electromagnetic cascades from dark matter annihilation can still perturb the background photon spectrum when the universe temperature cools down to 0.5 keV. We revisit the CMB spectrum distortions caused by $s$-wave dark matter annihilation under the updated Planck data and the future CMB sensitivity, concluding that $s$-wave annihilation cannot create observable distortions under forecast sensitivities of the (Super-)PIXIE missions. We further detail the case of $p$-wave dark matter annihilation, demonstrating the observability of the primordial $\mu$-distortion. Taking current constraints from primordial light elements, structure formations, cosmic electron-positron rays, and gamma rays, we find that the $\mu$-distortion reaching the observational limit as large as $\mu\simeq 3\times 10^{-8}$ can only be realized with a dark matter mass at 10--50 MeV and a kinetic decoupling temperature around 1 keV. The upper bound of the $p$-wave annihilation cross section can be strengthened by an order of magnitude if the $\mu$-distortion is not detected.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the complete soft-gluon corrections for the production of colorless final states through N$^3$LO in single-particle-inclusive kinematics. We present explicit analytical results and use them to study higher-order QCD corrections for the production of a heavy charged Higgs pair ($H^+ H^-$) via quark-antiquark annihilation in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model at LHC energies. We calculate the NNLO soft-gluon and virtual QCD corrections as well as the N$^3$LO soft-gluon corrections to the total cross section and the charged-Higgs rapidity distribution. This is the first calculation of complete N$^3$LO soft-gluon corrections for a process in single-particle-inclusive kinematics, and the results can be applied to other processes with colorless final states.</description>

Abstract: Inclusive production processes will be important for the first observations of $XYZ$ states at new generation electron-hadron colliders, as they generally benefit from larger cross sections than their exclusive counterparts. We make predictions of semi-inclusive photoproduction of the $\chi_{c1}(1P)$ and $X(3872)$, whose peripheral production is assumed to be dominated by vector exchanges. We validate the applicability of Vector Meson Dominance in the axial-vector charmonium sector and calculate production rates at center-of-mass energies relevant for future experimental facilities. We find the semi-inclusive cross sections near threshold to be enhanced by a factor of $\sim 2-3$ compared to the exclusive reaction and well suited for a first observation in photoproduction.</description>

      <title>Determination of $K^0_S$ Fragmentation Functions including BESIII Measurements and using Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the extraction of parton-to-$K^0_S$ hadron fragmentation functions, named FF24-$K^0_S$, focusing on both next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order accuracy in perturbative QCD. Our approach involves the analysis of single inclusive electron-positron annihilation (SIA) data. The two key improvements are, on the one hand, the incorporation of the latest experimental data from the BESIII experiment and, on the other hand, the adoption of Neural Networks in the fitting procedure. To address experimental uncertainties, the Monte Carlo method is employed. Our investigation also explores the impact of hadron mass corrections on the description of SIA data, spanning a broad kinematic regime with a particular emphasis on the range of small $z$ values. The theory prediction for $K^0_S$ production at both NLO and NNLO accuracy exhibits good agreement with experimental data within their respective uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark mass near the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming that the number densities of heavy flavor in hadron gas and in QGP are same at $T_c$, we obtain the effective mass of heavy quark at $T_c$ from the comparison with the hadron resonance gas model which well describes particle yield in heavy-ion collisions. We find that charm quark mass at vanishing baryon chemical potential is around 1.8 GeV which is much heavier than QCD bare mass and close to $D$ meson mass. The mass slightly increases with increasing baryon chemical potential and then decreases. On the other hand, anticharm quark mass constantly decreases with increasing baryon chemical potential. Bottom quark mass has a similar pattern. Extending the hadron resonance gas model to a bit higher temperature beyond $T_c$, the effective masses of charm and bottom quarks decrease with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Study of the transverse momentum distribution of transport models of kaon, Pion, and (anti-)proton production in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV</title>

Abstract: In this study, the transverse momentum spectra of $k ^{\pm }$, $\pi ^{\pm }$ and $p(\bar{p})$ particles in mid-rapidity ($\left | y \right | &lt; 0.1$) for nine centrality classes are investigated in $^{238} U$+$^{238} U$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=193 GeV within the cascade and soft momentum-dependent equation of state (SM-EoS) mode of the UrQMD model. Other extracted observable from $p_{T}$ spectrum includes average transverse momentum ($\left \langle p_{T} \right \rangle$), the yield ($dN/dy$) as well as the ratio of particle type are also shown in function of collision centrality. It is found that the U+U collision process is segmented. Before the collision centrality is $50-60\%$, the experimental data are described well using cascade mode when the $p_{T} &lt; 1.2 GeV/c$. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data using the SM-EoS mode at $p_{T} &gt; 1.2 GeV/c$. For the case of $60-80\%$ centrality, the SM-EoS mode describes the data better. At RHIC energy, pair production is the dominant production mechanism for particles, with the anti-ion to ion yield ratio suggesting.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Dark Fermion Mass using Multicritical-Point Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to determine the effective potential using the multicritical-point principle (MPP) under the additional scalar field. The MPP is applied to the model in which a singlet dark fermion and a singlet real scalar field are added to the Standard Model (SM) to predict the dark fermion mass. As a result, the dark fermion mass is predicted to be about $866$--$937$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wu-Yang fiber bundle approach to magnetic charge is extended with a disk-like sheet current density and associated magnetic field in the overlap region between the Northern hemisphere and Southern hemisphere, where the different vector potentials connect. This disk magnetic field plays a role similar to the Dirac string in the Dirac approach to magnetic charge - it brings an inward magnetic flux of $4 \pi g$ which then gives rise to an outward Coulomb magnetic flux of $4 \pi g$. As with the Dirac string approach we show that placing an electric charge near this disk magnetic field gives rise to a non-zero electromagnetic field momentum. We discuss some of the possible physical consequences of this electromagnetic field momentum. We conclude by showing that the non-singular, but non-single valued Banderet monopole potential also has a disk-like magnetic flux and non-zero electromagnetic field momentum in the presence of an electric charge.</description>

      <title>CMB constraints on inflection-point inflation with a pseudo-scalar dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the physical aspects of the inflection-point inflation scenario and assess its observational viability in light of current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. The model we consider encapsulates the inflaton with a pseudo-scalar (the dark matter candidate) in a complex neutral scalar singlet. The cosmological constraints on the parameters of inflation derived at a high energy scale are translated to a low energy scale by running these parameters. Ensuring the entire Lagrangian to be invariant under a $Z_3$ symmetry with the adequate transformation of the fields, the imaginary part of the singlet decouples from the other scalars of the model. We then investigate if the observational viability of inflation is also compatible with this pseudo-scalar being the dark matter component.We show that the CMB constraints on the inflationary parameters assure that the pseudo-scalar is stable and provides the correct relic dark matter abundance only when the pseudo-scalar is thermally produced.</description>

      <title>Localization of scalar field on the brane-world by coupling with gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a coupling mechanism between the kinetic term and the gravity, in which a coupling function $F(R)$ is introduced into the kinetic term of the five-dimensional scalar field. Based on this scenario, we investigate the localization of scalar fields in three specific braneworld models: the Minkowski brane, the de Sitter brane, and the Anti-de Sitter brane. The brane models considered here are regular with no singularity for scalar curvature. For the Minkowshi brane case, the zero mode can always be localized on the brane, and the massive modes can be localized or quasi-localized on the brane. For the dS$_4$ brane case, two forms of factor $F(R)$ is considered. The zero mode can always be localized, and the massive modes could be quasi-localized on the brane. Besides, with the second coupling factor, the scalar zero mode could be localized on the both sides of the origin of extra dimension, while the massive modes could be quasi-localized on the origin. Lastly, for the AdS$_4$ brane case, the localization of the scalar zero mode requires the consideration of a coupling potential $V(\Phi,\varphi)$, while the massive modes can still be localized on the brane with an infinite number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of a hadron encode fundamental aspects of its structure, including its shape and size as defined from e.g., its energy density. This work presents a determination of the flavor decomposition of the GFFs of the proton from lattice QCD, in the kinematic region $0\leq -t\leq 2~\text{GeV}^2$. The decomposition into up-, down-, strange-quark, and gluon contributions provides first-principles constraints on the role of each constituent in generating key proton structure observables, such as its mechanical radius, mass radius, and $D$-term.</description>

      <title>Casimir Energy Stabilization of Standard Model Landscape in Dark Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a realization of dark dimension. We consider the 5D standard model coupling to gravity with one dimension compactified on an orbifold, which is seen as dark dimension of size R. We stabilize the radion by casimir effect wrapping around compact dimension and recover the neutrino mass and 4D cosmological constant with the observed value. Orbifold can lead to a natural resolution of chirality problem in 5D at low energy, which we briefly discussed in the paper. Although we found that the radion mass is too light to survive under solar system tests of GR, several screening mechanisms might give us a solution, for example, Chameleon mechanism.</description>

      <title>Possible Impact of non-Gaussianities on cosmological constraints in neutrino physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for non-Gaussian signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is crucial for understanding the physics of the early Universe. Given the possibility of non-Gaussian fluctuations in the CMB, a recent revision to the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been proposed, dubbed "Super-$\Lambda$CDM". This model introduces additional free parameters to account for the potential effects of a trispectrum in the primordial fluctuations. In this study, we explore the impact of the Super-$\Lambda$CDM model on current constraints on neutrino physics. In agreement with previous research, our analysis reveals that for most of the datasets, the Super-$\Lambda$CDM parameter $A_0$ significantly deviates from zero at over a $95\%$ confidence level. We then demonstrate that this signal might influence current constraints in the neutrino sector. Specifically, we find that the current constraints on neutrino masses may be relaxed by over a factor of two within the Super-$\Lambda$CDM framework, thanks to the correlation present with $A_0$. Consequently, locking $A_0=0$ might introduce a bias, leading to overly stringent constraints on the total neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Global Portraits of Nonminimal Inflation: Metric and Palatini</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global phase space dynamics of single nonminimally coupled scalar field inflation models in the metric and Palatini formalisms. Working in the Jordan frame, we derive the scalar-tensor general field equations and flat FLRW cosmological equations, and present the Palatini and metric equations in a common framework. We show that inflation is characterized by a "master" trajectory from a saddle-type de Sitter fixed point to a stable node fixed point, approximated by slow roll conditions (presented for the first time in the Palatini formalism). We show that, despite different underlying equations, the fixed point structure and properties of many models are congruent in metric and Palatini, which explains their qualitative similarities and their suitability for driving inflation. On the other hand, the global phase portraits reveal how even models which predict the same values for observable perturbations differ, both to the extent of the phase space physically available to their trajectories, as well as their past asymptotic states. We also note how the slow roll conditions tend to underestimate the end of inflationary accelerated expansion experienced by the true nonlinear "master" solution. The explicit examples we consider range from the metric and Palatini induced gravity quintic potential with a Coleman-Weinberg correction factor to Starobinsky, metric and Palatini nonminimal Higgs, second order pole, and several nontrivial Palatini models.</description>

      <title>Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields. We comment briefly on potential upgrades to four dimensions and other future directions.</description>

      <title>Microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud based on 20 years of OGLE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) can be used to probe the distribution and mass function of compact objects in the direction toward that galaxy - in the Milky Way disk, the Milky Way dark matter halo, and the LMC itself. The previous measurements, based on small statistical samples of events, found that the optical depth is an order of magnitude smaller than that expected from the entire dark matter halo in the form of compact objects. However, these previous studies were not sensitive to long-duration events with Einstein timescales longer than 2.5-3 yr, which are expected from massive ($10-100\,M_{\odot}$) and intermediate-mass ($10^2-10^5\,M_{\odot}$) black holes. Such events would have been missed by the previous studies and would not have been taken into account in calculations of the optical depth. Here, we present the analysis of nearly 20-year-long photometric monitoring of 78.7 million stars in the LMC by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 through 2020. We describe the observing setup, the construction of the 20-year OGLE dataset, the methods used for searching for microlensing events in the light-curve data, and the calculation of the event detection efficiency. In total, we find 16 microlensing events (thirteen using an automated pipeline and three with manual searches), all of which have timescales shorter than 1 yr. We use a sample of thirteen events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC $\tau=(0.121 \pm 0.037)\times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma=(0.74 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. These numbers are consistent with lensing by stars in the Milky Way disk and the LMC itself, and they demonstrate that massive and intermediate-mass black holes cannot comprise a significant fraction of the dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model of particle physics predicts the speed of light to be a universal speed of propagation of massless carriers. However, other possibilities exist -- including Lorentz-violating theories -- where different fundamental fields travel at different speeds. Black holes are interesting probes of such physics, as distinct fields would probe different horizons. Here, we build an exact spacetime for two interacting scalar fields which have different propagation speeds. One of these fields is able to probe the black hole interior of the other, giving rise to energy extraction from the black hole and a characteristic late-time relaxation. Our results provide further stimulus to the search for extra degrees of freedom, black hole instability, and extra ringdown modes in gravitational-wave events.</description>

      <title>First constraints on the $L_\mu-L_\tau$ explanation of the muon $g-2$ anomaly from NA64-$e$ at CERN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06982v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of an additional $U(1)$ gauge $L_\mu-L_\tau$ symmetry would release the tension between the measured and the predicted value of the anomalous muon magnetic moment: this paradigm assumes the existence of a new, light $Z^\prime$ vector boson, with dominant coupling to $\mu$ and $\tau$ leptons and interacting with electrons via a loop mechanism. The $L_\mu-L_\tau$ model can also explain the Dark Matter relic abundance, by assuming that the $Z'$ boson acts as a ``portal'' to a new Dark Sector of particles in Nature, not charged under known interactions. In this work we present the results of the $Z'$ search performed by the NA64-$e$ experiment at CERN SPS, that collected $\sim 9\times10^{11}$ 100 GeV electrons impinging on an active thick target. Despite the suppressed $Z'$ production yield with an electron beam, NA64-$e$ provides the first accelerator-based results excluding the $g-2$ preferred band of the $Z'$ parameter space in the 1 keV $ &lt; m_{Z'} \lesssim 2$ MeV range, in complementarity with the limits recently obtained by the NA64-$\mu$ experiment with a muon beam.</description>

Abstract: We propose a particle production mechanism analogous to the particle photoproduction processes, arising from the gluon-nucleon interactions in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The comparison is made on the effect of the gluon-nucleon interactions on the photon production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV. The numerical results indicate that as the collision energy increases, the contribution of gluon-nucleon interactions becomes more prominent.</description>

      <title>$n\pi$ phase ambiguity of cosmic birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the rotation angle $\beta$ of cosmic birefringence, which is a recently reported parity-violating signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), has a phase ambiguity of $n\pi \,(n\in\mathbb{Z})$. This ambiguity has a significant impact on the interpretation of the origin of cosmic birefringence. Assuming an axion-like particle as the origin of cosmic birefringence, this ambiguity can be partly broken by the anisotropic cosmic birefringence and the shape of the CMB angular power spectra. We also discuss constraints on $\beta$ from existing experimental results.</description>

      <title>Study of hybrid stars with nonstrange quark matter cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03211</link>

Abstract: In this work, under the hypothesis that quark matter may not be strange [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 222001 (2018)], we adopt a modification of the coupling constant of the four-quark scalar interaction $G\rightarrow G_1+G_2\langle\bar{\psi}\psi\rangle$ in the 2-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model to study nonstrange hybrid stars. According to lattice QCD simulation results of the critical temperature at zero chemical potential, $G_1$ and $G_2$ are constrained as $G_1\in(1.935, 1.972)$ GeV$^{-2}$, and $G_2\in(-1.582, -0.743)$ GeV$^{-5}$, respectively. To obtain hybrid equation of states, the Maxwell construction is used to describe the first-order confinement-deconfinement phase transition in hybrid stars. With recent measurements on neutron star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, the hybrid equation of states are constrained. The result suggests that pure nonstrange quark matter cores can exist in hybrid stars, possessing 0.014-0.026 solar mass with the bag constant $B^{1/4}$ in a range of 148-161 MeV. It is argued that the binary neutron stars in GW170817 should be hadron stars.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic isovector form factors of the transition from the $N^*(1520)$ to the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dispersion theory is used to provide a model-independent low-energy representation of the three electromagnetic isovector transition form factors $N^{*}(1520)\to N$. At low energies the virtual photon couples dominantly to a pion pair. Taking the very well understood pion vector form factor and pion re-scattering into consideration, the determination of the transition form factors is traced back to the determination of pion-baryon scattering amplitudes. Their low-energy aspects are parametrized by baryon exchange, accounting for the main decay channels of the $N^*(1520)$. Short-distance physics is encoded in subtraction constants that are fitted to data on space-like form factors and hadronic decays. It is shown that a limitation in the determination of the subtraction constants lies in the fact that isovector form factors require sufficient information about the differences between protons and neutrons. In particular, this calls for improvements in the form factor extraction from the electroproduction of the $N^*(1520)$ on the neutron. Via the dispersion relations, space- and time-like regions are naturally connected from first principles. This allows to predict the time-like form factors that enter the Dalitz decays $N^*(1520)\to N e^- e^+$ and $N^*(1520)\to N \mu^- \mu^+$. Under the assumption of the dominance of the isovector over the isoscalar channel, the Dalitz decay distributions are predicted.</description>
