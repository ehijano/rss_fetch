      <title>Tutorial: Current controllers for optimizing laser cooling on cold atom experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of single chip current source based on a common power operational amplifier is presented and demonstrated for the purpose of controlling applied magnetic fields using bias/shim electromagnets in cold atom experiments. The efficacy of the design is realized via application to red-detuned polarization-gradient cooling of $^{87}$Rb down to 3 $\mu$K. Further, we demonstrate Raman spectroscopy using these devices to apply current and so generate a precise, accurate, and reproducible magnetic field. This work is intended as a short tutorial for new graduate students and postdocs of laser cooling and trapping.</description>

      <title>Combined microwave and optical spectroscopy for hyperfine structure analysis in thulium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hyperfine structure of atoms and ions is widely used in fundamental and applied research. Accurate knowledge of hyperfine splitting values is essential for quantum metrology applications as well as for improving the performance of systems designed for quantum computing and simulation. We present refined values of the hyperfine splitting frequencies of the ground and clock states of thulium atom, $f_{g}^\textrm{HFS}=1\,496\,550\,658.23(3)$\,Hz and $f_{c}^\textrm{HFS}=2\,113\,946\,873.08(9)$\,Hz, respectively. The measurements are performed on an ultracold atomic ensemble in an optical lattice using combined microwave and optical transition spectroscopy. Our results improve the accuracy by 2 and 7 orders of magnitude for $f_{g}^\textrm{HFS}$ and $f_{c}^\textrm{HFS}$, respectively, compared to the previously published values. We also refine the value of the Land\'e g-factor of the clock level to $g_c = 0.85479(11)$.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum theory on curved space-time with quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies present new opportunities for fundamental tests of nature. One potential application is to probe the interplay between quantum physics and general relativity - a field of physics with no empirical evidence yet. Here we show that quantum networks open a new window to test this interface. We demonstrate how photon mediated entanglement between atomic or atom-like systems can be used to probe time-dilation induced entanglement and interference modulation. Key are non-local measurements between clocks in a gravitational field, which can be achieved either through direct photon interference or by using auxiliary entanglement. The resulting observable depends on the interference between different proper times, and can only be explained if both quantum theory and general relativity are taken into account. The proposed protocol enables clock interferometry on km-scale separations and beyond. Our work thus shows a realistic experimental route for a first test of quantum theory on curved space-time, opening up new scientific opportunities for quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected quantized changes of the distance between atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thouless pumping enables the transport of particles in a one-dimensional periodic potential if the potential is slowly and periodically modulated in time. The change in the position of particles after each modulation period is quantized and depends solely on the topology of the pump cycle, making it robust against perturbations. Here, we demonstrate that Thouless pumping also allows for the realization of topologically protected quantized changes of the distance between atoms if the atomic s-wave scattering length is properly modulated in time.</description>

      <title>Tessellated phase diagram and extended criticality in driven quasicrystals and quantum Hall matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point, as well as induce Floquet topological insulators. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Collinear three-photon excitation of a strongly forbidden optical clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ${{^1\mathrm{S}_0}\!-\!{^3\mathrm{P}_0}}$ clock transition in strontium serves as the foundation for the world's best atomic clocks and for gravitational wave detector concepts in clock atom interferometry. This transition is weakly allowed in the fermionic isotope $^{87}$Sr but strongly forbidden in bosonic isotopes. Here we demonstrate coherent excitation of the clock transition in bosonic ${}^{88}$Sr using a novel collinear three-photon process in a weak magnetic field. We observe Rabi oscillations with frequencies of up to $50~\text{kHz}$ using $\text{W}/\text{cm}^{2}$ laser intensities and Gauss-level magnetic field amplitudes. The absence of nuclear spin in bosonic isotopes offers decreased sensitivity to magnetic fields and optical lattice light shifts, enabling atomic clocks with reduced systematic errors. The collinear propagation of the laser fields permits the interrogation of spatially separated atomic ensembles with common laser pulses, a key requirement for dark matter searches and gravitational wave detection with next-generation quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Hidden orders and phase transitions for the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum loop and dimer models are prototypical correlated systems with local constraints, which are not only intimately connected to lattice gauge theories and topological orders but are also widely applicable to the broad research areas of quantum materials and quantum simulation. Employing our sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, we reveal the complete phase diagram of the triangular-lattice fully packed quantum loop model. Apart from the known lattice nematic (LN) solid and the even $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases, we discover a hidden vison plaquette (VP) phase, which had been overlooked and misinterpreted as a QSL for more than a decade. Moreover, the VP-to-QSL continuous transition belongs to the $(2+1)$D cubic* universality class, which offers a lattice realization of the (fractionalized) cubic fixed point that had long been considered as irrelevant towards the O($3$) symmetry until corrected recently by conformal bootstrap calculations. Our results are therefore of relevance to recent developments in both experiments and theory, and facilitate further investigations of hidden phases and transitions.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Floquet dynamics in absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>
