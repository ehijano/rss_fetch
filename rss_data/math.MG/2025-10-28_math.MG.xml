      <title>On $2n+4$ normals conjecture for convex polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for $n&gt;3$ each generic simple polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ contains a point with at least $2n+4$ emanating normals to the boundary.
  This result is a piecewise-linear counterpart of a long-standing problem about normals to smooth convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the Euclidean ball by polytopes with a fixed number of $k$-faces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive lower estimates for the approximation of the $d$-dimensional Euclidean ball by polytopes with a fixed number of $k$-dimensional faces, $k\in\{0,1,\ldots,d-1\}$. The metrics considered include the intrinsic volume difference and the Hausdorff metric. In the case of inscribed and circumscribed polytopes, our main results extend the previously obtained bounds from $k=0$ and $k=d-1$, respectively, to half of the $f$-vector of the approximating polytope. For arbitrarily positioned polytopes, we also improve a special case of a result of K. J. B\"or\"oczky ({\it J. Approx. Theory}, 2000) by a factor of dimension. This paper addresses a question of P. M. Gruber ({\it Convex and Discrete Geometry}, p. 216), who asked for results on the approximation of convex bodies by polytopes with a fixed number of $k$-faces when $1\leq k\leq d-2$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Bounds for Sorting-Based Permutation-Invariant Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X \mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly, the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly, no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps. Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.</description>

      <title>Triangle unions with maximal number of sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the following problem is addressed. Given an integer n&gt;=1. Suppose, a simple polygon is a union of n triangles. What is the maximal number of sides it can have? This is a sequence A375986, a recent entry into the OEIS. It starts as 3, 12, 22, and most likely continues as 33, 44, 55, 67, 79. We give upper and lower bounds for this sequence and present evidence showing that needed configurations are quite delicate.</description>

      <title>Geometric embeddings of spaces of persistence diagrams with explicit distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a positive integer. We provide an explicit geometrically motivated $1$-Lipschitz map from the space of persistence diagrams on $n$ points (equipped with the Bottleneck distance) into the Hilbert space $\ell^2$. Such maps are a crucial step in topological data analysis, allowing the use of statistical methods (and thus data analysis) on collections of persistence diagrams. The main advantage of our maps as compared to most of the other such vectorizations is that they are coarse and uniform embeddings with explicit distortion functions. This allows us to control the amount of geometric information lost through their application. Furthermore, we also provide an explicit $1$-Lipschitz map from the space of persistence diagrams on $n$ points on a bounded domain into a Euclidean space with an explicit distortion function. We conclude with a differently flavored embedding of the space of persistence diagrams on $n$ points on a bounded domain into $\mathbb{R}^{n(n+1)}$.
  The maps we construct are fairly simple, with each component depending only on the bottleneck distance to the corresponding ``landmark" persistence diagram. Due to geometric motivation from classical dimension theory, our methods are best described as quantitative dimension theory.</description>

      <title>Geometric Convergence to an Extreme Limit Space with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2014, Gromov conjectured that sequences of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature should have subsequences which converge in some geometric sense to limit spaces with some notion of generalized nonnegative scalar curvature. In recent joint work with Changliang Wang, the authors found a sequence of warped product Riemannian metrics on $\Sph^2\times \Sph^1$ with nonnegative scalar curvature whose metric tensors converge in the $W^{1,p}$ sense for $p&lt;2$ to an extreme warped product limit space where the warping function hits infinity at two points. Here we study this extreme limit space as a metric space and as an integral current space and prove the sequence converges in the volume preserving intrinsic flat and measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense to this space. This limit space may now be used to test any proposed definitions for generalized nonnegative scalar curvature. One does not need expertise in Geometric Measure Theory or in Intrinsic Flat Convergence to read this paper.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of quantizer constants for arbitrary lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01987v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the exact computer-aided construction of the Voronoi cells of lattices with known symmetry group. Our algorithm scales better than linearly with the total number of faces and is applicable to dimensions beyond 12, which previous methods could not achieve. The new algorithm is applied to the Coxeter-Todd lattice $K_{12}$ as well as to a family of lattices obtained from laminating $K_{12}$. By optimizing this family, we obtain a new 13-dimensional lattice, whose quantizer constant is smaller than any published at the time of submission. (For subsequent improvements, see Note added in proof after the Conclusions.)</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of the geodesic flow for groups with a contracting element</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01390v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the dynamical properties of the geodesic flow for a proper metric space endowed with a proper action by isometries of a group with a contracting element. We show that the existence of a contracting isometry is a sufficient evidence of negative curvature to carry in this context various results borrowed from hyperbolic geometry. In particular, we extend the so-called Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy proving that the geodesic flow is either conservative and ergodic or dissipative.</description>

      <title>On the Global Optimality of Fibonacci Lattices in the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use linear programming bounds to analyze point sets in the torus with respect to their optimality for problems in discrepancy theory and quasi-Monte Carlo methods. These concepts will be unified by introducing tensor product energies.
  We show that the canonical $3$-point lattice in any dimension is globally optimal among all $3$-point sets in the torus with respect to a large class of such energies. This is a new instance of universal optimality, a special phenomenon that is only known for a small class of highly structured point sets.
  In the case of $d=2$ dimensions it is conjectured that so-called Fibonacci lattices should also be optimal with respect to a large class of potentials. To this end we show that the $5$-point Fibonacci lattice is globally optimal for a continuously parametrized class of potentials relevant to the analysis fo the quasi-Monte Carlo method.</description>
