      <title>Implications of shallow-shell models for topographic relaxation on icy satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Icy satellites host topography at many length scales, from rifts and craters on the small end to equatorial-pole shell thickness differences that are comparable to these bodies' circumference. The rate of topographic evolution depends on the rheology of the ice shell, the difference in density between the shell and potential global subsurface oceans, the ice shell thickness distribution, as well as the rate of tidal heat dissipation in the shell. Here we analyze relaxation of topography starting from the Stokes equations for viscous fluid flow. We write out the shallow-shell models (with and without a rigid crust) and compare the resulting time scales to previous work. Using three-dimensional linearized flow for small-amplitude topographic perturbations, we recover the time scales of relaxation from the shallow models as well as shells that are not shallow. For a shell of constant viscosity, we find that the topographic relaxation time scale is constant for wavelengths larger than the ice thickness, an idea that runs contrary to the existing paradigm. For a shell with a viscosity that decreases exponentially with depth, we show numerically that there is a regime where the larger viscosity outer crust acts as a nearly rigid boundary. In this case, the relaxation time scale depends on the wavelength. For the largest spatial scales, the time scale becomes independent of wavelength again and the value is set by the average shell viscosity. However, the spatial scale that this transition occurs at becomes larger as the viscosity contrast increases, limiting the applicability of the scale-independent relaxation rate. These results for the relaxation of topography have implications for interpreting relaxed crater profiles, inferences of ice shell thickness from topography, and upcoming observations from missions to the outer solar system.</description>

      <title>Systematic KMTNet Planetary Anomaly Search. XII. Complete Sample of 2017 Subprime Field Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the analysis of four unambiguous planets and one possible planet from the subprime fields ($\Gamma \leq 1~{\rm hr}^{-1}$) of the 2017 Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) microlensing survey, to complete the KMTNet AnomalyFinder planetary sample for the 2017 subprime fields. They are KMT-2017-BLG-0849, KMT-2017-BLG-1057, OGLE-2017-BLG-0364, and KMT-2017-BLG-2331 (unambiguous), as well as KMT-2017-BLG-0958 (possible). For the four unambiguous planets, the mean planet-host mass ratios, $q$, are $(1.0, 1.2, 4.6, 13) \times 10^{-4}$, the median planetary masses are $(6.4, 24, 76, 171)~M_{\oplus}$ and the median host masses are $(0.19, 0.57, 0.49, 0.40)~M_{\odot}$ from a Bayesian analysis. We have completed the AnomalyFinder planetary sample from the first 4-year KMTNet data (2016--2019), with 112 unambiguous planets in total, which nearly tripled the microlensing planetary sample. The ``sub-Saturn desert'' ($\log q = \left[-3.6, -3.0\right]$) found in the 2018 and 2019 KMTNet samples is confirmed by the 2016 and 2017 KMTNet samples.</description>

      <title>Microlensing events indicate that super-Earth exoplanets are common in Jupiter-like orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets classified as super-Earths are commonly observed on short period orbits, close to their host stars, but their abundance on wider orbits is poorly constrained. Gravitational microlensing is sensitive to exoplanets on wide orbits. We observed the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, which indicates an exoplanet with a planet-to-star mass ratio roughly double the Earth-Sun mass-ratio, on an orbit longer than Saturn's. We combine this event with a larger sample from a microlensing survey to determine the distribution of mass ratios for planets on wide orbits. We infer there are $\sim 0.35$ super-Earth planets per star on Jupiter-like orbits. The observations are most consistent with a bimodal distribution, with separate peaks for super-Earths and gas giants. We suggest that this reflects differences in their formation processes.</description>

      <title>Multiple Outbursts of Halley-Type Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical observations of Halley type comet 12P/Pons-Brooks on its approach to perihelion. The comet was active even in the first observations at about 8 au. Starting at 4 au, 12P exhibited an extraordinary series of outbursts, in which the brightness changed by a factor up to 100 and the coma morphology transformed under the action of radiation pressure into a distinctive ``horned'' appearance. Individual outburst dust masses are several x 1e9 kg, with kinetic energies 1e14 J, release times 1e4 s and effective power 1e10 W. These properties are most consistent with, although do not definitively establish, an origin by the crystallization of amorphous water ice with the related release of trapped supervolatile gases. This interpretation is supported by the observation that the specific outburst energy and the specific crystallization energy are comparable (both near 1e5 J kg/s.</description>

      <title>Escaping Helium and a Highly Muted Spectrum Suggest a Metal-Enriched Atmosphere on Sub-Neptune GJ3090b from JWST Transit Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes, the most common planet type, remain poorly understood. Their atmospheres are expected to be diverse, but their compositions are challenging to determine, even with JWST. Here, we present the first JWST spectroscopic study of the warm sub-Neptune GJ3090b (2.13R$_\oplus$, Teq~700 K) which orbits an M2V star, making it a favourable target for atmosphere characterization. We observed four transits of GJ3090b; two each using JWST NIRISS/SOSS and NIRSpec/G395H, yielding wavelength coverage from 0.6-5.2 $\mu$m. We detect the signature of the 10833 \r{A} metastable Helium triplet at a statistical significance of 5.5$\sigma$ with an amplitude of 434$\pm$79 ppm, marking the first such detection in a sub-Neptune with JWST. This amplitude is significantly smaller than predicted by solar-metallicity forward models, suggesting a metal-enriched atmosphere which decreases the mass-loss rate and attenuates the Helium feature amplitude. Moreover, we find that stellar contamination, in the form of the transit light source effect, dominates the NIRISS transmission spectra, with unocculted spot and faculae properties varying across the two visits separated in time by approximately six months. Free retrieval analyses on the NIRSpec/G395H spectrum find tentative evidence for highly muted features and a lack of CH4. These findings are best explained by a high metallicity atmosphere (&gt;100x solar at 3$\sigma$ confidence, for clouds at $\sim \mu$bar pressures) using chemically-consistent retrievals and self-consistent model grids. Further observations of GJ3090b are needed for tighter constraints on the atmospheric abundances, and to gain a deeper understanding of the processes that led to its potential metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric C/O Ratios of Sub-Neptunes with Magma Oceans: Homemade rather than Inherited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the James Webb Space Telescope has enabled detailed spectroscopic characterization of sub-Neptune atmospheres. With detections of carbon- and oxygen-bearing species such as CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O, a central question is whether the atmospheric C/O ratio, commonly used to trace formation location in giant planets, can serve a similar diagnostic role for sub-Neptunes. We use the global chemical equilibrium framework of Schlichting &amp; Young (2022) to quantify how magma ocean-atmosphere interactions affect the atmospheric C/O ratio. We find that the resulting C/O ratios range from several orders of magnitude below solar to a few times solar. The atmospheric C/O ratio in sub-Neptunes is therefore not inherited from the protoplanetary disk, but instead emerges from chemical equilibrium between the atmosphere and the underlying magma ocean. Planetary mass, atmospheric mass fraction, and thermal state all strongly influence the atmospheric C/O ratio. In addition, carbon partitioning into the metal phase typically reduces the atmospheric C/O ratio substantially, particularly for atmospheric mass fractions less than a few percent. Finally, we couple the deep equilibrium compositions to 1D atmospheric models that self-consistently solve for the pressure-temperature structure and chemical composition, including photochemistry. We find that the C/O ratio varies with altitude under low vertical mixing conditions (K$_\text{zz}=10^4$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), but remains constant under strong mixing (K$_\text{zz}=10^7$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$). Our results imply that observed C/O ratios of sub-Neptunes can be used to probe their interiors. Specifically, C/O ratios much lower than host star values would imply an underlying magma ocean with iron metal having sequestered significant amounts of carbon.</description>

      <title>Planets Across Space and Time (PAST). VI. Age Dependence of the Occurrence and Architecture of Ultra-Short-Period Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-short-period (USP) planets, with orbital periods shorter than one day, represent a unique class of exoplanets whose origin remains puzzling. Determining their age distribution and temporal evolution is vital for uncovering their formation and evolutionary pathways. Using a sample of over 1,000 short-period planets around Sun-like stars, we find that the host stars of USP planets are relatively older and have a higher prevalence in the Galactic thick disk compared to stars hosting other short-period planets. Furthermore, we find that the occurrence of USP planets increases with stellar age and uncover evidence indicating that USP planetary system architectures evolve on Gyr timescales. This includes a distinct dip-pileup in period distributions around ~1 day and an expansion of orbital spacings with time. In addition, younger USP planet systems are observed to have fewer multiple transiting planets, implying fewer nearby companions and/or larger mutual orbital inclinations. Our findings suggest that USP planets continuously form through inward migration driven by tidal dissipation over Gyr timescales, and that younger and older USP planets may have originated via different specific tidal migration pathways.</description>

      <title>Two neighbours to the ultra-short-period Earth-sized planet K2-157 b in the warm Neptunian savanna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of ultra-short-period (USP) planets is poorly understood. However, it is widely thought that these planets migrated inwards through interactions with outer neighbours. We aimed to confirm and characterize the USP Earth-sized planet K2-157 b ($P_{\rm orb}$ = 8.8 h). To do so, We measured 49 radial velocities (RVs) with the ESPRESSO spectrograph and derived the properties of the system through a RV and transit model. We detect two additional super-Neptune-mass planets within the warm Neptunian savanna, K2-157 c ($P_{\rm orb, c}$ = $25.942^{+0.045}_{-0.044}$ d, $M_{\rm p, c} \, \textrm{sin} \, i$ = $30.8 \pm 1.9$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$), and K2-157 d ($P_{\rm orb, d}$ = $66.50^{+0.71}_{-0.59}$ d, $M_{\rm p,d} \, \textrm{sin}\,i$ = $23.3 \pm 2.5$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$). The mass of K2-157 b, $M_{\rm p,b}$ = $1.14^{+0.39}_{-0.41}$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$ ($&lt;$ 2.3 $\rm M_{\oplus}$ at 3$\sigma$), together with its radius, $R_{\rm p}$ = 0.935 $\pm$ 0.090 $\rm R_{\oplus}$, make the planet compatible with a rocky composition. K2 data discard non-grazing transit configurations for K2-157 c ($i_{\rm c}$ $&lt;$ 88.4$^{\circ}$ at 3$\sigma$), and ESPRESSO data constrain the eccentricities of K2-157 c and K2-157 d to $e_{\rm c}$ $&lt;$ 0.2 and $e_{\rm d}$ $&lt;$ 0.5 at 3$\sigma$. At a population level, we find that the trend that the closest USP planets tend to orbit late-type stars does not hold when scaling the orbital separation to the Roche limit, which suggests that the orbital distribution of the closest planets across spectral types is determined by tidal disruption. The orbital architecture of K2-157 is unusual, with only one similar case reported to date: 55 Cnc. The USP planets of these systems, being accompanied by massive, long-period, relatively spaced, and possibly misaligned neighbours, could have migrated inwards through eccentricity-based mechanisms triggered by secular interactions.</description>

      <title>High-resolution geostationary satellite observations of free tropospheric NO2 over North America: implications for lightning emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free tropospheric (FT) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) plays a critical role in atmospheric oxidant chemistry as a source of tropospheric ozone and of the hydroxyl radical (OH). It also contributes significantly to satellite-observed tropospheric NO2 columns, and must be subtracted when using these columns to quantify surface emissions of nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx = NO + NO2). But large uncertainties remain in the sources and chemistry of FT NO2 because observations are sparse. Here, we construct a new cloud-sliced FT NO2 (700-300 hPa) product from the TEMPO geostationary satellite instrument over North America. This product provides higher data density and quality than previous products from low Earth orbit (LEO) instruments, with the first observation of the FT NO2 diurnal cycle across seasons. Combined with coincident observations from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), the TEMPO data demonstrate the dominance of lightning as a source of FT NO2 in non-winter seasons. Comparison of TEMPO FT NO2 data with the GEOS-CF atmospheric chemistry model shows overall consistent magnitudes, seasonality, and diurnal variation, with a midday minimum in non-winter seasons from photochemical loss. However, there are major discrepancies that we attribute to GEOS-CF's use of a standard cloud-top-height (CTH)-based scheme for the lightning NOx source. We find this scheme greatly underestimates offshore lighting flash density and misrepresents the diurnal cycle of lightning over land. Our FT NO2 product provides a unique resource for improving the lightning NOx parameterization in atmospheric models and the ability to use NO2 observations from space to quantify surface NOx emissions.</description>

      <title>Detection of $J$-band photometric periodicity in the T8 dwarfs 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and EQ J1959-3338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: We aim to study the near-infrared variability of the T8 dwarfs 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and EQ J1959-3338 by analyzing their $J$-band photometric signal, which can provide new insights into the atmospheric dynamics of cold brown dwarfs. Methods: We used FLAMINGOS-2 on the Gemini South telescope to perform $J$-band differential photometry continuously over 4 h for each target. The resulting light curves have a cadence of 20 s and a photometric uncertainty of 2-4 mmag. Results: We detect periodic variability in both T8 dwarfs, with an amplitude of $16.6\pm0.9$ mmag and a period of $1.364\pm0.012$ h for EQ J1959-3338, which we attribute to rotational modulation. For 2MASS J09393548-2448279, we observe an amplitude of $4.6\pm0.4$ mmag and a period of $1.733\pm0.040$ h, though this periodicity could represent a fraction of a longer period. Conclusions: With the detection of variability in 2MASS J09393548-2448279 and EQ J1959-3338, the number of known variable T8 dwarfs has doubled, making them prime candidates for infrared space-based monitoring and radio observations to investigate atmospheric dynamics and the influence of the magnetic field in very cool atmospheres.</description>

Abstract: Between the 4th and 6th of September 2024, the Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics group at the University of Warwick held a meeting to celebrate 21 years of astronomy at Warwick and the scientific legacy of the late Prof. Tom Marsh, the group founder. More than a hundred people attended the meeting, with about half of the attendees being external delegates and coming from as far afield as the USA and South Africa. Tom Marsh moved to the University of Warwick from Southampton in 2003, after the Department of Physics decided to expand the scope of its research. From its humble beginnings with only two staff members, Tom himself and Boris G\"ansicke, one postdoc and a couple of PhD students, the group has now grown to more than 95 members, including 25 staff. Tom pioneered the development of Doppler tomography, led key discoveries in the field of double-degenerate binary systems and made extensive contributions to instrumentation, primarily to developing the high-speed imaging photometers ULTRACAM, ULTRASPEC and HiPERCAM. This article provides a summary of Tom's legacy and Warwick's history as presented in the 21 years of Astronomy at Warwick meeting.</description>

      <title>TOI-5005 b: A super-Neptune in the savanna near the ridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18129</link>

Abstract: The Neptunian desert and savanna have recently been found to be separated by a ridge, an overdensity of planets in the period range of $\simeq$3-5 days. These features are thought to be shaped by dynamical and atmospheric processes, but their roles are not yet well understood. Our aim was to confirm and characterize the super-Neptune TESS candidate TOI-5005.01, which orbits a moderately bright (V = 11.8) solar-type star (G2 V) with an orbital period of 6.3 days. We confirm TOI-5005 b to be a transiting super-Neptune with a radius of $R_{\rm p}$ = $6.25\pm 0.24$ $\rm R_{\rm \oplus}$ ($R_{\rm p}$ = $0.558\pm 0.021$ $\rm R_{\rm J}$) and a mass of $M_{\rm p}$ = $32.7\pm 5.9$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$ ($M_{\rm p}$ = $0.103\pm 0.018$ $\rm M_{\rm J}$), which corresponds to a mean density of $\rho_{\rm p}$ = $0.74 \pm 0.16$ $\rm g \, cm^{-3}$. Our internal structure modelling indicates that the overall metal mass fraction is well constrained to a value slightly lower than that of Neptune and Uranus ($Z_{\rm planet}$ = $0.76^{+0.04}_{-0.11}$). We also estimated the present-day atmospheric mass-loss rate of TOI-5005 b, but found contrasting predictions depending on the choice of photoevaporation model. At a population level, we find statistical evidence ($p$-value = $0.0092^{+0.0184}_{-0.0066}$) that planets in the savanna such as TOI-5005 b tend to show lower densities than planets in the ridge, with a dividing line around 1 $\rm g \, cm^{-3}$, which supports the hypothesis of different evolutionary pathways populating the two regimes. TOI-5005 b is located in a key region of the period-radius space to study the transition between the Neptunian ridge and the savanna. It orbits the brightest star of all such planets, which makes it a target of interest for atmospheric and orbital architecture observations that will bring a clearer picture of its overall evolution.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and a planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kepler and TESS observations led to the discovery of many close-in super Earths, including some with ultra-short orbital periods ($\lesssim 1$ day). During and shortly after their multi-Myr formation epoch, their GKM host stars generally have kilogauss magnetic fields which can exert torques on the orbits of nearby super-Earths. In this work, we examine one aspect of this interaction: the magnetic torque resulting from Alfv\'en-wing drag on non-corotating, non-magnetized planets engulfed by the host stars' stellar wind. We compute the magnitude of this torque for a range of stellar magnetic field strengths, and planetary orbital velocities. We also model the planets' orbital evolution, taking into account for stellar spin down and magnetic field decay, and derive the boundaries within which ultra-short-period super-Earths can survive.</description>
