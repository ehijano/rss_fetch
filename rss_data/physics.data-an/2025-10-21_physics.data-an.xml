      <title>On the use of the Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods for Gravitational Wave Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Posterior inference on the more than a dozen parameters governing a gravitational wave (GW) event is challenging. A typical MCMC analysis can take around $100$ CPU hours, and next generation GW observatories will detect many thousands of events. Here we present a thorough comparison of the accuracy and computational cost of the Fisher Matrix, Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods (DALI) and traditional MCMC methods. We find that using DALI, which extends the traditional Fisher Matrix (FM) method to higher orders, allows for a good approximation of the posterior with a $55$ times smaller computational cost, and that the cost-benefit of the doublet-DALI is better than that of the triplet-DALI. We also show that the singlet-DALI, a hybrid MCMC-Fisher method, is much more accurate than the traditional FM and 10 times faster than the doublet-DALI. A large effort has been invested in forecasting the science case of different detector configurations, and the ability of making fast yet accurate estimations of the posteriors is an important step forward. We also introduce version \texttt{1.0} of the public \texttt{GWDALI} code, which incorporates automatic differentiation, modern waveforms and an optimized parameter decomposition.</description>

      <title>Absolute abstraction: a renormalisation group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstraction is the process of extracting the essential features from raw data while ignoring irrelevant details. It is well known that abstraction emerges with depth in neural networks, where deep layers capture abstract characteristics of data by combining lower level features encoded in shallow layers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop truly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction crucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within a renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to encompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this transformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for a representation which is absolutely abstract. This theoretical picture is tested in numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks and auto-encoders trained on data of different breadth. These show that representations in neural networks approach the Hierarchical Feature Model as the data get broader and as depth increases, in agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Evolving interdisciplinary contributions to global societal challenges: A 50-year overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing global societal challenges necessitates insights and expertise that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. In recent decades, interdisciplinary collaboration has been recognised as a vital driver of innovation and effective problem-solving, with the potential to profoundly influence policy and practice worldwide. However, quantitative evidence remains limited regarding how cross-disciplinary efforts contribute to societal challenges, as well as the evolving roles and relevance of specific disciplines in addressing these issues. To fill this gap, this study examines the long-term evolution of interdisciplinary contributions to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), drawing on extensive bibliometric data from OpenAlex. By analysing publication and citation trends across 19 research fields from 1970 to 2022, we reveal how the relative presence of different disciplines in addressing particular SDGs has shifted over time. Our results also provide unique evidence of the increasing interconnection between fields since the 2000s, coinciding with the United Nations' initiative to tackle global societal challenges through interdisciplinary efforts. These insights will benefit policymakers and practitioners as they reflect on past progress and plan for future action, particularly with the SDG target deadline approaching in the next five years.</description>

      <title>Family-Vicsek universality of the binary intrinsic dimension of nonequilibrium data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic dimension (ID) is a powerful tool to detect and quantify correlations from data. Recently, it has been successfully applied to study statistical and many-body systems in equilibrium, yet its application to systems away from equilibrium remains largely unexplored. Here we study the ID of nonequilibrium growth dynamics data, and show that even after reducing these data to binary form, their binary intrinsic dimension (BID) retains essential physical information. Specifically, we find that, akin to the surface width, it exhibits Family-Vicsek dynamical scaling -- a fundamental feature to describe universality in surface roughness phenomena. These findings highlight the ability of the BID to correctly discern key properties and correlations in nonequilibrium data, and open an avenue for alternative characterizations of out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>
