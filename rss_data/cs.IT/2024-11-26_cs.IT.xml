      <title>Uplink Multiple Access with Heterogeneous Blocklength and Reliability Constraints: Discrete Signaling with Treating Interference as Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the uplink multiple access of heterogeneous users, e.g., ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) users. Each user has its own reliability requirement and blocklength constraint, and users transmitting longer blocks suffer from heterogeneous interference. On top of that, the decoding of URLLC messages cannot leverage successive interference cancellation (SIC) owing to the stringent latency requirements. This can significantly degrade the spectral efficiency of all URLLC users when the interference is strong. To overcome this issue, we propose a new multiple access scheme employing discrete signaling and treating interference as noise (TIN) decoding, i.e., without SIC. Specifically, to handle heterogeneous interference while maintaining the single-user encoding and decoding complexities, each user uses a single channel code and maps its coded bits onto sub-blocks of symbols, where the underlying constellations can be different. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that the proposed scheme employing quadrature amplitude modulations and TIN decoding can perform very close to the benchmark scheme based on Gaussian signaling with perfect SIC decoding. Interestingly, we show that the proposed scheme does not need to use all the transmit power budget, but also can sometimes even outperform the benchmark scheme.</description>

      <title>Single Antenna Tracking and Localization of RIS-enabled Vehicular Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to be employed in next generation wireless networks to enhance the communication and radio localization services. In this paper, we propose novel localization and tracking algorithms exploiting reflections through RISs at multiple receivers. We utilize a single antenna transmitter (Tx) and multiple single antenna receivers (Rxs) to estimate the position and the velocity of users (e.g. vehicles) equipped with RISs. Then, we design the RIS phase shifts to separate the signals from different users. The proposed algorithms exploit the geometry information of the signal at the RISs to localize and track the users. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the localization system. Compared to the time of arrival (ToA)-based localization approach, the proposed method reduces the localization error by a factor up to three. Also, the simulation results show the accuracy of the proposed tracking approach.</description>

      <title>RIS with Coupled Phase Shift and Amplitude: Capacity Maximization and Configuration Set Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a planar surface that can enhance the quality of communication by providing control over the communication environment. Reflection optimization is one of the pivotal challenges in RIS setups. While there has been lots of research regarding the reflection optimization of RIS, most works consider the independence of the phase shift and the amplitude of RIS reflection coefficients. In practice, the phase shift and the amplitude are coupled and according to a recent study, the relation between them can be described using a function. In our work, we consider a practical system model with coupled phase shift and amplitude. We develop an efficient method for achieving capacity maximization by finding the optimal reflection coefficients of the RIS elements. The complexity of our method is linear with the number of RIS elements and the number of discrete phase shifts. We also develop a method that optimally selects the configuration set of the system, where a configuration set means a discrete set of reflection coefficient choices that a RIS element can take.</description>

      <title>Editable-DeepSC: Reliable Cross-Modal Semantic Communications for Facial Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time computer vision (CV) plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, whose performance is highly dependent on communication networks. Nonetheless, the data-oriented characteristics of conventional communications often do not align with the special needs of real-time CV tasks. To alleviate this issue, the recently emerged semantic communications only transmit task-related semantic information and exhibit a promising landscape to address this problem. However, the communication challenges associated with Semantic Facial Editing, one of the most important real-time CV applications on social media, still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing Editable-DeepSC, a novel cross-modal semantic communication approach for facial editing. Firstly, we theoretically discuss different transmission schemes that separately handle communications and editings, and emphasize the necessity of Joint Editing-Channel Coding (JECC) via iterative attributes matching, which integrates editings into the communication chain to preserve more semantic mutual information. To compactly represent the high-dimensional data, we leverage inversion methods via pre-trained StyleGAN priors for semantic coding. To tackle the dynamic channel noise conditions, we propose SNR-aware channel coding via model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments indicate that Editable-DeepSC can achieve superior editings while significantly saving the transmission bandwidth, even under high-resolution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.</description>

      <title>Robust Hybrid Precoding for Millimeter Wave MU-MISO System Via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the low cost and power consumption, hybrid analog-digital architectures are considered as a promising energy-efficient solution for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The key idea is to connect one RF chain to multiple antennas through low-cost phase shifters. However, due to the non-convex objective function and constraints, we propose a gradient-guided meta-learning (GGML) based alternating optimization framework to solve this challenging problem. The GGML based hybrid precoding framework is \textit{free-of-training} and \textit{plug-and-play}. Specifically, GGML feeds the raw gradient information into a neural network, leveraging gradient descent to alternately optimize sub-problems from a local perspective, while a lightweight neural network embedded within the meta-learning framework is updated from a global perspective. We also extend the proposed framework to include precoding with imperfect channel state information. Simulation results demonstrate that GGML can significantly enhance spectral efficiency, and speed up the convergence by 8 times faster compared to traditional approaches. Moreover, GGML could even outperform fully digital weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) precoding with the same number of antennas.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate and analyze various entropy measures and their properties for selected probability distributions. The entropies considered include Shannon, R\'enyi, generalized R\'enyi, Tsallis, Sharma-Mittal, and modified Shannon entropy, along with the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These measures are examined for several distributions, including gamma, chi-squared, exponential, Laplace, and log-normal distributions. We investigate the dependence of the entropy on the parameters of the respective distribution. We also study the convergence of Shannon entropy for certain probability distributions. Furthermore, we identify the extreme values of Shannon entropy for Gaussian vectors.</description>

      <title>Run-Length-Limited ISI-Mitigation (RLIM) Coding for Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-symbol interference (ISI) is a significant challenge in diffusion-based communication channels, where residual molecules from previous transmissions interfere with the current signal interval, leading to detection errors. We introduce a new infinite family of coding schemes, which we name RLIM, that require each 1-bit to be followed by at least i consecutive 0-bits, where i is any chosen positive integer. This enhances ISI mitigation and improves error correction capabilities compared to existing ISI-mitigating channel codes. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the codebooks derived from the proposed RLIM scheme reduce bit error rate compared to prominent coding methods. Simulation results also reveal that an important constraint in RLIM codes is redundant, removal of which makes them equivalent to run-length-limited (RLL) codes. Notably, despite this equivalence, the proposed family of RLIM coding schemes retains a distinct power optimization constraint and employs a specialized error correction algorithm, preserving its unique character.</description>

      <title>Iterative Gradient Descent Decoding for Real Number LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new iterative gradient descent decoding method for real number parity codes. The proposed decoder, named Gradient Descent Symbol Update (GDSU), is used for a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) real-number codes that can be defined with parity check matrices which are similar to those of the binary LDPC from communication standards such as WiFi (IEEE 802.11), 5G. These codes have a simple and efficient two stage encoding that is especially appealing for the real number field. The Gradient optimization based decoding has been a relatively simple and fast decoding technique for codes over finite fields. We show that the GDSU decoder outperforms the gradient descent bit-flipping (GDBF) decoder for rates $1/2$, $2/3$, and has similar decoding performance for the $3/4$ rate of the IEEE 802.11 codes standard.</description>

      <title>Structured Tensor Decomposition Based Channel Estimation and Double Refinements for Active RIS Empowered Broadband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel parameter estimation is crucial for optimal designs of next-generation reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communications and sensing. Tensor-based mechanisms are particularly effective, capturing the multi-dimensional nature of wireless channels, especially in scenarios where RIS integrates with multiple-antenna devices. However, existing studies assume either a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario or a blocked condition for non-RIS channel. This paper solves a novel problem: tensor-based channel parameter recovery for active RIS-aided multiple-antenna wideband connections in a multipath environment with non-RIS paths. System settings are customized to construct the received signals as a fifth-order canonical polyadic (CP) tensor. Four of the five-factor matrices unfortunately contain redundant columns, and the remaining one is a Vandermonde matrix, which fails to satisfy the Kruskal condition for tensor decomposition uniqueness. To address this issue, spatial smoothing and Vandermonde structured CP decomposition (VSCPD) are applied, making the tensor factorization problem solvable and providing a relaxed general uniqueness condition. A sequential triple-stage channel estimation framework is proposed based on the factor estimates. The first stage enables multipath identification and algebraic coarse estimation, while the following two stages offer optional successive refinements at the cost of increased complexity. The closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to assess the estimation performance. Herein, the noise covariance matrix depends on multipath parameters in our active-RIS scenario. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms under various evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Shortest Path Lengths in Poisson Line Cox Processes: Approximations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact expressions for the shortest path length to a point of a Poisson line Cox process (PLCP) from the typical point of the PLCP and from the typical intersection of the underlying Poisson line process (PLP), restricted to a single turn. For the two turns case, we derive a bound on the shortest path length from the typical point and demonstrate conditions under which the bound is tight. We also highlight the line process and point process densities for which the shortest path from the typical intersection under the one turn restriction may be shorter than the shortest path from the typical point under the two turns restriction. Finally, we discuss two applications where our results can be employed for a statistical characterization of system performance: in a re-configurable intelligent surface (RIS) enabled vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system and in electric vehicle charging point deployment planning in urban streets.</description>

      <title>Polarization under the Channel Noise with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The channel polarization under the channel noise with memory is comprehensively studied. With the help of the genie-aided channel, we prove that the polarized channels also converge to extremal channels under the standard polar codes structure. More importantly, the ratio of the perfect channel can be larger than $I(W)$ which is the capacity of the original channel. However, the polarization rate is shown to be slower than the binary-input discrete memoryless channel (DMC) case. Specifically, the upper bound of the block error is $\mathcal{O}(L^{-c_0})$ where $L$ is the block length and $c_0$ is some positive constant. Furthermore, the upper and lower bound of the gap between the capacity and cutoff rate is investigated when the block length is finite, which is more useful for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Bivariate Linear Operator Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a generalization of the linear operator family of codes that captures more codes that achieve list decoding capacity. Linear operator (LO) codes were introduced by Bhandari, Harsha, Kumar, and Sudan [BHKS24] as a way to capture capacity-achieving codes. In their framework, a code is specified by a collection of linear operators that are applied to a message polynomial and then evaluated at a specified set of evaluation points. We generalize this idea in a way that can be applied to bivariate message polynomials, getting what we call bivariate linear operator (B-LO) codes.
  We show that bivariate linear operator codes capture more capacity-achieving codes, including permuted product codes introduced by Berman, Shany, and Tamo [BST24]. These codes work with bivariate message polynomials, which is why our generalization is necessary to capture them as a part of the linear operator framework.
  Similarly to the initial paper on linear operator codes, we present sufficient conditions for a bivariate linear operator code to be list decodable. Using this characterization, we are able to derive the theorem characterizing list-decodability of LO codes as a specific case of our theorem for B-LO codes. We also apply this theorem to show that permuted product codes are list decodable up to capacity, thereby unifying this result with those of known list-decodable LO codes, including Folded Reed-Solomon, Multiplicity, and Affine Folded Reed-Solomon codes.</description>

      <title>Physically Parameterized Differentiable MUSIC for DoA Estimation with Uncalibrated Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15144v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation is a common sensing problem in radar, sonar, audio, and wireless communication systems. It has gained renewed importance with the advent of the integrated sensing and communication paradigm. To fully exploit the potential of such sensing systems, it is crucial to take into account potential hardware impairments that can negatively impact the obtained performance. This study introduces a joint DoA estimation and hardware impairment learning scheme following a model-based approach. Specifically, a differentiable version of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is derived, allowing efficient learning of the considered impairments. The proposed approach supports both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies, showcasing its practical potential. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method successfully learns significant inaccuracies in both antenna locations and complex gains. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms the classical MUSIC algorithm in the DoA estimation task.</description>

      <title>Federated PCA and Estimation for Spiked Covariance Matrices: Optimal Rates and Efficient Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant recent attention in machine learning for its enhanced privacy and data security, making it indispensable in fields such as healthcare, finance, and personalized services. This paper investigates federated PCA and estimation for spiked covariance matrices under distributed differential privacy constraints. We establish minimax rates of convergence, with a key finding that the central server's optimal rate is the harmonic mean of the local clients' minimax rates. This guarantees consistent estimation at the central server as long as at least one local client provides consistent results. Notably, consistency is maintained even if some local estimators are inconsistent, provided there are enough clients. These findings highlight the robustness and scalability of FL for reliable statistical inference under privacy constraints. To establish minimax lower bounds, we derive a matrix version of van Trees' inequality, which is of independent interest. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm that preserves differential privacy while achieving near-optimal rates at the central server, up to a logarithmic factor. We address significant technical challenges in analyzing this algorithm, which involves a three-layer spectral decomposition. Numerical performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated using both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Improving Pre-Trained Self-Supervised Embeddings Through Effective Entropy Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of different architectures and loss functions have been applied to the problem of self-supervised learning (SSL), with the goal of developing embeddings that provide the best possible pre-training for as-yet-unknown, lightly supervised downstream tasks. One of these SSL criteria is to maximize the entropy of a set of embeddings in some compact space. But the goal of maximizing the embedding entropy often depends--whether explicitly or implicitly--upon high dimensional entropy estimates, which typically perform poorly in more than a few dimensions. In this paper, we motivate an effective entropy maximization criterion (E2MC), defined in terms of easy-to-estimate, low-dimensional constraints. We demonstrate that using it to continue training an already-trained SSL model for only a handful of epochs leads to a consistent and, in some cases, significant improvement in downstream performance. We perform careful ablation studies to show that the improved performance is due to the proposed add-on criterion. We also show that continued pre-training with alternative criteria does not lead to notable improvements, and in some cases, even degrades performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relay Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communication over a fully quantum relay channel is considered. We establish three bounds based on different coding strategies, i.e., partial decode-forward, measure-forward, and assist-forward. Using the partial-decode forward strategy, the relay decodes part of the information, while the other part is decoded without the relay's help. The result by Savov et al. (2012) for a classical-quantum relay channel is obtained as a special case. Based on our partial-decode forward bound, the capacity is determined for Hadamard relay channels. In the measure-forward coding scheme, the relay performs a sequence of measurements and then sends a compressed representation of the measurement outcome to the destination receiver. The measure-forward strategy can be viewed as a generalization of the classical compress-forward bound. At last, we consider quantum relay channels with orthogonal receiver components. The assist-forward bound is based on a new approach, whereby the transmitter sends the message to the relay and simultaneously generates entanglement assistance between the relay and the destination receiver. Subsequently, the relay can transmit the message to the destination receiver with rate-limited entanglement assistance.</description>

      <title>Max-Normalized Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform for Limited Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT) exploits one-dimensional Wasserstein transport and the Radon transform to represent prominent features in images. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. The aim of this paper is to make the R-CDT and the related sliced Wasserstein distance invariant under affine transformations. For this, we propose a two-step normalization of the R-CDT and prove that our novel transform allows linear separation of affinely transformed image classes. The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments showing a significant increase of the classification accuracy compared to the original R-CDT.</description>

      <title>Information measures and geometry of the hyperbolic exponential families of Poincar\'e and hyperboloid distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various information-theoretic measures and the information geometry of the Poincar\'e distributions and the related hyperboloid distributions, and prove that their statistical mixture models are universal density estimators of smooth densities in hyperbolic spaces. The Poincar\'e and the hyperboloid distributions are two types of hyperbolic probability distributions defined using different models of hyperbolic geometry. Namely, the Poincar\'e distributions form a triparametric bivariate exponential family whose sample space is the hyperbolic Poincar\'e upper-half plane and natural parameter space is the open 3D convex cone of two-by-two positive-definite matrices. The family of hyperboloid distributions form another exponential family which has sample space the forward sheet of the two-sheeted unit hyperboloid modeling hyperbolic geometry. In the first part, we prove that all $f$-divergences between Poincar\'e distributions can be expressed using three canonical terms using Eaton's framework of maximal group invariance. We also show that the $f$-divergences between any two Poincar\'e distributions are asymmetric except when those distributions belong to a same leaf of a particular foliation of the parameter space. We report closed-form formula for the Fisher information matrix, the Shannon's differential entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. and Bhattacharyya distances between such distributions using the framework of exponential families. In the second part, we state the corresponding results for the exponential family of hyperboloid distributions by highlighting a parameter correspondence between the Poincar\'e and the hyperboloid distributions. Finally, we describe a random generator to draw variates and present two Monte Carlo methods to stochastically estimate numerically $f$-divergences between hyperbolic distributions.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Covert Communication with a Reflective Panel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09049v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of \emph{perfect} covert communication in wireless networks. Specifically, harnessing an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS), we turn our attention to schemes that allow the transmitter to completely hide the communication, with \emph{zero energy} at the unwanted listener (Willie) and hence zero probability of detection. Applications of such schemes go beyond simple covertness, as we prevent detectability or decoding even when the codebook, timings, and channel characteristics are known to Willie. We define perfect covertness, give a necessary and sufficient condition for it in IRS-assisted communication, and define the optimization problem. For two IRS elements, we analyze the probability of finding a solution and derive its closed form. We then investigate the problem of more than two IRS elements by analyzing the probability of such a zero-detection solution. We prove that this probability converges to $1$ as the number of elements tends to infinity. We provide an iterative algorithm to find a perfectly covert solution and prove its convergence. The results are also supported by simulations, showing that a small amount of IRS elements allows for a positive rate at the legitimate user yet with zero probability of detection at an unwanted listener.</description>

      <title>Efficient Wireless Federated Learning via Low-Rank Gradient Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel gradient compression method for federated learning (FL) in wireless systems. The proposed method centers on a low-rank matrix factorization strategy for local gradient compression that is based on one iteration of a distributed Jacobi successive convex approximation (SCA) at each FL round. The low-rank approximation obtained at one round is used as a "warm start" initialization for Jacobi SCA in the next FL round. A new protocol termed over-the-air low-rank compression (Ota-LC) incorporating this gradient compression method with over-the-air computation and error feedback is shown to have lower computation cost and lower communication overhead, while guaranteeing the same inference performance, as compared with existing benchmarks. As an example, when targeting a test accuracy of 70% on the Cifar-10 dataset, Ota-LC reduces total communication costs by at least 33% compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Joint Processing and Transmission Energy Optimization for ISAC in Cell-Free Massive MIMO with URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the concept of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) within a downlink cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system featuring multi-static sensing and users requiring ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). Our focus involves the formulation of two non-convex algorithms that jointly solve power and blocklength allocation for end-to-end (E2E) minimization. The objectives are to jointly minimize sensing/communication processing and transmission energy consumption, while simultaneously meeting the requirements for sensing and URLLC. To address the inherent non-convexity of these optimization problems, we utilize techniques such as the Feasible Point Pursuit - Successive Convex Approximation (FPP-SCA), Concave-Convex Programming (CCP), and fractional programming. We conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of these algorithms in ISAC scenarios and against a URLLC-only scenario where sensing is not integrated. Our numerical results highlight the superior performance of the E2E energy minimization algorithm, especially in scenarios without sensing capability. Additionally, our study underscores the increasing prominence of energy consumption associated with sensing processing tasks as the number of sensing receive access points rises. Furthermore, the results emphasize that a higher sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio threshold is associated with an escalation in E2E energy consumption, thereby narrowing the performance gap between the two proposed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present four constructions of {general} self-orthogonal matrix-product codes associated with Toeplitz matrices. The first one relies on the {dual} of a known {general} dual-containing matrix-product code; the second one is founded on {a specific family of} matrices, where we provide an efficient algorithm for generating them {on the basis of Toeplitz matrices} and {it has an interesting application in producing new non-singular by columns quasi-unitary matrices}; and the last two ones are based on the utilization of certain special Toeplitz matrices. Concrete examples and detailed comparisons are provided. As a byproduct, we also find an application of Toeplitz matrices, which is closely related to the constructions of quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity PSCL Decoding of Polar Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding enables polar codes and their generalizations to deliver satisfactory performance in finite-length scenarios but it comes with high latency and complexity. To reduce latency, a partitioned SCL (PSCL) decoding algorithm, implemented over a PSCL decoding tree, can be utilized. In this work, we aim to lower down the complexity of the PSCL decoding, resulting in an efficient decoding algorithm with low latency and complexity for polar-like codes. To achieve this, we define two metrics at each level of the PSCL decoding tree. One is for evaluating the reliability of a path and the other is for estimating the probability of the correct path being included in a list of paths. Then, we propose a double-threshold strategy in the PSCL decoding process where unreliable valid paths are pruned based on the first metric, and then a list of surviving paths is selected based on the second metric. Simulation results demonstrate that when polar/CRC-polar/PAC codes are decoded using the proposed low-complexity PSCL decoder, both the sorting complexity and the computational complexity are reduced and significantly decrease as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Neyman-Pearson Detection to Combat Strategic Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05276v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security in networked systems depends greatly on recognizing and identifying adversarial behaviors. Traditional detection methods focus on specific categories of attacks and have become inadequate for increasingly stealthy and deceptive attacks that are designed to bypass detection strategically. This work aims to develop a holistic theory to countermeasure such evasive attacks. We focus on extending a fundamental class of statistical-based detection methods based on Neyman-Pearson's (NP) hypothesis testing formulation. We propose game-theoretic frameworks to capture the conflicting relationship between a strategic evasive attacker and an evasion-aware NP detector. By analyzing both the equilibrium behaviors of the attacker and the NP detector, we characterize their performance using Equilibrium Receiver-Operational-Characteristic (EROC) curves. We show that the evasion-aware NP detectors outperform the passive ones in the way that the former can act strategically against the attacker's behavior and adaptively modify their decision rules based on the received messages. In addition, we extend our framework to a sequential setting where the user sends out identically distributed messages. We corroborate the analytical results with a case study of anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Management for Fast Service (Rates) in Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing operates between the cloud and end users and strives to provide low-latency computing services for simultaneous users. Redundant use of multiple edge nodes can reduce latency, as edge systems often operate in uncertain environments. However, since edge systems have limited computing and storage resources, directing more resources to some computing jobs will either block the execution of others or pass their execution to the cloud, thus increasing latency. This paper uses the average system computing time and blocking probability to evaluate edge system performance and analyzes the optimal resource allocation accordingly. We also propose blocking probability and average system time optimization algorithms. Simulation results show that both algorithms significantly outperform the benchmark for different service time distributions and show how the optimal replication factor changes with varying parameters of the system.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Deception with Non-Orthogonal Multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) is a promising technology to secure wireless communications by exploiting the physical properties of the wireless channel. However, the passive nature of PLS creates a significant imbalance between the effort required by eavesdroppers and legitimate users to secure data. To address this imbalance, in this article, we propose a novel framework of physical layer deception (PLD), which combines PLS with deception technologies to actively counteract wiretapping attempts. Combining a two-stage encoder with randomized ciphering and non-orthogonal multiplexing, the PLD approach enables the wireless communication system to proactively counter eavesdroppers with deceptive messages. Relying solely on the superiority of the legitimate channel over the eavesdropping channel, the PLD framework can effectively protect the confidentiality of the transmitted messages, even against eavesdroppers who possess knowledge equivalent to that of the legitimate receiver. We prove the validity of the PLD framework with in-depth analyses and demonstrate its superiority over conventional PLS approaches with comprehensive numerical benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>

      <title>Learning Personalized Treatment Decisions in Precision Medicine: Disentangling Treatment Assignment Bias in Counterfactual Outcome Prediction and Biomarker Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision medicine has the potential to tailor treatment decisions to individual patients using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), but it faces significant challenges due to complex biases in clinical observational data and the high-dimensional nature of biological data. This study models various types of treatment assignment biases using mutual information and investigates their impact on ML models for counterfactual prediction and biomarker identification. Unlike traditional counterfactual benchmarks that rely on fixed treatment policies, our work focuses on modeling different characteristics of the underlying observational treatment policy in distinct clinical settings. We validate our approach through experiments on toy datasets, semi-synthetic tumor cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data, and real-world biological outcomes from drug and CRISPR screens. By incorporating empirical biological mechanisms, we create a more realistic benchmark that reflects the complexities of real-world data. Our analysis reveals that different biases lead to varying model performances, with some biases, especially those unrelated to outcome mechanisms, having minimal effect on prediction accuracy. This highlights the crucial need to account for specific biases in clinical observational data in counterfactual ML model development, ultimately enhancing the personalization of treatment decisions in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Physically-Consistent Modeling of Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable electromagnetic structures (REMSs), such as reconfigurable reflectarrays (RRAs) or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), hold significant potential to improve wireless communication and sensing systems. Even though several REMS modeling approaches have been proposed in recent years, the literature lacks models that are both computationally efficient and physically consistent. As a result, algorithms that control the reconfigurable elements of REMSs (e.g., the phase shifts of an RIS) are often built on simplistic models that are inaccurate. To enable physically accurate REMS-parameter tuning, we present a new framework for efficient and physically consistent modeling of general REMSs. Our modeling method combines a circuit-theoretic approach with a new formalism that describes a REMS's interaction with the electromagnetic (EM) waves in its far-field region. Our modeling method enables efficient computation of the entire far-field radiation pattern for arbitrary configurations of the REMS reconfigurable elements once a single full-wave EM simulation of the non-reconfigurable parts of the REMS has been performed. The predictions made by the proposed framework align with the physical laws of classical electrodynamics and model effects caused by inter-antenna coupling, non-reciprocal materials, polarization, ohmic losses, matching losses, influence of metallic housings, noise from low-noise amplifiers, and noise arising in or received by antennas. In order to validate the efficiency and accuracy of our modeling approach, we (i) compare our modeling method to EM simulations and (ii) conduct a case study involving a planar RRA that enables simultaneous multiuser beam- and null-forming using a new, computationally efficient, and physically accurate parameter tuning algorithm.</description>
