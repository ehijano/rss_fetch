      <title>Nonsuppressible viremia during HIV-1 therapy meets molecular virology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIV-1 replication can be suppressed with antiretroviral therapy (ART), but individuals who stop taking ART soon become viremic again. Some people experience extended times of detectable viremia despite optimal adherence to ART. In the issue of the JCI, White, Wu, and coauthors elucidate a source of nonsuppressible viremia (NSV) in treatment-adherent patients clonally expanded T cells harboring HIV-1 proviruses with small deletions or mutations in the 5'-leader, the UTR that includes the major splice donor site of viral RNA. These mutations altered viral RNA-splicing efficiency and RNA dimerization and packaging, yet still allowed production of detectable levels of noninfectious virus particles. These particles lacked the HIV-1 Env surface protein required for cell entry and failed to form the mature capsid cone required for infectivity. These studies improve our understanding of NSV and the regulation of viral functions in the 5'-leader with implications for rationalized care in individuals with NSV.</description>

      <title>Hydrated Cable Bacteria Exhibit Protonic Conductivity Over Long Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the direct measurement of proton transport along filamentous Desulfobulbaceae, or cable bacteria. Cable bacteria are filamentous multicellular microorganisms that have garnered much interest due to their ability to serve as electrical conduits, transferring electrons over several millimeters. Our results indicate that cable bacteria can also function as protonic conduits because they contain proton wires that transport protons at distances greater than 100 um. We find that protonic conductivity ({\sigma}P) along cable bacteria varies between samples and is measured as high as 114 +/- 28 uS cm^-1 at 25-degrees C and 70-percent relative humidity (RH). For cable bacteria, the protonic conductance (GP) and {\sigma}P are dependent upon the RH, increasing by as much as 26-fold between 60-percent and 80-percent RH. This observation implies that proton transport occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism along water associated with cable bacteria, forming proton wires. In order to determine {\sigma}P and GP along cable bacteria, we implemented a protocol using a modified transfer-printing technique to deposit either palladium interdigitated protodes (IDP), palladium transfer length method (TLM) protodes, or gold interdigitated electrodes(IDE) on top of cable bacteria. Due to the relatively mild nature of the transfer-printing technique, this method should be applicable to a broad array of biological samples and curved materials. The observation of protonic conductivity in cable bacteria presents possibilities for investigating the importance of long-distance proton transport in microbial ecosystems and to potentially build biotic or biomimetic scaffolds to interface with materials via proton-mediated gateways or channels.</description>
