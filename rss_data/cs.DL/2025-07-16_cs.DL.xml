      <title>Artificial Intelligence and Journalism: A Systematic Bibliometric and Thematic Analysis of Global Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping journalistic practices across the globe, offering new opportunities while raising ethical, professional, and societal concerns. This study presents a comprehensive systematic review of published articles on AI in journalism from 2010 to 2025. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines, a total of 72 peer-reviewed articles were selected from Scopus and Web of Science databases. The analysis combines bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis to identify dominant trends, technologies, geographical distributions, and ethical debates. Additionally, sentiment analysis was performed on article abstracts using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) algorithm to capture evaluative tones across the literature. The findings show a sharp increase in research activity after 2020, with prominent focus areas including automation, misinformation, and ethical governance. While most studies reflect cautious optimism, concerns over bias, transparency, and accountability remain persistent. The review also highlights regional disparities in scholarly contributions, with limited representation from the Global South. By integrating quantitative and qualitative insights, this study offers a multi-dimensional understanding of how AI is transforming journalism and proposes future research directions for inclusive and responsible innovation.</description>

      <title>Automated Novelty Evaluation of Academic Paper: A Collaborative Approach Integrating Human and Large Language Model Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11330v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain. Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to address the limitations of novelty assessment. One of the most common types of novelty in academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs, e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper, which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.</description>

      <title>Estimating transformative agreement impact on hybrid open access: A comparative large-scale study using Scopus, Web of Science and open metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study compares open metadata from hoaddata, an openly available dataset based on Crossref, OpenAlex and the cOAlition S Journal Checker Tool, with proprietary bibliometric databases Scopus and Web of Science to estimate the impact of transformative agreements on hybrid open access publishing. Analysing over 13,000 hybrid journals between 2019-2023, the research found substantial growth in open access due to these agreements, although most articles remain paywalled. The results were consistent across all three data sources, showing strong correlations in country-level metrics despite differences in journal coverage and metadata availability. By 2023, transformative agreements enabled the majority of open access in hybrid journals, with particularly high adoption in European countries. The analysis revealed strong alignment between first and corresponding authorship when measuring agreement uptake by publisher and country. This comparative approach supports the use of open metadata for large-scale hybrid open access studies, while using multiple data sources together provides a more robust understanding of hybrid open access adoption than any single database can offer, overcoming individual limitations in coverage and metadata quality.</description>
