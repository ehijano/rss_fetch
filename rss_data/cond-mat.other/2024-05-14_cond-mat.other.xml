      <title>Wide energy range cross section of elastic electron scattering in matter: dependence of dynamical screening of target atoms on electron velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of electron-atoms (elastic) scattering of electrons in matter, applicable in a wide electron energy range from ~eV up to relativistic ones. The approach based on the dynamic-structure factor considers dynamical screening of atomic nuclei in a target by valence (collective) and core-shell electrons, dependent on the incident electron velocity. The model allows simulating electron transport in matter with a unified approach to the elastic scattering. The cross section recovers the limiting cases of the electron-phonon scattering in the low energy limit, and a screened-ion scattering with the decreasing screening reducing to the scattering on a bare nucleus in the high energy limit.</description>

      <title>Electric-field gradients at the nuclei from all-electron, four-component relativistic density-functional theory using Gaussian-type orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-electron, four-component relativistic implementation of electric field gradients (EFGs) at the nuclei using Gaussian-type orbitals and periodic boundary conditions. This allows us to include relativistic effects variationally, which is important for compounds containing heavy elements and for a property dependent the electronic structure close to the nuclei. The all-electron approach ensures an accurate treatment of both core and valence orbitals, as both are important in the evaluation of EFGs. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of a recent implementation of density fitting in combination with quaternion algebra and restricted kinetic balance. We use the relativistic approach to calculate the EFGs in different arsenic, antimony and bismuth halides and oxyhalides, and explore the importance of relativistic effects on EFGs in solids and compare these with results obtained for molecular species. Our calculations contribute to establishing a reliable estimate for the nuclear quadrupole moment of 209Bi, for which our best estimate is -428(17) mb, in excellent agreement both with molecular data and a recent reevaluation of the nuclear quadrupole moment obtained from atomic data and ab initio calculations. Our results suggest that there is a need to revisit the experimental data for the EFGs of several bismuth oxyhalides.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Transfer in Interacting, Multiple-Excitation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer (QST) describes the coherent passage of quantum information from one node in a network to another. Experiments on QST span a diverse set of platforms and currently report transport across up to tens of nodes in times of several hundred nanoseconds with fidelities that can approach 90% or more. Theoretical studies examine both the lossless time evolution associated with a given (Hermitian) lattice Hamiltonian and methods based on the master equation that allows for losses. In this paper, we describe Monte Carlo techniques which enable the discovery of a Hamiltonian that gives high-fidelity QST. We benchmark our approach in geometries appropriate to coupled optical cavity-emitter arrays and discuss connections to condensed matter Hamiltonians of localized orbitals coupled to conduction bands. The resulting Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard and periodic Anderson models can, in principle, be engineered in appropriate hardware to give efficient QST.</description>

      <title>XY model on a self-avoiding walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice model of a magnetic polymer where the XY spin variables are located on a self-avoiding walk (SAW) on a regular lattice in two and three dimensions. We consider the regime where both spins and conformations are dynamic, thus the XY model is defined on a dynamic lattice and conformations generate an annealed disorder. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the globule-coil and ferromagnetic phase transitions, and pay special attention to the vicinity of the theta-point. Our numerical results suggest that the transitions are continuous in two dimensions and first-order in three dimensions, which is similar to related models with Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Fitting to magnetic forces improves the reliability of magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for fitting machine-learning interatomic potentials with magnetic degrees of freedom, namely, magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials (mMTP). The main feature of the methodology consists in fitting mMTP to magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) derived from spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. We test our method on the bcc Fe-Al system with different composition. Specifically, we calculate formation energies, equilibrium lattice parameter, and total cell magnetization. Our findings demonstrate a precise match between values calculated with mMTP and those obtained by DFT at zero temperature. Additionally, using molecular dynamics, we estimate the finite temperature lattice parameter and capture the cell expansion as was previously revealed in experiment. We demonstrate that mMTPs fitted to magnetic forces, increase the relaxation reliability, which is the percent of successfully relaxed structures (i.e. with almost zero forces, stresses, and magnetic moments after the optimization of geometry). Eventually, we show that the proposed methodology can provide an accurate and reliable mMTP with reduced number of computationally complex spin-polarized density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Screening the organic materials database for superconducting metal-organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing financial and environmental cost of many inorganic materials has motivated study into organic and "green" alternatives. However, most organic compounds contain a large number of atoms in the primitive unit cell, posing a significant barrier to high-throughput screening for functional properties. In this work, we attempt to overcome this challenge and identify superconducting candidates among the metal-organic-frameworks in the organic materials database using a recently proposed proxy for the electron-phonon coupling. We then isolate the most promising candidate for in-depth analysis, C$_{9}$H$_{8}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{11}$, providing evidence for superconductivity below $100$mK.</description>

      <title>Recent progress on quantum simulations of non-standard Bose-Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the systems comprising of bosonic atoms confined to optical lattices at ultra-cold temperatures have demonstrated tremendous potential to unveil novel quantum mechanical effects appearing in lattice boson models with various kinds of interactions. In this progress report, we aim to provide an exposition to recent advancements in quantum simulations of such systems, modeled by different "non-standard" Bose-Hubbard models, focusing primarily on long-range systems with dipole-dipole or cavity-mediated interactions. Through a carefully curated selection of topics, which includes the emergence of quantum criticality beyond Landau paradigm, bond-order wave insulators, the role of interaction-induced tunneling, the influence of transverse confinement on observed phases, or the effect of cavity-mediated all-to-all interactions, we report both theoretical and experimental developments from the last few years. Additionally, we discuss the real-time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, where sufficiently strong interactions render the dynamics non-ergodic. And finally to cap our discussions off, we survey recent experimental achievements in this rapidly evolving field, underscoring its interdisciplinary significance and potential for groundbreaking discoveries.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of thin parahydrogen films on graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-temperature properties of one and two layers of parahydrogen adsorbed on graphite are investigated theoretically through Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We adopt a microscopic model that explicitly includes the corrugation of the substrate. We study the phase diagram of a monolayer up to second layer promotion, and the possible occurrence of superfluidity in the second layer. We obtain results down to a temperature as low as 8 mK. We find second-layer promotion to occur at a considerably greater coverage than obtained in previous calculations and estimated experimentally; moreover, we find no evidence of a possible finite superfluid response in the second layer, disproving recent theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Zero mode-soliton duality and pKdV kinks in Boussinesq system for non-linear shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Boussinesq system for a non-linear shallow water is considered. The nonlinear and topological effects are examined through an associated matrix spectral problem. It is shown an equivalence relationship between the bound states and topological soliton charge densities which resembles a formula of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer-type index theorem. The zero mode components describe a topologically protected Kelvin wave of KdV-type and a novel Boussinesq-type field. We show that either the $1+1$ dimensional pKdV kink or the Kelvin mode can be mapped to the bulk velocity potential in $2+1$ dimensions.</description>
