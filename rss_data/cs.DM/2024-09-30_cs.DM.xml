      <title>Scale Free Projections Arise from Bipartite Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree distribution of a real world network -- the number of links per node -- often follows a power law, with some hubs having many more links than traditional graph generation methods predict. For years, preferential attachment and growth have been the proposed mechanisms that lead to these scale free networks. However, the two sides of bipartite graphs like collaboration networks are usually not scale free, and are therefore not well-explained by these processes. Here we develop a bipartite extension to the Randomly Stopped Linking Model and show that mixtures of geometric distributions lead to power laws according to a Central Limit Theorem for distributions with high variance. The two halves of the actor-movie network are not scale free and can be represented by just 5 geometric distributions, but they combine to form a scale free actor-actor unipartite projection without preferential attachment or growth. This result supports our claim that scale free networks are the natural result of many Bernoulli trials with high variance of which preferential attachment and growth are only one example.</description>

      <title>An $11/6$-Approximation Algorithm for Vertex Cover on String Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a 1.8334-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover on string graphs given with a representation, which takes polynomial time in the size of the representation; the exact approximation factor is $11/6$. Recently, the barrier of 2 was broken by Lokshtanov et al. [SoGC '24] with a 1.9999-approximation algorithm. Thus we increase by three orders of magnitude the distance of the approximation ratio to the trivial bound of 2. Our algorithm is very simple. The intricacies reside in its analysis, where we mainly establish that string graphs without odd cycles of length at most 11 are 8-colorable. Previously, Chudnovsky, Scott, and Seymour [JCTB '21] showed that string graphs without odd cycles of length at most 7 are 80-colorable, and string graphs without odd cycles of length at most 5 have bounded chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Extending the definition of set tolerances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems can be sensitive to changes in the cost of one or more elements of the ground set E. Single and set tolerances measure the supremum / infimum possible change such that the current solution remains optimal for cost changes in one or more elements. The current definition does not apply to all elements of E or to all subsets of E. In this work, we broaden the definition to all elements for single tolerances and to all subsets of elements for set tolerances, while proving that key theoretical and computational properties still apply.</description>

      <title>On shortest products for nonnegative matrix mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite set of matrices with integer entries, the matrix mortality problem asks if there exists a product of these matrices equal to the zero matrix. We consider a special case of this problem where all entries of the matrices are nonnegative. This case is equivalent to the NFA mortality problem, which, given an NFA, asks for a word $w$ such that the image of every state under $w$ is the empty set. The size of the alphabet of the NFA is then equal to the number of matrices in the set. We study the length of shortest such words depending on the size of the alphabet. We show that for an NFA with $n$ states this length can be at least $2^n - 1$ for an alphabet of size $n$, $2^{(n - 4)/2}$ for an alphabet of size $3$ and $2^{(n - 2)/3}$ for an alphabet of size $2$. We also discuss further open problems related to mortality of NFAs and DFAs.</description>
