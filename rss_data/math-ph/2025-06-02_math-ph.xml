      <title>Elliptic Calogero-Sutherland model and conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a project with Gordon Semenoff on 1+1 dimensional QCD many years ago (when he was my postdoc advisor), we stumbled over a method to solve Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models using gauge theories. Since then, these models have reappeared in different forms in many of my research projects. In this contribution, I describe a recent such project where a second quantization of the elliptic Calogero-Sutherland model led us to a new soliton equation and a non-relativistic variant of the Coleman correspondence. (Work with Bjorn Berntson and Jonatan Lenells.)</description>

      <title>The quantitative semi-classical limit of a large Fermi system at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider a large system of fermions in a combined mean-field and semiclassical limit, in three dimensions. We investigate the convergence of the Wigner function of the ground state, towards the classical Thomas-Fermi theory. The main novelty of the present article is quantifying the convergence rate with respect to the semi-classical parameter. One of the main ingredients is a recent result on the validity of semi-classical commutator estimates satisfied by the Hartree theory. Singular potentials, up to the Coulomb interaction, are included.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Dobrushin-Shlosman conditions $C_{V}$ for the uniqueness of the Gibbs state provide an exact estimate for the critical temperature of the $d$-dimensional Ising model. Our method also shows that the $d$-dimensional Ising model with a magnetic field is Completely Analytic above its critical temperature.</description>

      <title>A microscopic Normal Matrix Model for $(A)dS_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the duality between the gravitating $c=1$ (compact) Sine-Gordon model and a normal matrix model. From a two-dimensional quantum gravity perspective and due to the periodic nature of the potential, this model admits both anti-de Sitter and de-Sitter saddles, similarly to simpler models of Sine-Dilaton gravity, as well as more complicated interpolating "wineglass wormhole" geometries. From a string theory perspective the Euclidean de-Sitter (genus zero) saddles are related to the presence of a classical entropic contribution associated to the target space geometry. The gravitating Sine-Gordon model corresponds to a well defined CFT by construction and the eigenvalues of the dual normal matrix model are supported in a compact region of the complex plane. The duality with the normal matrix model is operationally defined even for a finite, but sufficiently large matrix size $N$, depending on the precise observable to be determined. We define and study a "microscopic" version of the large-N limit that allows us to recover non-perturbative results for all physical observables.</description>

      <title>Density of states correlations in L\'evy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetry approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied global density-of-states correlation function $R(\omega)$ for L\'evy-Rosenzveig-Porter random matrix ensemble~\cite{BirTar_Levy-RP} in the non-ergodic extended phase. Using extension of Efetov's supersymmetry approach ~\cite{MirFyod_non_Gauss} we calculated $R(\omega)$ exactly in all relevant ranges of $\omega$. At relatively low $\omega \leq \Gamma$\, (with $\Gamma \gg \Delta$ being effective mini-band width) we found GUE-type oscillations with period of level spacing $\Delta$, decaying exponentially at the Thouless energy scale $E_{Th} = \sqrt{\Delta \Gamma/2\pi}$. At high energies $\omega \gg E_{Th}$ our results coincide with those obtained in Ref.~\cite{lunkin2024localdensitystatescorrelations} via cavity equation approach. Inverse of the effective mini-band width $1/\Gamma$ is shown to be given by the average of the local decay times over L\'evy distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a smooth velocity field $u$ on $\mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{T}^3$ that exhibits kinematic dynamo action, causing exponential growth in solutions to the magnetohydrodynamic induction equation, with a rate that is uniform in diffusivity, for suitable sequences of diffusivity $\kappa_j \to 0.$ We call this a subsequentially fast dynamo, giving dynamo behavior intermediate between a truly slow dynamo and a truly fast dynamo.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the limiting critical Potts measures on locally regular-tree-like expander graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any integers $d,q\ge 3$, we consider the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model with an external field on a sequence of expander graphs that converges to the $d$-regular tree $\mathtt{T}_d$ in the Benjamini-Schramm sense. We show that along the critical line, any subsequential local weak limit of the Potts measures is a mixture of the free and wired Potts Gibbs measures on $\mathtt{T}_d$. Furthermore, we show the possibility of an arbitrary extent of strong phase coexistence: for any $\alpha\in [0,1]$, there exists a sequence of locally $\mathtt{T}_d$-like expander graphs $\{G_n\}$, such that the Potts measures on $\{G_n\}$ locally weakly converges to the $(\alpha,1-\alpha)$-mixture of the free and wired Potts Gibbs measures. Our result extends results of \cite{HJP23} which restrict to the zero-field case and also require $q$ to be sufficiently large relative to $d$, and results of \cite{BDS23} which restrict to the even $d$ case. We also confirm the phase coexistence prediction of \cite{BDS23}, asserting that the Potts local weak limit is a genuine mixture of the free and wired states in a generic setting. We further characterize the subsequential local weak limits of random cluster measures on such graph sequences, for any cluster parameter $q&gt;2$ (not necessarily integer).</description>

      <title>A system of 2 nonlinearly coupled ODEs which is explicitly solvable and possibly isochronous provided its coefficients are suitably restricted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss some remarkable properties of the autonomous system of 2 first-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), which equates the derivatives $\dot{x}_n(t)$ ($n = 1, 2$) of the 2 dependent variables $x_n(t)$ to the ratios of polynomials (with constant coefficients) in the 2 variables $x_n (t)$: each of the 2 (a priori different) polynomials $P_3^{(n)}(x_1, x_2)$ in the 2 numerators is of degree 3; the 2 denominators are instead given by the same polynomial $P_1(x_1, x_2)$ of degree 1. Hence this system features 23 a priori arbitrary input numbers, namely the 23 coefficients defining these 3 polynomials. Our main finding is to show that if these 23 coefficients are given by 23 (explicitly provided) formulas in terms of 15 a priori arbitrary parameters, then the initial values problem (with arbitrary initial data $x_n (0)$) for this dynamical system can be explicitly solved. We also show that it is possible (with the help of Mathematica) to identify 12 explicit constraints on these 23 coefficients, which are sufficient to guarantee that this system belongs to the class of systems we are focusing on. Several such explicitly solvable systems of ODEs are treated (including the subcase with $P_1(x_1, x_2) = 1$, implying that the right-hand sides of the ODEs are just cubic polynomials: no denominators!). Examples of the solutions of several of these systems are reported and displayed, including cases in which the solutions are isochronous.</description>

Abstract: We pose and solve an inverse problem for the classical field equations that arise in the Standard Model of particle physics. Our main result describes natural conditions on the representations, so that it is possible to recover all the fields from measurements in a small set within a causal domain in Minkowski space. These conditions are satisfied for the representations arising in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>A universal constraint for relaxation rates for quantum Markov generators: complete positivity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation rates are key characteristics of quantum processes, as they determine how quickly a quantum system thermalizes, equilibrates, decoheres, and dissipates. While they play a crucial role in theoretical analyses, relaxation rates are also often directly accessible through experimental measurements. Recently, it was shown that for quantum processes governed by Markovian semigroups, the relaxation rates satisfy a universal constraint: the maximal rate is upper-bounded by the sum of all rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. This bound, initially conjectured a few years ago, was only recently proven using classical Lyapunov theory. In this work, we present a new, purely algebraic proof of this constraint. Remarkably, our approach is not only more direct but also allows for a natural generalization beyond completely positive semigroups. We show that complete positivity can be relaxed to 2-positivity without affecting the validity of the constraint. This reveals that the bound is more subtle than previously understood: 2-positivity is necessary, but even when further relaxed to Schwarz maps, a slightly weaker -- yet still non-trivial -- universal constraint still holds. Finally, we explore the connection between these bounds and the number of steady states in quantum processes, uncovering a deeper structure underlying their behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weight systems are functions on chord diagrams satisfying Vassiliev's $4$-term relations. They originate in the theory of finite type knot invariants. Recent developments in understanding weight systems arising from Lie algebras are based on extending these weight systems from chord diagrams (which can be interpreted as involutions without fixed points, considered modulo cyclic shifts) to arbitrary permutations (also modulo cyclic shifts). We suggest relations for functions on permutations, which generalize Vassiliev's relations. We show that the $gl$- and $so$- weight systems satisfy these relations. We also analyze certain properties of these weight systems and study realted Hopf algebras of permutations.</description>

      <title>Emergent boundary supersymmetry in a one dimensional superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between bulk properties and boundary conditions in one-dimensional quantum systems, gives rise to many intriguing phenomena. These include the emergence of zero energy modes which are of significant interest to a variety of fields. In this work we investigate the presence of such zero modes in cases where the boundary conditions are dynamical and arise due to the coupling to some quantum degrees of freedom. In particular, we study a one-dimensional spin-singlet superconductor, modeled by the Gross-Neveu field theory, coupled to spin $\frac{1}{2}$ magnetic impurities at its boundaries via a spin-exchange interaction. We solve the model exactly for arbitrary values of the bulk and the impurity coupling strengths using nested coordinate Bethe ansatz and show that the system exhibits a rich boundary phase structure. For a range of couplings, the low energy degrees of freedom form irreducible representations of the supersymmetric $spl(2,1)\otimes spl(2,1)$ algebra which become degenerate at a specific point, indicating the emergence of supersymmetry in the low energy boundary degrees of freedom. We show that at the supersymmetric point there exist exact zero energy modes that map one ground state with the other. We express these in terms of the generators of the algebra.</description>

Abstract: Within the theoretical framework of a recently introduced approach to approximate Lie symmetries of differential equations containing small terms, which is consistent with the principles of perturbative analysis, we define accordingly approximate Q-conditional symmetries of partial differential equations. The approach is illustrated by considering the hyperbolic version of a reaction-diffusion-convection equation. By looking for its first order approximate Q-conditional symmetries, we are able to explicitly determine a large set of non-trivial approximate solutions.</description>

      <title>1D Landau-Ginzburg Superpotential of Big Quantum Cohomology of $\mathbb{CP}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the inverse period map of the Gauss-Manin connection associated with $QH^{*}\bigl(\mathbb{CP}^2\bigr)$ and the Dubrovin construction of Landau-Ginzburg superpotential for Dubrovin-Frobenius manifolds, we construct a one-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg superpotential for the quantum cohomology of $\mathbb{CP}^2$. In the case of small quantum cohomology, the Landau-Ginzburg superpotential is expressed in terms of the cubic root of the $j$-invariant function. For big quantum cohomology, the one-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg superpotential is given by Taylor series expansions whose coefficients are expressed in terms of quasi-modular forms. Furthermore, we express the Landau-Ginzburg superpotential for both small and big quantum cohomology of $QH^{*}\bigl(\mathbb{CP}^2\bigr)$ in closed form as the composition of the Weierstrass $\wp$-function and the universal coverings of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \bigl(\mathbb{Z} \oplus {\rm e}^{\frac{\pi {\rm i}}{3}}\mathbb{Z}\bigr)$ and $\mathbb{C} \setminus (\mathbb{Z} \oplus z\mathbb{Z})$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and analyze a new geometric structure on topological surfaces generalizing the complex structure. To define this so called higher complex structure we use the punctual Hilbert scheme of the plane. The moduli space of higher complex structures is defined and is shown to be a generalization of the classical Teichm\"uller space. We give arguments for the conjectural isomorphism between the moduli space of higher complex structures and Hitchin's component.</description>

      <title>On the deep-water and shallow-water limits of the intermediate long wave equation from a statistical viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study convergence problems for the intermediate long wave equation (ILW), with the depth parameter $\delta &gt; 0$, in the deep-water limit ($\delta \to \infty$) and the shallow-water limit ($\delta \to 0$) from a statistical point of view. In particular, we establish convergence of invariant Gibbs dynamics for ILW in both the deep-water and shallow-water limits. For this purpose, we first construct the Gibbs measures for ILW, $0 &lt; \delta &lt; \infty$. As they are supported on distributions, a renormalization is required. With the Wick renormalization, we carry out the construction of the Gibbs measures for ILW. We then prove that the Gibbs measures for ILW converge in total variation to that for the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in the deep-water limit. In the shallow-water regime, after applying a scaling transformation, we prove that, as $\delta \to 0$, the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW converge weakly to that for the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV). We point out that this second result is of particular interest since the Gibbs measures for the scaled ILW and KdV are mutually singular (whereas the Gibbs measures for ILW and BO are equivalent).
  We also discuss convergence of the associated dynamical problem.
  Lastly, we point out that our results also apply to the generalized ILW equation in the defocusing case, converging to the generalized BO in the deep-water limit and to the generalized KdV in the shallow-water limit. In the non-defocusing case, however, our results can not be extended to a nonlinearity with a higher power due to the non-normalizability of the corresponding Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Even Subgraph and Its Connection to Phase Transitions of Graphical Representations of the Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uniform even subgraph is intimately related to the Ising model, the random-cluster model, the random current model, and the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model. In this paper, we first prove that the uniform even subgraph of $Z^d$ percolates for $d \geq 2$ using its characterisation as the Haar measure on the group of even graphs. We then tighten the result by showing that the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model on $Z^d$ percolates for $d \geq 2$ for edge-weights $x$ lying in some interval $(1-\varepsilon,1]$. Finally, our main theorem is that the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model and random current models corresponding to a supercritical Ising model are always at least critical, in the sense that their two-point correlation functions decay at most polynomially and the expected cluster sizes are infinite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the modeling of the spread of information through a complex, multi-layered network, where the information is transferred from an initial transmitter to a final receiver. The mathematical model is deduced within the framework of operatorial methods, according to the formal mathematical apparatus typical of quantum mechanics. Two different approaches are considered: one based on the ($H,\rho$)-induced dynamics and one on the Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) equation. For each method, numerical results are presented.</description>

      <title>Fidelity decay and error accumulation in random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Gauge Symmetry in (2+1)d Topological Orders: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for understanding symmetries in topological phases in 2+1 dimensions using the string-net model, encompassing both gauge symmetries that preserve anyon species and global symmetries permuting anyon species, including both invertible symmetries describable by groups and noninvertible symmetries described by categories. As an archetypal example, we reveal the first noninvertible categorical gauge symmetry of topological orders in 2+1 dimensions: the Fibonacci gauge symmetry of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, described by the Fibonacci fusion 2-category. Our approach involves two steps: first, establishing duality between different string-net models with Morita equivalent input fusion categories that describe the same topological order; and second, constructing symmetry transformations within the same string-net model when the dual models have isomorphic input fusion categories, achieved by composing duality maps with isomorphisms of degrees of freedom between the dual models.</description>

      <title>Classification of exceptional Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a full classification scheme for exceptional Jacobi operators and polynomials. The classification contains six degeneracy classes according to whether $\alpha,\beta$ or $\alpha\pm\beta$ assume integer values. Exceptional Jacobi operators are in one-to-one correspondence with spectral diagrams, a combinatorial object that describes the number and asymptotic behaviour at the endpoints of $(-1,1)$ of all quasi-rational eigenfunctions of the operator. With a convenient indexing scheme for spectral diagrams, explicit Wronskian and integral construction formulas are given to build the exceptional operators and polynomials from the information encoded in the spectral diagram. In the fully degenerate class $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb N_0$ there exist exceptional Jacobi operators with an arbitrary number of continuous parameters. The classification result is achieved by a careful description of all possible rational Darboux transformations that can be performed on exceptional Jacobi operators.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the effects of quantum deformation in the undeformed Jaynes-Cummings model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model, the time dependence in the coupling parameter allows changes in the forms of the Rabi oscillations. In the inverse problem approach (IPA), the time-dependent coupling parameter is obtained from the resulting population inversion. In this work, we employ the IPA to obtain a time-dependent coupling that reproduces the effects of $\kappa$-deformation in the population inversion of an undeformed JC. This is relevant because it may pave the way for simulating quantum deformation in the JC model and possibly enable an experimental verification in a setting where the coupling can be precisely controlled.</description>

      <title>Multiple radial SLE(0) and classical Calogero-Sutherland System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this second of two articles, we study the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems as the deterministic limits of the random multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems. We construct the multiple radial SLE(0) systems from stationary relations by heuristically taking the limit of partition functions as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the boundary points $\{z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_n\}$. The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. In the deterministic case of $\kappa=0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity form a special class of classical Calogero-Sutherland systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse generating functions for trees and for connected subgraphs on the complete graph, and identify a single scaling profile which applies for both generating functions in a critical window. Our motivation comes from the analysis of the finite-size scaling of lattice trees and lattice animals on a high-dimensional discrete torus, for which we conjecture that the identical profile applies in dimensions $d \ge 8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study log-correlated Gibbs measures on the $d$-dimensional torus with weakly interacting focusing quartic potentials whose coupling constants tend to $0$ as we remove regularization. In particular, we exhibit a phase transition for this model by identifying a critical threshold, separating the weakly and strongly coupling regimes; in the weakly coupling regime, we show that the frequency-truncated measures converge to the base Gaussian measure (possibly with a renormalized $L^2$-cutoff), whereas, in the strongly coupling regime, we prove non-convergence of the frequency-truncated measures, even up to a subsequence. Our result answers an open question posed by Brydges and Slade (1996).</description>

      <title>The supercritical phase of the $\varphi^4$ model is well behaved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we analyse the $\varphi^4$ model on $\mathbb Z^d$ in the supercritical regime $\beta &gt; \beta_c$. We consider a random cluster representation of the $\varphi^4$ model, which corresponds to an Ising random cluster model on a random environment. We prove that the supercritical phase of this percolation model on $\mathbb Z^d$ ($d\geq 2$) is well behaved in the sense that, for every $\beta&gt;\beta_c$, local uniqueness of macroscopic clusters occurs with high probability, uniformly in the boundary conditions. This result provides the basis for renormalisation techniques used to study several fine properties of the supercritical phase. As applications, we prove surface order exponential bounds for the (lower) large deviations of the empirical magnetisation as well as for the spectral gaps of dynamical $\varphi^4$ models in the entire supercritical regime.</description>

      <title>DGenNO: A Novel Physics-aware Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems based on Deep, Generative Probabilistic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated PDE-based, inverse problems is a central task in engineering and physics, yet existing neural operator methods struggle with high-dimensional, discontinuous inputs and require large amounts of {\em labeled} training data. We propose the Deep Generative Neural Operator (DGenNO), a physics-aware framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging a deep, generative, probabilistic model in combination with a set of lower-dimensional, latent variables that simultaneously encode PDE-inputs and PDE-outputs. This formulation can make use of unlabeled data and significantly improves inverse problem-solving, particularly for discontinuous or discrete-valued input functions. DGenNO enforces physics constraints without labeled data by incorporating as virtual observables, weak-form residuals based on compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs). These relax regularity constraints and eliminate higher-order derivatives from the objective function. We also introduce MultiONet, a novel neural operator architecture, which is a more expressive generalization of the popular DeepONet that significantly enhances the approximating power of the proposed model. These innovations make DGenNO particularly effective for challenging forward and inverse, PDE-based problems, such as those involving multi-phase media. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DGenNO achieves higher accuracy across multiple benchmarks while exhibiting robustness to noise and strong generalization to out-of-distribution cases. Its adaptability, and the ability to handle sparse, noisy data while providing probabilistic estimates, make DGenNO a powerful tool for scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss kinetic-based particle optimization methods and variable-sample strategies for problems where the cost function represents the expected value of a random mapping. Kinetic-based optimization methods rely on a consensus mechanism targeting the global minimizer, and they exploit tools of kinetic theory to establish a rigorous framework for proving convergence to that minimizer. Variable-sample strategies replace the expected value by an approximation at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. We combine these approaches and introduce a novel algorithm based on instantaneous collisions governed by a linear Boltzmann-type equation. After proving the convergence of the resulting kinetic method under appropriate parameter constraints, we establish a connection to a recently introduced consensus-based method for solving the random problem in a suitable scaling. Finally, we showcase its enhanced computational efficiency compared to the aforementioned algorithm and validate the consistency of the proposed modeling approaches through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Spinning boson stars in nonlinear sigma models and Universal Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the scalar field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for a family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional target manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions, allowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness. However, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent with those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of such relations is extended to curved target spaces.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Multiple chordal SLE(0) and classical Calogero-Moser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems of type $(n, m)$ for positive integers $n$ and $m$ with $m \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$, extending the construction of~\cite{ABKM20} beyond the previously studied case $n = 2m$.
  By applying integrals of motion associated with the Loewner evolution, we show that, in the $\mathbb{H}$-uniformization with the marked point $q = \infty$, the traces of type $(n, m)$ multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems correspond to the real locus of real rational functions with $n$ real simple critical points, $m$ simple poles, and a pole of order $n - 2m + 1$ at infinity.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that, under a common capacity parametrization, the Loewner dynamics evolve according to the classical Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Conserved Quantities in the Lorenz System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lorenz system, a seminal model in chaos theory, is renowned for its complex dynamics and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This work investigates conserved quantities within the standard Lorenz equations. The system exhibits phase space volume contraction, a characteristic of dissipative systems. Despite the common understanding positing the absence of conserved quantities in its typical chaotic parameter regimes, this study demonstrates that the Lorenz system possesses at least three dynamical constants of motion. The implications of these conserved quantities for the system's chaotic behavior are discussed.</description>

      <title>Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles: Connections and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. Alongside other results, we show that once an $\mathbb{R}^\times$-connection has been chosen, there is a canonical affine connection that is torsionless, but, in general, not compatible with the degenerate metric. The construction of an affine connection is intimately tied to a Kaluza-Klein geometry.</description>
