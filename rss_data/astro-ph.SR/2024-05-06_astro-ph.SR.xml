      <title>A Test of Spectroscopic Age Estimates of White Dwarfs using Wide WD+WD Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf stars have been used for decades as precise and accurate age indicators. This work presents a test of the reliability of white dwarf total ages when spectroscopic observations are available. We conduct follow-up spectroscopy of 148 individual white dwarfs in widely separated double-white-dwarf (WD+WD) binaries. We supplement the sample with 264 previously published white dwarf spectra, as well as 1292 high-confidence white dwarf spectral types inferred from their Gaia XP spectra. We find that spectroscopic fits to optical spectra do not provide noticeable improvement to the age agreement among white dwarfs in wide WD+WD binaries. The median age agreement is $\approx$$1.5\sigma$ for both photometrically and spectroscopically determined total ages, for pairs of white dwarfs with each having a total age uncertaintiy $&lt;$ 20\%. For DA white dwarfs, we further find that photometrically determined atmospheric parameters from spectral energy distribution fitting give better total age agreement ($1.0\sigma$, 0.2 Gyr, or 14\% of the binary's average total age) compared to spectroscopically determined parameters from Balmer-line fits (agreement of $1.5\sigma$, 0.3 Gyr, or 28\% of binary's average total age). We find further evidence of a significant merger fraction among wide WD+WD binaries: across multiple spectroscopically identified samples, roughly 20\% are inconsistent with a monotonically increasing initial-final mass relation. We recommend the acquisition of an identification spectrum to ensure the correct atmospheric models are used in photometric fits in order to determine the most accurate total age of a white dwarf star.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the Observation of Continuous Gravitational Waves from Deformed Fast-spinning White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest within the astrophysics community in highly magnetized and fast-spinning white dwarfs (WDs), commonly referred to as HMWDs. WDs with these characteristics are quite uncommon and possess magnetic fields $\geqslant 10^6$ G, along with short rotation periods ranging from seconds to just a few minutes. Based on our previous work, we analyze the emission of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in HMWDs through two mechanisms: matter accretion and magnetic deformation, which arise due to the asymmetry surrounding the star's rotational axis. Here, we perform a thorough self-consistent analysis, accounting for rotation and employing a realistic equation of state to investigate the stability of stars. Our investigation focuses on the emission of gravitational radiation from six rapidly spinning WDs: five of them are situated within binary systems, while one is an AXP, proposed as a magnetic accreting WD. Furthermore, we apply the matter accretion mechanism alongside the magnetic deformation mechanism to assess the influence of one process on the other. Our discoveries indicate that these WDs could potentially act as GW sources for BBO and DECIGO, depending on specific parameters, such as their mass, the angle ($\alpha$) between the magnetic and rotational axes, and the accumulated mass ($\delta m$) at their magnetic poles, which is influenced by the effect of matter accretion. However, detecting this particular class of stars using the LISA and TianQin space detectors seems unlikely due to the challenging combination of parameters such as a large $\delta m$, a large $\alpha$ angle and a small WD mass value.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Space Weather Events through Analysis of Active Region Magnetograms using Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although space weather events may not directly affect human life, they have the potential to inflict significant harm upon our communities. Harmful space weather events can trigger atmospheric changes that result in physical and economic damages on a global scale. In 1989, Earth experienced the effects of a powerful geomagnetic storm that caused satellites to malfunction, while triggering power blackouts in Canada, along with electricity disturbances in the United States and Europe. With the solar cycle peak rapidly approaching, there is an ever-increasing need to prepare and prevent the damages that can occur, especially to modern-day technology, calling for the need of a comprehensive prediction system. This study aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict instances of space weather (solar flares, coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic storms), based on active region magnetograms of the Sun. This was done through the use of the NASA DONKI service to determine when these solar events occur, then using data from the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory to compile a dataset that includes magnetograms of active regions of the Sun 24 hours before the events. By inputting the magnetograms into a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained from this dataset, it can serve to predict whether a space weather event will occur, and what type of event it will be. The model was designed using a custom architecture CNN, and returned an accuracy of 90.27%, a precision of 85.83%, a recall of 91.78%, and an average F1 score of 92.14% across each class (Solar flare [Flare], geomagnetic storm [GMS], coronal mass ejection [CME]). Our results show that using magnetogram data as an input for a CNN is a viable method to space weather prediction. Future work can involve prediction of the magnitude of solar events.</description>

      <title>Solar Flare Ribbon Fronts. II. Evolution of heating rates in individual flare footpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flare ribbon fronts appear ahead of the bright structures that normally characterise solar flares, and can persist for an extended period of time in spatially localised patches before transitioning to `regular' bright ribbons. They likely represent the initial onset of flare energy deposition into the chromosphere. Chromospheric spectra (e.g. He I 10830A and the Mg II near-UV lines) from ribbon fronts exhibit properties rather different to typical flare behaviour. In prior numerical modelling efforts we were unable to reproduce the long lifetime of ribbon fronts. Here we present a series of numerical experiments that are rather simple but which have important implications. We inject a very low flux of nonthermal electrons ($F = 5\times10^{8}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$) into the chromosphere for 100 s before ramping up to standard flare energy fluxes $(F = 10^{10-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). Synthetic spectra not only sustained their ribbon front-like properties for significantly longer, in the case of harder nonthermal electron spectra the ribbon front behaviour persisted for the entirety of this weak-heating phase. Lengthening or shortening the duration of the weak-heating phase commensurately lengthened or shortened the ribbon front lifetimes. Ribbon fronts transitioned to regular bright ribbons when the upper chromosphere became sufficiently hot and dense, which happened faster for softer nonthermal electron spectra. Thus, the lifetime of flare ribbon fronts are a direct measure of the duration over which a relatively low flux of high energy electrons precipitates to the chromosphere prior to the bombardment of a much larger energy flux.</description>

      <title>Stellar X-ray activity and habitability revealed by ROSAT sky survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the homogeneous X-ray catalog from ROSAT observations, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into stellar X-ray activity-rotation relations for both single and binary stars. Generally, the relation for single stars consists of two distinct regions: a weak decay region, indicating a continued dependence of the magnetic dynamo on stellar rotation rather than a saturation regime with constant activity, and a rapid decay region, where X-ray activity is strongly correlated with the Rossby number. Detailed analysis reveals more fine structures within the relation: in the extremely fast rotating regime, a decrease in X-ray activity was observed with increasing rotation rate, referred to as super-saturation, while in the extremely slow rotating region, the relation flattens, mainly due to the scattering of F stars. This scattering may result from intrinsic variability in stellar activities over one stellar cycle or the presence of different dynamo mechanisms. Binaries exhibit a similar relation to that of single stars while the limited sample size prevented the identification of fine structures in the relation for binaries. We calculated the mass loss rates of planetary atmosphere triggered by X-ray emissions from host stars. Our findings indicate that for an Earth-like planet within the stellar habitable zone, it would easily lose its entire primordial H/He envelope (equating to about 1% of the planetary mass).</description>

      <title>Project Hephaistos - II. Dyson sphere candidates from Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and WISE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is currently being pursued using multiple techniques and in different wavelength bands. Dyson spheres, megastructures that could be constructed by advanced civilizations to harness the radiation energy of their host stars, represent a potential technosignature, that in principle may be hiding in public data already collected as part of large astronomical surveys. In this study, we present a comprehensive search for partial Dyson spheres by analyzing optical and infrared observations from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE. We develop a pipeline that employs multiple filters to identify potential candidates and reject interlopers in a sample of five million objects, which incorporates a convolutional neural network to help identify confusion in WISE data. Finally, the pipeline identifies 7 candidates deserving of further analysis. All of these objects are M-dwarfs, for which astrophysical phenomena cannot easily account for the observed infrared excess emission.</description>

      <title>The Fe i lines and the chromospheric activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral Fe lines are the most abundant in the spectrum of late stars. They are used to obtain different basic stellar parameters such as relative abundances, surface gravity, and effective temperature. However, the centers of many of these lines are formed in the stellar chromosphere, being affected by the changes produced by magnetic activity. Calculating non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) semi-empirical models of the stellar atmosphere, it is possible to study the formation of these lines in detail. We present a new updated model of the Fe i atom, which allows us to calculate 1715 lines of Fe i between 3000 and 7000 A in stars with different levels of chromospheric activity. Preliminary results show the presence of spectral ranges more sensitive to chromospheric heating, suggesting that the lines with greater variations must be taken into account, and should even be excluded, when be used for the purposes described above.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an accretion streamer and a slow wide-angle outflow around FU Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA 12-m, 7-m &amp; Total Power (TP) Array observations of the FU Orionis outbursting system, covering spatial scales ranging from 160 to 25,000 au. The high-resolution interferometric data reveals an elongated $^{12}$CO(2-1) feature previously observed at lower resolution in $^{12}$CO(3-2). Kinematic modeling indicates that this feature can be interpreted as an accretion streamer feeding the binary system. The mass infall rate provided by the streamer is significantly lower than the typical stellar accretion rates (even in quiescent states), suggesting that this streamer alone is not massive enough to sustain the enhanced accretion rates characteristic of the outbursting class prototype. The observed streamer may not be directly linked to the current outburst but rather a remnant of a previous, more massive streamer that may have contributed enough to the disk mass to render it unstable and trigger FU Ori's outburst. The new data detects, for the first time, a vast, slow-moving carbon monoxide molecular outflow emerging from this object. To accurately assess the outflow properties (mass, momentum, kinetic energy), we employed $^{13}$CO(2-1) data to correct for optical depth effects. The analysis indicates that the outflow corresponds to swept-up material not associated with the current outburst, similar to slow-molecular outflows observed around other FUor and Class I protostellar objects.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Peak Solar Flare with a High Turnover Frequency of The Gyrosynchrotron Spectra from the Loop-Top Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of multiple peaks in lightcurves of various wavelengths remains illusive during flares. Here we discuss the flare of SOL2023-05-09T03:54M6.5 with six flux peaks as recorded by a tandem of new microwave and Hard X-ray instruments. According to its microwave spectra, the flare represents a high-turnover frequency (&gt;15 GHz) event. The rather-complete microwave and HXR spectral coverage provides a rare opportunity to uncover the origin of such event together with simultaneous EUV images. We concluded that (1) the microwave sources originates around the top section of the flaring loops with a trend of source spatial dispersion with frequency;(2) the visible movement of the microwave source from peak to peak originates from the process of new flaring loops appearing sequentially along the magnetic neutral line; 3) the optically-thin microwave spectra are hard with the indices varying from -1.2 to -0.4, and the turnover frequency always exceeds 15 GHz; 4) higher turnover/peak frequency corresponds to stronger peak intensity and harder optically-thin spectra. Using the Fokker-Planck and GX simulator codes we obtained a good fit to the observed microwave spectra and spatial distribution of the sources at all peaks, if assuming the radiating energetic electrons have the same spatial distribution and single-power-law spectra but with the number density varying in a range of 30%. We conclude that the particle acceleration in this flare happens in a compact region nearing the looptop. These results provide new constraints on the acceleration of energetic electrons and the underlying flare intermittent reconnection process.</description>

      <title>The colliding-wind binary HD 168112</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio surveys of early-type stars have revealed a number of non-thermal emitters. Most of these have been shown to be binaries, where the collision between the two stellar winds is responsible for the non-thermal emission. HD 168112 is a non-thermal radio emitter, whose binary nature has only recently been confirmed spectroscopically. We obtained independent spectroscopic observations to determine its orbit, in addition to radio observations to see if the thermal or non-thermal nature of the emission changes during the periastron passage. We monitored HD 168112 spectroscopically for a 13 year time span. From these data, we determined the orbital parameters, which we compared to the previous results in the literature. From the spectral index of the radio observations, we found how the nature of the emission changes as the system goes through periastron. Combining our results with other literature data allowed us to further constrain the orbital and stellar parameters. We find HD 168112 to have an orbital period of P = 512.17+0.41-0.11 d, an eccentricity of e = 0.7533+0.0053-0.0124, and a mass ratio close to one. From our spectroscopic modelling, we derived the stellar parameters, but we had difficulty arriving at a spectroscopic mass ratio of one. The radio observations around periastron show only thermal emission, suggesting that most of the synchrotron photons are absorbed in the two stellar winds at that phase. Combining our data with the optical interferometry detection, we could constrain the inclination angle to i ~ 63 deg, and the mass of each component to ~ 26 Msun. We have provided an independent spectroscopic confirmation of the binary nature of HD 168112. Although detected as a non-thermal radio emitter, near periastron the radio emission of this highly eccentric system is thermal and is mainly formed in the colliding-wind region.

      <title>Understanding the effects of spacecraft trajectories through solar coronal mass ejection flux ropes using 3DCOREweb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of spacecraft positioning and trajectory on in situ signatures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Employing the 3DCORE model, a 3D flux rope model that can generate in situ profiles for any given point in space and time, we conduct forward modeling to analyze such signatures for various latitudinal and longitudinal positions, with respect to the flux rope apex, at 0.8au. Using this approach, we explore the appearance of the resulting in situ profiles for different flux rope types, with different handedness and inclination angles, for both high and low twist CMEs. Our findings reveal that even high twist CMEs exhibit distinct differences in signatures between apex hits and flank encounters, with the latter displaying stretched-out profiles with reduced rotation. Notably, constant, non-rotating in situ signatures are only observed for flank encounters of low twist CMEs, suggesting implications for the magnetic field structure within CME legs. Additionally, our study confirms the unambiguous appearance of different flux rope types in in situ signatures, contributing to the broader understanding and interpretation of observational data. Given the model assumptions, this may refute trajectory effects to be the cause for mismatching flux rope types as identified in solar signatures. While acknowledging limitations inherent in our model, such as the assumption of constant twist and non-deformable torus-like shape, we still draw relevant conclusions within the context of global magnetic field structures of CMEs and the potential for distinguishing flux rope types based on in situ observations.</description>

      <title>Source Region and Launch Characteristics of Magnetic-arch-blowout Solar Coronal Mass Ejections Driven by Homologous Compact-flare Blowout Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of four coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originating from homologous blowout jets. All of the blowout jets originated from NOAA active region (AR) 11515 on 2012 July 2, within a time interval of $\approx$14 hr. All of the CMEs were wide (angular widths $\approx$95$-$150$^\circ$), and propagated with speeds ranging between $\approx$300$-$500 km s$^{-1}$ in LASCO coronagraph images. Observations at various EUV wavelengths in Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly images reveal that in all the cases, the source region of the jets lies at the boundary of the leading part of AR 11515 that hosts a small filament before each event. Coronal magnetic field modeling based on nonlinear force free extrapolations indicate that in each case the filament is contained inside of a magnetic flux rope that remains constrained by overlying compact loops. The southern footpoint of each filament is rooted in the negative polarity region where the eruption onsets occur. This negative-polarity region undergoes continuous flux changes, including emergence and cancellation with opposite polarity in the vicinity of the flux rope, and the EUV images reveal brightening episodes near the filament's southeastern footpoint before each eruption. Therefore, these flux changes are likely the cause of the subsequent eruptions. These four homologous eruptions originate near adjacent feet of two large-scale loop systems connecting from that positive-polarity part of the AR to two remote negative-polarity regions, and result in large-scale consequences in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the amplitude of solar cycle 25 from the ratio of sunspot number to sunspot-group area, low latitude activity, and 130-year solar cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analysed the combined data of sunspot groups from Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) during the period 1874-1976 and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) during 1977-2017 and determined the monthly mean, annual mean, and 13-month smoothed monthly mean whole sphere sunspot-group area (WSGA). We have also analysed the monthly mean, annual mean, and 13-month smoothed monthly mean version 2 of international sunspot number (SN) during the period 1874-2017. We fitted the annual mean WSGA and SN data during each of Solar Cycles 12-24 separately to the linear and nonlinear (parabola) forms. In the cases of Solar Cycles 14, 17, and 24 the nonlinear fits are found better than the linear fits. We find that there exists a secular decreasing trend in the slope of the WSGA-SN linear relation during Solar Cycles 12-24. A secular decreasing trend is also seen in the coefficient of the first order term of the nonlinear relation. The existence of ~77-year variation is seen in the ratio of the amplitude to WSGA at the maximum epoch of solar cycle. From the pattern of this long-term variation of the ratio we inferred that Solar Cycle 25 will be larger than both Solar Cycles 24 and 26. Using an our earlier method (now slightly revised) we predicted 127 (plus or minus 26) and 141 (plus or minus 19) for the amplitude of Solar Cycle~25. Based on ~130-year periodicity found in the cycle-to-cycle variation of the amplitudes of Solar Cycles 12-24 we find the shape of Solar Cycle 25 would be similar to that of Solar Cycle 13 and predicted for Solar Cycle 25 the amplitude 135 (plus or minus 8), maximum epoch 2024.21 (March 2024) plus or minus 6-month, and end epoch 2032.21 (March 2032) plus or minus 6-month with SN ~4.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Uncertainties of the Gaia DR3 Catalog Based on Data on Wide Binary Stars of the Galaxy Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The catalog of wide binary stars by El-Badry et al. (2021) [arXiv:2101.05282], created on the basis of Gaia EDR3 data and including more than a million pairs, was used to analyze Gaia DR3 data obtained independently for their components. By comparison with the model distribution, it is shown that the catalog contains approximately 2.5 times fewer binary stars than would be expected in the absence of spatial incompleteness. It is confirmed that the radius of spatial completeness of the catalog is on average close to 200 pc and depends on the absolute magnitude of the main component. The spatial density of binary stars in the catalog depends weakly on the difference in the magnitudes of the components, and significantly depends on the physical distance between the components. A high correlation between the degree of agreement between the characteristics and the reliability of the pair was found for radial velocities. Qualitative agreement is observed for metallicity [Fe/H] estimates and, to a lesser extent, for absorption A_G estimates. No agreement was found for the ages of the stars, which indicates their great uncertainty in the ensemble, consisting mainly of main sequence stars. Age estimates for pairs with evolved components show significantly better agreement than for the dataset as a whole. Using the parameters of the components of the pairs from Gaia DR3, an independent estimate of the uncertainties in the radial velocities and metallicities depending on the apparent magnitude of the sources was performed. Estimates of the probable median values of errors in the radial velocities and metallicities of Gaia DR3 sources are proposed. Depending on the apparent magnitude, they exceed the median error values given in the catalog: for radial velocities by 1.5-3 times, for metallicities [Fe/H] by 7-25 times.</description>

      <title>On the source of the Fe K-alpha emission in T Tauri Stars. Radiation induced by relativistic electrons during flares. An application to RY Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T Tauri Stars (TTSs) are magnetically active stars that accrete matter from the inner border of the surrounding accretion disc; plasma gets trapped into the large scale magnetic structures and falls onto the star, heating the surface through the so-called accretion shocks. The X-ray spectra of the TTSs show prominent Fe II Kalpha fluorescence emission at 6.4keV that cannot be explained in a pure accretion scenario. Neither, it can be produced by the hot coronal plasma.
  TTSs display all signs of magnetic activity and magnetic reconnection events are expected to occur frequently. In these events, electrons may get accelerated to relativistic speeds and their interaction with the environmental matter may result in Fe Kalpha emission. It is the aim of this work to evaluate the expected Fe Kalpha emission in the context of the TTS research and compare it with the actual Fe Kalpha measurements obtained during the flare detected while monitoring RY Tau with the XMM-Newton satellite. The propagation of high-energy electrons in dense gas generates a cascade of secondary particles that results in an electron shower of random nature whose evolution and radiative throughput is simulated in this work using the Monte Carlo code PENELOPE. A set of conditions representing the environment of the TTSs where these showers may impinge has been taken into account to generate a grid of models that can aid to the interpretation of the data. The simulations show that the electron beams produce a hot spot at the point of impact; strong Fe Kalpha emission and X-ray continuum radiation are produced by the spot. This emission is compatible with RY Tau observations. The Fe Kalpha emission observed in TTSs could be produced by beams of relativistic electrons accelerated in magnetic reconnection events during flares.</description>

      <title>Dark Kinetic Heating of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark kinetic heating of neutron stars has been previously studied as a promising dark matter detection avenue. Kinetic heating occurs when dark matter is sped up to relativistic speeds in the gravitational well of high-escape velocity objects, and deposits kinetic energy after becoming captured by the object, thereby increasing its temperature. We show that dark kinetic heating can be significant even in objects with low-escape velocities, such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs, increasing the discovery potential of such searches. This can occur if there is a long-range dark force, creating a "dark escape velocity", leading to heating rates substantially larger than those expected from neutron stars. We consequently set constraints on dark sector parameters using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and JWST data on Super-Jupiter WISE 0855-0714, and map out future sensitivity to the dark matter scattering cross section below $10^{-40}~{\rm cm}^2$. We compare dark kinetic heating rates of other lower escape velocity objects such as the Earth, Sun, and white dwarfs, finding complementary kinetic heating signals are possible depending on particle physics parameters.</description>

      <title>A catalog of newly discovered close binary open clusters in the Milky Way from Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented precision in Gaia measurements of parallax allows us to capture a larger number of binary clusters. With the releases of Gaia data, the number of Galactic open clusters (OCs) increases with great rapidity, providing an excellent opportunity to confirm more binary clusters in the Milky Way. Using a recently released OC catalog, we employed the photometric and astrometric data of and OCs and their member stars to find close binary open clusters (CBOCs). The 3-dimensional spatial coordinates, proper motions, and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and a new CBOC identification technique are used for identifying CBOCs. We finally found 13 new pairs of CBOCs. The fundamental parameters of these CBOCs are determined by fitting the CMDs to the isochrones of stellar populations. When we check the similarity of reddenings, ages and metallicities of the sub-clusters of CBOCs, eight CBOCs are shown to be primordial binary open clusters (PBOCs). This paper reports the detailed data of the 13 newly found CBOCs, which will help us to do many further researches on binary star clusters.</description>

      <title>MARTIANS (MARs2020, TIANwen and So on) would see more potentially hazardous asteroids than Earthlings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are a special subset of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) that can come close to the Earth and are large enough to cause significant damage in the event of an impact. Observations and researches of Earth-PHAs have been underway for decades. Here, we extend the concept of PHAs to Mars and study the feasibility of detecting Mars-PHAs in the near future. We focus on PHAs that truly undergo close approaches with a planet (dubbed CAPHAs) and aim to compare the actual quantities of Earth-CAPHAs and Mars-CAPHAs by conducting numerical simulations incorporating the Yarkovsky effect, based on observed data of the main asteroid belt. The estimated number of Earth-CAPHAs and Mars-CAPHAs are 4675 and 16910, respectively. The occurrence frequency of Mars-CAPHAs is about 52 per year, which is 2.6 times that of Earth-CAPHAs, indicating significant potential for future Mars-based observations. Furthermore, a few Mars-CAPHAs are predicted to be observable even from Earth around the time of next Mars opposition in 2025.</description>

      <title>Information content of JWST spectra of WASP-39b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WASP-39b was observed using several different JWST instrument modes and the spectra were published in a series of papers by the ERS team. The current study examines the information content of these spectra measured using the different instrument modes, focusing on the complexity of the temperature-pressure profiles and number of chemical species warranted by the data. We examine if H2O, CO, CO2, K, H2S, CH4, and SO2 are detected in each of the instrument modes. Two Bayesian inference methods are used to perform atmospheric retrievals: standard nested sampling and supervised machine learning of the random forest (trained on a model grid). For nested sampling, Bayesian model comparison is used as a guide to identify the set of models with the required complexity to explain the data. Generally, non-isothermal transit chords are needed to fit the transmission spectra of WASP-39b, although the complexity of the Tp-profile required is mode-dependent. The minimal set of chemical species needed to fit a spectrum is mode-dependent as well, and also depends on whether grey or non-grey clouds are assumed. When a non-grey cloud model is used to fit the G395H spectrum, it generates a spectral continuum that compensates for the H2O opacity. The same compensation is absent when fitting the non-grey cloud model to the PRISM spectrum (which has broader wavelength coverage), suggesting that it is spurious. The interplay between the cloud spectral continuum and the H2O opacity determines if SO2 is needed to fit either spectrum. The inferred elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen and the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios are all mode- and model-dependent, and should be interpreted with caution. Bayesian model comparison does not always offer a clear path forward for favouring specific retrieval models (e.g. grey versus non-grey clouds) and thus for enabling unambiguous interpretations of exoplanet spectra.</description>

      <title>Close Encounters of Wide Binaries Induced by the Galactic Tide: Implications for Stellar Mergers and Gravitational-Wave Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A substantial fraction of stars can be found in wide binaries with projected separations between $\sim10^2$ and $10^5\,\rm AU$. In the standard lore of binary physics, these would evolve as effectively single stars that remotely orbit one another on stationary Keplerian ellipses. However, embedded in their Galactic environment their low binding energy makes them exceptionally prone to perturbations from the gravitational potential of the Milky Way and encounters with passing stars. Employing a fully relativistic $N$-body integration scheme, we study the impact of these perturbations on the orbital evolution of wide binaries along their trajectory through the Milky Way. Our analysis reveals that the torques exerted by the Galaxy can cause large-amplitude oscillations of the binary eccentricity to $1-e\lesssim10^{-8}$. As a consequence, the wide binary members pass close to each other at periapsis, which, depending on the type of binary, potentially leads to a mass transfer or collision of stars or to an inspiral and subsequent merger of compact remnants due to gravitational-wave radiation. Based on a simulation of $10^5$ wide binaries across the Galactic field, we find that this mechanism could significantly contribute to the rate of stellar collisions and binary black hole mergers as inferred from observations of Luminous Red Novae and gravitational-wave events by LIGO/Virgo/Kagra. We conclude that the dynamics of wide binaries, despite their large mean separation, can give rise to extreme interactions between stars and compact remnants.</description>

      <title>MHD Modeling of the Molecular Filament Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of a cylindrical molecular cloud with the help of the FLASH code. The cloud collapses rapidly along its radius without any signs of fragmentation in the simulations without magnetic field. The radial collapse of the cloud is stopped by the magnetic pressure gradient in the simulations with parallel magnetic field. Cores with high density form at the cloud ends during further evolution. The core densities are $n \approx 1.7 \cdot 10^{8}$ and $2 \cdot 10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the cases with initial magnetic field strengths $B = 1.9 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and $6 \cdot 10^{-4}$ G, respectively. The cores move toward the cloud center with supersonic speeds $|v_{z}|=3.6$ and $5.3$ km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. The sizes of the cores along the filaments radius and filament main axis are $d_{r} = 0.0075$ pc and $d_{z} = 0.025$ pc, $d_{r} = 0.03$ pc and $d_{z} = 0.025$ pc, respectively. The masses of the cores increase during the filament evolution and lie in range of $\approx 10-20\,M_\odot$. According to our results, the cores observed at the edges of molecular filaments can be a result of the filament evolution with parallel magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Four-hundred Very Metal-poor Stars Studied with LAMOST and Subaru. III. Dynamically Tagged Groups and Chemodynamical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very metal-poor (VMP) stars record the signatures of early accreted galaxies, making them essential tools for unraveling the early stages of Galaxy formation. Understanding the origin of VMP stars requires comprehensive studies of their chemical compositions and kinematics, which are currently lacking. Hence, we conduct a chemodynamical analysis of 352 VMP stars selected from one of the largest uniform high-resolution VMP star samples, jointly obtained from LAMOST and Subaru. We apply a friends-of-friends clustering algorithm to the master catalog of this high-resolution sample, which consists of 5778 VMP stars. It results in 131 dynamically tagged groups with 89 associated with known substructures in the Milky Way, including Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Thamnos, Helmi streams, Sequoia, Wukong, Pontus, and the very metal-poor disk (VMPD). Our findings are: (i) the VMPD shows lower Zn abundances than the rest, which indicates that it could be a relic of small stellar systems; (ii) Sequoia shows moderately high r-process abundances; (iii) Helmi streams show deficiencies in carbon and light neutron-capture elements; (iv) the fraction of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with no enhancement in heavy elements (CEMP-no stars) seems low in the VMPD and the Helmi streams; and (v) a subgroup in GSE exhibits a very high fraction of r-process enhanced stars, with four out of five showing [Eu/Fe]&gt; +1.0. The abundance patterns of other elements in VMP substructures largely match the whole VMP sample. We also study large-scale correlations between abundance ratios and kinematics without classifying stars into substructures, but it does not yield significant correlations once the overall chemical evolution is considered for most elements.</description>

      <title>A census of new globular clusters in the Galactic bulge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of known globular clusters in the Galactic bulge has been increasing steadily thanks to different new surveys. The aim of this study is to provide a census of the newly revealed globular clusters in the Galactic bulge, and analyze their characteristics. In recent years, many globular clusters have been discovered or identified. The stellar populations to which they belong are indicated in their original studies: they are mostly bulge clusters, with some identified as disk or halo members. We collected 41 new globular clusters revealed in the last decade and compared them to the known bulge clusters. The new clusters are intrinsically faint with $M_V$ of around -6.0 mag. The distance to the Sun of the ensemble of well-known and new bulge clusters is compatible with the Galactocentric distance measurements from the Galactic black hole location. The ensemble sample shows metallicity peaks at [Fe/H] ~ -1.08 $\pm$ 0.35 and -0.51 $\pm$ 0.25 dex, confirming previous findings. The age-metallicity relation of the new clusters younger than 10 Gyr is compatible with that of the ex situ samples of the dwarf galaxies Sagittarius, Canis Majoris, and Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage. The clusters with ages between 11.5 and 13.5 Gyr show no age-metallicity relation, because they are all old. This is compatible with their formation in situ in the early Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a cyclotron absorption line and spectral transition in EXO 2030+375 during 2021 giant outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on HXMT observations of EXO 2030+375 during its 2021 giant outburst, we report the analysis of pulse variations and the broadband X-ray spectrum, and find the presence of a potential cyclotron resonant scattering feature with the fundamental line at 47 keV from both average spectra and phase-resolved spectroscopy. During the outburst, the source reached an X-ray luminosity of $\sim 1\times 10^{38}$ erg /cm/s from 2-105 keV at a distance of 7.1 kpc. The X-ray pulsar at the spin period of 41.27 seconds exhibits complex timing and spectral variations with both energy and luminosity during the outburst. The shapes of the pulses profiles show the single main peak above 20 keV, while appear to exhibit multi-peak patterns in low energy bands, and the transition of pulse profiles from multi-peak to single-peak is observed at $0.8\times 10^{38}$ erg /cm/s, which suggests the evolution from the subcritical luminosity (pencil-beam dominated) to supercritical luminosity (fan-beam dominated) regimes. A dip structure before the energy of the cyclotron resonant scattering features is found in the pulse fraction-energy relation near the peak luminosity. A detailed analysis of spectral parameters showed that the power-law photon index exhibits three distinct trends as luminosity increases, and these changes also signify a spectral transition from sub-critical to super-critical regimes. The critical luminosity infers the magnetic field of $(4.8-6.0)\times 10^{12}$ G, which supports the presence of the cyclotron line at 47 keV. A Comptonization model applied for the broad X-ray spectra during the outburst also suggests the surface magnetic field ranging from $(5-9)\times 10^{12}$ G.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemistry of an astrophysical environment is closely coupled to its dynamics, the latter often found to be complex. Hence, to properly model these environments a 3D context is necessary. However, solving chemical kinetics within a 3D hydro simulation is computationally infeasible for a even a modest parameter study. In order to develop a feasible 3D hydro-chemical simulation, the classical chemical approach needs to be replaced by a faster alternative. We present mace, a Machine learning Approach to Chemistry Emulation, as a proof-of-concept work on emulating chemistry in a dynamical environment. Using the context of AGB outflows, we have developed an architecture that combines the use of an autoencoder (to reduce the dimensionality of the chemical network) and a set of latent ordinary differential equations (that are solved to perform the temporal evolution of the reduced features). Training this architecture with an integrated scheme makes it possible to successfully reproduce a full chemical pathway in a dynamical environment. mace outperforms its classical analogue on average by a factor 26. Furthermore, its efficient implementation in PyTorch results in a sub-linear scaling with respect to the number of hydrodynamical simulation particles.</description>

Abstract: In circumstellar disks around young stars, the gravitational influence of nascent planets produces telltale patterns in density, temperature, and kinematics. To better understand these signatures, we first performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a 0.012 $M_{\odot}$ disk, with a Saturn-mass planet orbiting circularly in-plane at 40 au. We tested four different disk thermodynamic prescriptions (in increasing order of complexity, local isothermality, $\beta$-cooling, two-temperature radiation hydrodynamics, and three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics), finding that $\beta$-cooling offers a reasonable approximation for the three-temperature approach when the planet is not massive or luminous enough to substantially alter the background temperature and density structure. Thereafter, using the three-temperature scheme, we relaxed this assumption, simulating a range of different planet masses (Neptune-mass, Saturn-mass, Jupiter-mass) and accretion luminosities (0, $10^{-3} L_{\odot}$) in the same disk. Our investigation revealed that signatures of disk-planet interaction strengthen with increasing planet mass, with circumplanetary flows becoming prominent in the high-planet-mass regime. Accretion luminosity, which adds pressure support around the planet, was found to weaken the midplane Doppler-flip, potentially visible in optically thin tracers like C$^{18}$O, while strengthening the spiral signature, particularly in upper disk layers sensitive to thicker lines, like those of $^{12}$CO.</description>

      <title>Hall effect on the joint cascades of magnetic energy and helicity in helical magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helical magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with Hall effects is ubiquitous in heliophysics and plasma physics, such as star formation and solar activities, and its intrinsic mechanisms are still not clearly explained. Direct numerical simulations reveal that when the forcing scale is comparable to the ion inertial scale, Hall effects induce remarkable cross helicity. It then suppresses the inverse cascade efficiency, leading to the accumulation of large-scale magnetic energy and helicity. The process is accompanied by the breaking of current sheets via filaments along magnetic fields. Using the Ulysses data, the numerical findings are separately confirmed. These results suggest a novel mechanism wherein small-scale Hall effects could strongly affect large-scale magnetic fields through cross helicity.</description>

      <title>An Image Quality Evaluation and Masking Algorithm Based On Pre-trained Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing amount of astronomical data, there is an increasing need for automated data processing pipelines, which can extract scientific information from observation data without human interventions. A critical aspect of these pipelines is the image quality evaluation and masking algorithm, which evaluates image qualities based on various factors such as cloud coverage, sky brightness, scattering light from the optical system, point spread function size and shape, and read-out noise. Occasionally, the algorithm requires masking of areas severely affected by noise. However, the algorithm often necessitates significant human interventions, reducing data processing efficiency. In this study, we present a deep learning based image quality evaluation algorithm that uses an autoencoder to learn features of high quality astronomical images. The trained autoencoder enables automatic evaluation of image quality and masking of noise affected areas. We have evaluated the performance of our algorithm using two test cases: images with point spread functions of varying full width half magnitude, and images with complex backgrounds. In the first scenario, our algorithm could effectively identify variations of the point spread functions, which can provide valuable reference information for photometry. In the second scenario, our method could successfully mask regions affected by complex regions, which could significantly increase the photometry accuracy. Our algorithm can be employed to automatically evaluate image quality obtained by different sky surveying projects, further increasing the speed and robustness of data processing pipelines.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae of the Large Magellanic Cloud I: A multiwavelength analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) have three main components: a central star (CS), ionised gas and dust in the nebula. Each of them contains critical chemical fingerprints of their evolution, serving as tracers of the evolution, nucleosynthesis and dust production that occurred during the preceding asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. We aim to build a bridge to link the PN phase to the evolution of their progenitors, trying to better understand the dust production and mass-loss mechanism during the final AGB phase. Here, we present a comprehensive study of nine Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) spherical or elliptical PNe whose observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the infrared (IR) are available in the literature. We characterize nebulae and CSs, finding information as the amount of gas that makes up the nebula and the dust that surrounds the CS, necessary to reconstruct the evolutionary history of mass-loss and dust production. We compare the observed energy distribution of the selected PNe to that obtained from photoionization modeling, taking into account the presence of dust. The physical and chemical parameters of the central stars are then compared with the predictions from the evolutionary tracks. We characterized the source, assigning to each CS a progenitor, early-AGB mass. We estimated the mass of the nebula and the dust-to-gas ratio. For 5 objects, we find evidence for the presence of a near-IR bump, which would be connected to the presence of hot dust.</description>

      <title>Safety first: Stability and dissipation of line-tied force-free flux tubes in magnetized coronae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetized plasma columns and extended magnetic structures with both footpoints anchored to a surface layer are an important building block of astrophysical dissipation models. Current loops shining in X-rays during the growth of plasma instabilities are observed in the corona of the Sun and are expected to exist in highly magnetized neutron star magnetospheres and accretion disk coronae. For varying twist and system sizes, we investigate the stability of line-tied force-free flux tubes and the dissipation of twist energy during instabilities using linear analysis and time-dependent force-free electrodynamics simulations. Kink modes ($m=1$) and efficient magnetic energy dissipation develop for plasma safety factors $q\lesssim 1$, where $q$ is the inverse of the number of magnetic field line windings per column length. Higher-order fluting modes ($m&gt;1$) can distort equilibrium flux tubes for $q&gt;1$ but induce significantly less dissipation. In our analysis, the characteristic pitch $\tilde{\mu}_0$ of flux tube field lines determines the growth rate ($\propto \tilde{\mu}_0^3$) and minimum wavelength of the kink instability ($\propto \tilde{\mu}_0^{-1}$). We use these scalings to determine a minimum flux tube length for the growth of the kink instability for any given $\tilde{\mu}_0$. By drawing analogies to idealized magnetar magnetospheres with varying regimes of boundary shearing rates, we discuss the expected impact of the pitch-dependent growth rates for magnetospheric dissipation in magnetar conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the kinetic properties of proton and alpha beams in the Alfv\'enic wind observed by SWA-PAS onboard Solar Orbiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problems of heating and acceleration of solar wind particles are of significant and enduring interest in astrophysics. The interactions between waves and particles are crucial in determining the distributions of proton and alpha particles, resulting in non-Maxwellian characteristics including temperature anisotropies and particle beams. These processes can be better understood as long as the beam can be separated from the core for the two major components of the solar wind. We utilized an alternative numerical approach that leverages the clustering technique employed in Machine Learning to differentiate the primary populations within the velocity distribution, rather than employing the conventional bi-Maxwellian fitting method. Separation of the core and beam revealed new features for protons and alphas. We estimated that the total temperature of the two beams was slightly higher than that of their respective cores, and the temperature anisotropy for the cores and beams was larger than 1. We concluded that the temperature ratio between alphas and protons largely over 4 is due to the presence of a massive alpha beam, which is approximately 50\% of the alpha core. We provided evidence that the alpha core and beam populations are sensitive to Alfv\'enic fluctuations and the surfing effect found in the literature can be recovered only when considering the core and beam as a single population. Several similarities between proton and alpha beams would suggest a common and local generation mechanism not shared with the alpha core, which may not have necessarily been accelerated and heated locally.</description>

      <title>On the Pair-Instability Supernova origin of J1010+2358</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first (Pop III) stars formed only out of H and He and were likely more massive than present-day stars. Massive Pop III stars in the range 140-260 M$_\odot$ are predicted to end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), enriching the environment with a unique abundance pattern, with high ratios of odd to even elements. Recently, the most promising candidate for a pure descendant of a zero-metallicity massive PISN (260 M$_{\odot}$) was discovered by the LAMOST survey, the star J1010+2358. However, the key elements to verify the high PISN contribution, C and Al, were missing from the analysis. To rectify this, we obtained and analyzed a high-resolution VLT/UVES spectrum, correcting for 3D and/or non-LTE effects. Our measurements of both C and Al give much higher values (~1 dex) than expected from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Furthermore, we find significant discrepancies with the previous analysis, and therefore a much less pronounced odd-even pattern. Thus, we show that J1010+2358 cannot be a pure descendant of a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN. Instead, we find that the best fit model consists of a 13 M$_{\odot}$ Pop II core-collapse supernova combined with a Pop III supernova. Alternative, less favoured solutions $(\chi^2/\chi^2_{\rm best}\approx2.3)$ include a 50% contribution from a 260 M$_{\odot}$ PISN, or a 40% contribution from a Pop III type Ia supernova. Ultimately, J1010+2358 is certainly a unique star giving insights into the earliest chemical enrichment, however, this star is not a pure PISN descendant.</description>

Abstract: The effective interaction of a neutrino with a photon in magnetized plasma is obtained from a strong field expansion in the electroweak standard model. The interaction is expressed by a Chern-Simons form of the neutrino current and the electromagnetic vector potential of the coupling strength proportional to $\frac{n_e}{B} \times e G_F$. The derivation of the interaction Lagrangian and its properties are presented.</description>

      <title>The Basic Iterative Deconvolution: A fast instrumental point-spread function deconvolution method that corrects for light that is scattered out of the field of view of a detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A point-spread function describes the optics of an imaging system and can be used to correct collected images for instrumental effects. The state of the art for deconvolving images with the point-spread function is the Richardson-Lucy algorithm; however, despite its high fidelity, it is slow and cannot account for light scattered out of the field of view of the detector. We reinstate the Basic Iterative Deconvolution (BID) algorithm, a deconvolution algorithm that considers photons scattered out of the field of view of the detector, and extend it for image subregion deconvolutions. Its runtime is 1.8 to 7.1 faster than the Richardson-Lucy algorithm for 4096 x 4096 pixels images and up to an additional factor of 150 for subregions of 250 x 250 pixels. We test the extended BID algorithm for solar images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and find that the deviations between the reconstructed intensities of BID and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm are smaller than 1%.</description>

      <title>Ephemeris Matching Reveals False Positive Validated and Candidate Planets from the K2 Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data from the Kepler space telescope have led to the discovery of thousands of planet candidates. Most of these candidates are likely to be real exoplanets, but a significant number of false positives still contaminate the sample, especially in candidate lists from the K2 mission. Identifying and rejecting the false positives lurking in the planet candidates sample is important for prioritizing follow-up resources and measuring the most accurate population statistics. Here, we identify false positives in the K2 planet candidate sample using a technique called "ephemeris matching," in which we compare the period and transit time of different signals. When signals from different stars show the same period and time of transit, we can conclude that at least one of the two signals is contamination. We identify 43 false positives among published K2 planet candidates (nearly 2% of the complete list), one of which (K2-256 b) was previously validated as genuine exoplanet. This work increases the reliability of the K2 planet sample and helps boost confidence in the surviving planet candidates.</description>

      <title>The effects of stellar feedback on molecular clumps in the Lagoon Nebula (M8)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is host to multiple regions with recent and ongoing massive star formation. With M8-Main and M8 East, two prominent regions of massive star formation have been studied in detail over the past years, while large parts of the nebula have received little attention. These largely unexplored regions comprise a large sample of molecular clumps that are affected by the presence of massive O- and B-type stars. We establish an inventory of species observed towards 37 known molecular clumps in M8 by conducting an unbiased line survey for each clump. For this, we used APEX and the IRAM 30m telescope for pointed on-off observations on the clumps. These observations cover bandwidths of 53GHz and 40GHz in frequency ranges from 210GHz to 280GHz and from 70GHz to 117GHz, respectively. Temperatures are derived from rotational transitions of CH3CN, CH3C2H and para-H2CO. Additional archival data from the Spitzer, Herschel, MSX, APEX, WISE, JCMT and AKARI telescopes are used to derive physical parameters of the dust emission by fitting spectral energy distributions to the observed flux densities. Across the observed M8 region, we identify 346 transitions from 70 different molecular species, including isotopologues. We detect tracers of photo-dissociation regions across all the clumps and 38% of these clumps show signs of star formation. We find that PDR tracers are most abundant in clumps with relatively lower H2 column densities. When comparing M8 clumps to ATLASGAL sources at similar distances, we find them to be slightly less massive and have compatible luminosities and radii. This possibly indicates a fragmentation of the gas caused by the O- and B-type stars. In contrast, dust temperatures of the clumps in M8 are found to be increased by approximately 5K (25%) indicating substantial external heating of the clumps by radiation of the present massive stars.</description>

      <title>Bumpy Superluminous Supernovae Powered by Magnetar-star Binary Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as "magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this Letter, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. We suggest that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This "magnetar-star binary engine" model offers a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe. The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.</description>
